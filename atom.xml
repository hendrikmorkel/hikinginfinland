<p>Oh, how I love the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/10/snow-and-sunshine-on-the-via-dinarica.html">Balkans</a> and their tasty food! I have very fond memories of Kenan cooking up some excellent meals on our Via Dinarica hikes, so trying the Balkan Risotto from Trek’N Eat should be like a trip down memory lane. This is the first meat meal I’m eating in the <em>How Does It Taste?</em> Series, and I do like me some meaty meals after a long day on the trail or when I was out mountaineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/4jBr_W4iGi4">Watch the video</a> to see how I like this meal:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4jBr_W4iGi4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><strong>In short:</strong> This is a very good backpacking meal that’s pretty neutral in taste - there’s nothing that dominates and in a time where you can get very salty or very spicy foods it is nice to test a meal that is more neutral and fills your belly with good, natural ingredients. It’s a bit heavy maybe at 190 g and I find the package design a wee bit untidy, but as Trek’N Eat is updating the design for 2018 I imagine this will be a thing of the past. If you’re now curious about the Balkan Risotto you can buy it directly from <a href="https://www.trekneat.com/en/de/108-8018568-tne-balkan-risotto">Trek’N Eat</a> or at the <a href="https://www.outdoorfoodshop.de/en/beef/37-balkan-risotto-by-trekn-eat-4015753185689.html">Outdoor Food Shop</a>.</p>

<p>Our seven day backpacking trip through the Cairngorms is now over and it was fantastic. It was my first time in Scotland (I’ve been to the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/lake-district/">Lake District</a> before) and I loved every moment of it - except maybe those few hours where I was hiking on a terrible “path” up to Corrour Bothy! Expect a full trip report in the next weeks and some accompanying articles, but for the moment enjoy these impressions from the Cairngorms.</p>

<p>Remember my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/05/reimago.html">ReimaGo Review</a> from the spring? Well, we feel it’s time for an update on how the <a href="https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1173541864&amp;as=1179503632&amp;t=2&amp;tk=1&amp;url=https://www.reima.com/fi/ReimaGO/ReimaGO%C2%AE-sensori/p/599160-9990">sensor</a> and the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/fi/app/reimago/id1083484265?mt=8">app</a> have performed and developed over the last six months.</p>

<h2 id="the-reimago-app">The ReimaGo App</h2>

<p>Back in our spring review the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=hikingfinland&amp;utm_campaign=aw17">ReimaGo App</a> had 15 levels and we were almost through them in a matter of weeks (which means our son was very active and collected lots of points to move his avatar forward through the ReimaGo World). We already knew by then that our son was plenty enough outside (he only uses the Sensor in his outside jacket), but what we learned then too was that when it gets too warm for the jacket he doesn’t collect any points (even if he’s outside) - we were for example in the end of May for two weeks in Germany, and with it being the hottest May on record in Germany ever (we had every day over 30°C degrees, with five days even having over 35°C!) he never wore the jacket and wasn’t “active” those two weeks, even if we were every day outside. Sure, there’s a rubber hand strap that comes with the sensor, but we didn’t have it with us and even now we seldom use it. We really hope that for next year Reima releases some summer garments which have the ReimaGo pocket which can be worn in warm weather.</p>

<p>Anyway, the ReimaGo App. It had a major update since the spring and now there’s over 40 Levels on the new globe map, which lets you travel around the world. This is positive as it makes the game of being outside more long-lasting - lets see if Reima will add more levels once the first kids start to reach the last levels. There’s now also a little story about the avatar (Goey) and how he animates kids to go outside, it’s a nice touch. Our son still loves to move his avatar forward and is happy each time he gets to finish a Level, and for us parents its still very good to see how much he is outside each day and week. The app also still is a good motivator to get him out if it isn’t a great day outside, which is pretty nice. A <em>“Lets go collect some ReimaGo points so you can finish that level”</em> works very well to motivate him to get dressed and go for a walk or play in the garden. The usability of the app still is the same, it’s OK but not mind-blowing - simple and does its job well. Finally, the app also lets you join the #MillionHoursOfJoy campaign easily, which I’ll talk about next.</p>

<h2 id="kidventure-aka-millionhoursofjoy">Kidventure aka #MillionHoursOfJoy</h2>

<p>I was along at the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-2017/">OutDoor Friedrichshafen</a> during the launch of the <a href="https://www.reima.com/int/kidventure?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=hikingfinland&amp;utm_campaign=kidventure">Kidventure campaign</a>. The idea is to challenge kids around the globe to spend more time outdoors, and hence to collect together a million hours of time spend in the outdoors. You can participate via the above linked Website if you have not yet a ReimaGo Sensor, or if you have the latter then it’s super easy to join the challenge by signing up via the app and then automatically all your hours of outdoor time will be donated to the project (as far as I can tell, you don’t lose anything either =). You also can use the #MillionHoursOfJoy Hashtag on Social Media when you’re out there with your kids - because remember <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/get-out-into-nature-because-itsgreatoutthere.html">#ItsGreatOutThere</a> =) If you compete in the campaign you also have the chance to win prizes each week, and the grand prize is a winter week in Lapland - a very nice experience for kids, as <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/winter-family-adventures-in-pyha-luosto.html">we</a> <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/04/hetta-winter-adventures-in-finnish-lapland.html">know</a>! We think this is a great initiative - getting kids outdoors is always positive as it allows them to become better people; instead of sitting inside in front of a computer or TV kids should be outside and building huts, exploring the forests and be in nature. Thus, if you feel so too - join the campaign and go outside with your kids!</p>

<p>Four days, 124 km, great infrastructure, beautiful autumn colours and a wild river in Sweden - the <a href="https://www.visitumea.se/en/book/to-do/a475875/vandra_langs_orealven__475875/showdetails">Öreälvsleden</a> is a trail that rewards. While I go through the thousands of photos I took during my hike and edit the video here’s some first impressions from this beautiful trail in Västerbotten, Sweden.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37305380575/in/dateposted/" title="Start of the trail!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4441/37305380575_55f457cb81_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Start of the trail!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The start of the trail for me, just a bit outside of Örträsk. Skin-out weight: Too heavy.</p>

<p>A perfect packrafting river, I made the stupid last-minute decision to not take the packraft. Next time I won’t make that mistake!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37131733892/in/dateposted/" title="Lingonberries"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4404/37131733892_09f9285b1e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lingonberries" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Lingonberries were ripe and plentiful.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37113686836/in/dateposted/" title="Tasty Dinner!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4368/37113686836_bb40866c97_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tasty Dinner!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There was tasty food in the evenings.</p>

<p>The Hapi Sil was pitched.</p>

<p>There was sunshine here and there.</p>

<p>Towards the south the trail became more civilized and I hiked between fields and the river.</p>

<p>And passed through lovely little Swedish villages.</p>

<p>And I rewarded myself with a delicious Calzone, Goat-cheese Salad and Beer back in Umeå!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There comes a point in a climbers life where she or he no longer wants to loan a friends quick-draws. What kind of ‘draws they want often depends on their preferred style of climbing: Do they like to sports climb, climb indoors at the gym, go to the mountains or even climb ice in winter? I settled for the DMM Alpha Light QuickDraw - why you will find out in my review.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30759771542/in/album-72157666107618724/" title="What a great route"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5530/30759771542_0ee1818991_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="What a great route" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30839809236/in/album-72157666107618724/" title="Pillar of the Rain, 2nd Pitch"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5687/30839809236_19d2e9ca76_z.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Pillar of the Rain, 2nd Pitch" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Already a couple of years ago two Trad Sets of <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/dmm-alpha-light-qd-express-set/?pid=10239">DMM Alpha Light QDs</a> and one set of <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/dmm-alpha-trad-qd-express-set/?pid=10239">DMM Alpha Trad QDs</a> arrived at Hiking in Finland HQ and since then have been used mountaineering in the Alps, rock and trad climbing in Greece &amp; Norway, ice climbing in Finland and I also have clipped some gym routes with them.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36386357403/in/dateposted/" title="DMM Alpha Light Quickdraw in winter"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4418/36386357403_104c41a601_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DMM Alpha Light Quickdraw in winter" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36386356803/in/dateposted/" title="Leading and unclipping on the way down!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4359/36386356803_7d3d25cf15_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Leading and unclipping on the way down!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The reason I went for the DMM Quickdraws - also the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/petzl-ange-finesse-express-set/">Ange Finesse QD from Petzl</a> was being considered - was that they were for me the best all-round solution which works well in all the arts of climbing which I like to practice, and they were the lightest ones, too. The Alpha Light Quickdraws are made up of a full-size carabiner and a Dyneema sling and weigh 65 g  for the 12 cm ‘draw, 68 g  for the 18 cm length quickdraw and only 71 g  for the 25 cm long QD. This light weight is achieved thanks to DMM’s I-beam construction, which is very durable with high breaking loads but at the same time allows to shave weight. Once you add that shaved weight up to a full set of QDs which can be anywhere between 8 and 15 draws you can easily safe some 100 g or more. This might seem like not a lot, but remember: When you’re climbing up you have to carry all the weight up, and the lighter the gear on your harness the easier the climbing is.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37200591855/in/dateposted/" title="Three lengths"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4344/37200591855_72beed6084_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Three lengths" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37058399041/in/dateposted/" title="DMM Alpha Light on the Botom, DMM Alpha Trad on top"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4394/37058399041_73203f81e0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DMM Alpha Light on the Botom, DMM Alpha Trad on top" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So besides being the lightest draws available it also is important that they’re easy to use. As the Alpha Light and the Alpha Trad are full-size Quickdraws they lie very good in the hand and are easy to clip - on both ends. The large gate opening makes for easy clipping to the bolt, ice screw, cam or nut, and likewise makes clipping the rope very easy - also with gloves on in winter. The grooved pattern at the back of the draw makes them easy to handle, no matter if you’re climbing in warm Greek temperatures or at Korouoma in Finland in winter. The wire-gate construction is less likely to accidentally open and the clean nose profile again makes for easier clipping with less snagging. Finally, the deep rope basket with a 8,5 mm rope radius treats your rope well and lets it run through the draw smoothly. The final reason for me to get the DMM ‘draws was that they are Made in Wales, which I find in times of globalisation a nice thing to do.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37200595405/in/dateposted/" title="Grooved pattern on the back"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4359/37200595405_10710cd4ee_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Grooved pattern on the back" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37058402071/in/dateposted/" title="Lies good in my hand"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4391/37058402071_e04439322d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lies good in my hand" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that I have used these two different draws - and the differences are minimal, with the Alpha Light being slightly lighter and the Alpha Trad being minimally bigger - ice climbing in Finland, rock climbing in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/11/meteora-greece.html">Meteora, Greece</a> and Norway, mountaineering in the Alps and always was very happy with their performance. The different lengths in the Sets make them especially for trad climbing and mountaineering very versatile, while the light weight and normal carabiner size make them for sports climbing a very good choice. If you climb only hard sports routes you’re probably better off with a sports climbing specific ‘draw which you can easier grab by the sling, but for all-around use on rock, ice and in the mountains I can not imagine a better quick-draw. If you like to keep your climbing varied and want the lightest full-size quickdraw on the market, look no further than these fine ‘draws from DMM!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Bad News: The best helmet for climbing &amp; mountaineering got heavier (<em>but only 5 g</em>). The good News: The Sirocco 2.0 is more protective, has a slimmer profile and is still the best helmet on the market.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36327361374/in/dateposted/" title="The Petzl Sirocco 2.0"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4346/36327361374_b121450782_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Petzl Sirocco 2.0" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If you have bought your <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/petzl-sirocco-helmet.html">Petzl Sirocco</a> helmet after you have read my review 3,5 years ago you now have a dilemma: The Sirocco helmet has a lifetime of 10 years including a 3-year guarantee against any material or manufacturing defects. That means if you hadn’t had a major fall or hit your head really hard against a rock or ice wall you’re good to use your orange Sirocco helmet for a while still. On the other hand, if you love your orange Sirocco but are more a Ninja-Black kind of colour person, then maybe that’s the only excuse  you need to treat yourself to the Sirocco 2.0 =) Right now the Sirocco 2.0 is available in black with the orange top, but in 2018 it also will be available in white with the orange top - so if you’re more a Samurai-White kind of guy, wait a few months still!</p>

<p>I received the <a href="https://www.petzl.com/INT/en/Sport/Helmets/SIROCCO">new Sirocco helmet</a> at OutDoor from Petzl and had it out climbing and mountaineering in Norway last week, and can tell you: It’s a beauty that is so light that you still can wear it the whole day without noticing it, just like the old Sirocco. At 170 g in Size M/L for large heads it’s still super light, but thanks to the new hybrid construction (The shell is made from EPP (expanded polypropylene) foam and on top there’s a rigid crown injected with EPS (expanded polystyrene) foam) it sits lower on your head. This results in two things: It protects the back of your head better <em>and</em> you look less like you’re having an egg head. Lets have a Side-By-Side look at the old and new Sirocco to see the differences:</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37165031075/in/dateposted/" title="The Siroccos - Sides"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4415/37165031075_f5575b09ac_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="The Siroccos - Sides" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The new ventilation opening design is immediately apparent. I never got hot or cold with the old one, and also the new design seems to do its job just perfectly.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36993647532/in/dateposted/" title="The Siroccos - Back"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4409/36993647532_89a1e52fca_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="The Siroccos - Back" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At the back you see that the attachment for the headlamp has changed, the elastic for attaching your headlamp now is a wee bit bigger which makes it easier to attach your headlamp to the helmet.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36993646432/in/dateposted/" title="The Siroccos - Front"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4428/36993646432_ca73d50303_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="The Siroccos - Front" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At the front and top you see the new design especially well, with the new ventilation openings in the front and the polycarbonate crown on top which should protect even better against rocks and ice from above, and also allows the helmet to sit lower on your head.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36993643772/in/dateposted/" title="The Siroccos - Inside"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4401/36993643772_67bd486530_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="The Siroccos - Inside" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The inside also has changed a wee bit, but happily Petzl kept the adjustable headband and chinstrap which I always found fantastic - they’re very easy to adjust, also with gloves on, and I can wear the Sirocco with a thick beanie or just directly, having it adjusted in seconds. Also the great magnetic buckle stayed, which makes opening and closing the helmet with one hand super easy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36974360006/in/dateposted/" title="Fits under a hood"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4361/36974360006_994e76c9b2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Fits under a hood" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The new construction also allows it to be much more easily be worn under a hood - and the Hood on my Houdini Aegis jacket isn’t super-large, so that’s very welcome.</p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that I love the new Sirocco and am very pleased that Petzl updated the helmet in a meaningful way. The new Ventilation Opening did an outstanding job in Norway on the warm &amp; humid days I had it out, and while I wasn’t able to test its protective capabilities I am very sure that the helmet won’t disappoint me when I’m out ice and rock climbing or mountaineering and doing Via Ferratas in the Alps. If the old Siroccos fitted you well and you need a new helmet - the Sirocco 2.0 is a worthy update. And if you’re in the market for a new helmet - try the Sirocco on before you buy to see if it fits. Because a helmet that doesn’t fit and hence doesn’t get worn simply isn’t smart.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36974358926/in/dateposted/" title="Great view &amp; a great helmet"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4349/36974358926_66e3d9e3b6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Great view &amp; a great helmet" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>“We’re not gonna dress her up in pink clothes”</em> was what my wife and me agreed on when our daughter was born about two years ago. And for one and half years we re-used her big brothers clothes through all seasons. But then came spring and it became clear that we won’t be able to hold on to that idea - because our daughter loves pink <em>and</em> she didn’t fit the clothes we had. And so a pair of pink shoes, a pink beanie and a pink overall arrived from Reima, and we haven’t looked back since.</p>

<p><em>Välikausivaatteet</em> is Finnish for <em>In-between seasons garments</em> and refers to garments for the very brief but vibrant spring (those two weeks where everything bursts out green plus those many weeks or months of grey &amp; brown) and the colourful autumn. To be honest, though - the summer in Finland was for the third year in a row so wet, grey and just not summer-y that you could wear these <em>Välikausivaatteet</em> from May till when winter comes (thanks to climate change that likely is again January or February). Anyway, what makes these garments - and lets focus for a moment especially on the <a href="https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1173541864&amp;as=1179503632&amp;t=2&amp;tk=1&amp;url=https://www.reima.com/fi//Reimatec%C2%AE--v%C3%A4likausihaalari-Nauru/p/510255C-4621-080">Reimatec Nauru Overall</a> - special is that they are less warm than winter clothes but still keep especially wind and rain at bay. The Nauru Overall is very waterproof and fairly breathable, the diagonal zipper makes it easy to put on and the hood can be removed when not needed. We picked it because it is pink, but not straight-out-Barbie Pink but a nice block print with different shades of pink - something that parents that are slightly opposed to this colour still can accept. Our daughter didn’t share this colour aversion and as the Nauru Overall arrived it was the best thing ever, something that she’d pull off the wardrobe and put on as soon as just the word “outside” was spoken! She really loves this overall, and it has been very good on all her little adventures so far - be it playing on the playground, strolling through the forest and picking bilberries or sitting in the Thule Chariot when we ride around town. The suit is also spacious enough that she can wear a fleece or wool overall underneath it when it gets a bit colder, and it has a great freedom of movement that allows her to climb, slide and run. She’s been now wearing it since five months and in that time it has been several times in the laundry, but it still looks great and with some luck she still will fit it when the next in-between-season arrived in 2018.</p>

<p>As we needed some new shoes for her too, we decided to go pink all the way and ordered the <a href="https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1173541864&amp;as=1179503632&amp;t=2&amp;tk=1&amp;url=https://www.reima.com/fi/Taaperot/Keng%C3%A4t/Tennarit-ja-lenkkarit/Lasten-lenkkarit-Knappe/p/569300-4620-021">Knappe Shoes</a>. These have Velcro closures which she can open herself, and while she can not yet put the shoes on she can take them off when we come home. They have good grip on wet forest trails with roots and rocks, and also are fine to climb on boulders and at the playground. As it has been quite a bit rainy over here the shoes have kept her little feet dry and warm.</p>

<p>And to complete the pink outfit we got the the <a href="https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1173541864&amp;as=1179503632&amp;t=2&amp;tk=1&amp;url=https://www.reima.com/fi//Lasten-pipo-Linna/p/518397-3728-050">Linna Beanie</a> (currently 50% off!). It’s made of Polyester, Elastane and Cotton in two layers, which means it’s too hot even for a Finnish Summer, but as I highlighted already in the beginning: There was not much of a warm summer here either way! It’s a cute little beanie that she likes to wear (beanies she doesn’t like to wear she takes off!) and it keeps her head warm and her hence in a good mood =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36972723266/in/dateposted/" title="Reima Kids Shoes Knappe"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4408/36972723266_785422e381_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Reima Kids Shoes Knappe" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36990782262/in/dateposted/" title="Crawling"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4439/36990782262_81b1f3b7f5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Crawling" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that we have crossed into the segment of parents who dress their kids up in pink. It’s a rather large segment here in Finland (99% big) and as it makes her happy while keeping her warm &amp; dry we parents will slowly but surely get used to the colour pink - and it isn’t as difficult if the garments are as stylish as these ones! And on the plus side: She’s easy to spot when she disappears in the forest to search for berries =)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Confused about Tarps?</em>  Don’t be: Tarps are a great way to camp out as you are closer to nature, you can see the sunrise &amp; sunset from your quilt, there’s less condensation and tarps are very light. In this article I present four tarps and useful accessories for beginners and experts alike so that on your next trip you can sleep close to nature under your tarp!</p>

<h2 id="the-best-tarp-for-beginners">The Best Tarp for Beginners</h2>

<p>At a wee bit over 70€ the <a href="http://www.ddhammocks.com/product/DD_Superlight_Tarp?from_cat=2">DD Hammocks Superlight Tarp</a>, a flat square tarp, doesn’t brake the bank and offers beginners in tarping a Tarp with which they can experiment. Use it as a Diamond pitched against a tree? No problem! As an A-Frame with your trekking poles? Voilá! As a big canopy to cook and sleep under with some friends? Of course! At a claimed weight of 460 g excluding pegs and guy lines it’s not heavy, either. If you don’t mind more weight but want something cheaper, check out the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/urberg-premium-tarp-tarp/?pid=10239">Urberg Premium Tarp</a>. These square tarps are very useful and could be all the Tarp you ever need if you stay low on your trips or are not afraid to experiment with pitching it!</p>

<h2 id="the-colourful-spinnaker-tarp">The Colourful Spinnaker Tarp</h2>

<p><a href="http://store.picharpak.com/">PicharPak Workshop</a> is a Cottage Manufacturer out of Hong Kong and it’s owner Jason makes some superb Tarps. The colourful <a href="http://store.picharpak.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=59&amp;product_id=50">DS Tarp</a> is made from Spinnaker and weighs a mere 279 g incl. the guylines and stuff sack - that’s pretty amazing! Add in that they are priced very good and this makes for the perfect tarp for anyone that wants some more colour in there outdoor life. These tarps also allow you to pitch higher in the mountains as they can be pitched with trekking poles, and you can pitch them very low so they create a nice windproof shelter. The advantage of Spinnaker is that it is light and comes in many different colours - much more than just grey! And as you usually pitch your tarp when it rains this means at least you’d be sitting under a colourful piece of fabric instead of one which has the same colours as the clouds above!</p>

<h2 id="the-triple-c-tarp">The Triple C Tarp</h2>

<p>A <strong>C</strong>atenary <strong>C</strong>ut <strong>C</strong>uben Tarp is in my experience much easier to pitch and they are also really light. Some argue that they’re less flexible than flat tarps because you only can pitch them in a limited number of setups - if these work for your trips, though, there’s nothing that speaks against them. I personally really like Cat-Cut Cuben Tarps and they work great for my trips in the forests and hills. These tarps are pretty pricey, though - that’s because cuben is an extremely expensive material and also the Cat Cut is more work-intensive than a simple square. But if you invest the $€£ then you get a great Tarp that will make you happy each time you pitch it. In this category fall the <a href="http://bit.ly/2wnOOpB">Hyperlite Mountain Gear Echo II</a> and the <a href="https://www.yamamountaingear.com/cuben-fiber-tapered-tarp-979-5CF/">Yama Mountain Gear 9’/7’ X 9’ Tapered Tarp</a>, among several others.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/p5RG45U3LAAOsiMngMnjDAaHJjYRDRV4S5g4VqcfkwU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TLAVMvWWOBI/AAAAAAAADSw/Bm3IMnCkBhM/s800/IWG_Russia_0929.JPG" height="600" width="800" /></a></p>

<h2 id="the-expert-tarp">The Expert Tarp</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://bit.ly/2vSojb9">Hyperlite Mountain Gear Square Flat Tarp</a> is the ideal choice for ultralight backpackers which have reached a Zen Master level. The versatility of this shelter is just like the Beginner Tarp, just that this Cuben Version is a lot lighter - my 8’6” x 8’6” tarp weighs 289 g including guylines! This is a lovely tarp that’s very easy to pitch in many different ways, and I find it ideal for <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/bikepacking/">bikepacking</a> as I don’t need to carry poles with me - I usually pitch it between trees or look for a death stick to use as a pole.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16908493456/in/dateposted/" title="A lightweight spring adventure by bike"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8738/16908493456_24643fdd8e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="A lightweight spring adventure by bike" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="useful-accessories">Useful Accessories</h2>

<p>Usually you won’t encounter a Tarp Enthusiast without a Bivy on the trail. Tarp + Bivy go hand-in-hand as both are ultralight, versatile in use and pack really small in your pack. I am using a <a href="https://www.wildernessthreadworks.com">Wilderness Threadworks</a> Cuben + Silnylon bevy which I love, but I equally loved my Tyvek LAUFBURSCHE Bivy. If you decide you need a bivy: Buy some <a href="https://www.extremtextil.de/en/search?sSearch=tyvek">Tyvek</a> and start sewing, a simple bivy is the easiest MYOG Project you can start with. The <a href="https://mountainlaureldesigns.com/product/mld-superlight-solo-bivy/">Mountain Laurel Designs SuperLight Bivy</a> is very light and popular, too. And the beauty of the bivy and tarp combo is of course also that you can use them on their own just like the weather dictates!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14376802441/in/album-72157644166894052/" title="Bed"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5515/14376802441_7b2115dea3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Bed" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If you like something with a bit more headspace than a bivy bag then the <a href="https://www.yamamountaingear.com/bug-shelter-1p-silpoly/">Yama Mountain Gear Bug Shelter Silpoly 1P</a> or the <a href="http://bit.ly/2vgh3RX">Hyperlite Mountain Gear Echo II Insert</a> allow you still to see the sunrise and sunset from your quilt, but without mosquitos or midges buzzing around your head. These also transform your tarp into a tent as now you have two layers of fabric between you and the outdoors - one to keep the bugs out, and one to keep you dry. Of course, just like the bivy, you can use the net shelters also on their own on pretty days where it won’t rain but the bugs are a problem.</p>

<p>You can’t pitch your Tarp without Pegs. I always carry a wide variety with me and regularly test new ones, currently I often use these <a href="https://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/equipment-c3/tents-shelters-c25/tent-accessories-c33/tent-pegs-c314/rt90-tent-pegs-p6611">Swiss Piranha</a> pegs, the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/msr-mini-groundhog-stake/?pid=10239">MSR Mini-Groundhog Stake</a>, some simple <a href="http://bit.ly/2uWRxpE">Aluminum Tent Pegs</a> with a colourful head so they’re easier to locate and some <a href="http://bit.ly/2vR84Kt">V Pegs</a> as these are pretty versatile in many different kinds of terrain. It’s best to carry just the right amount of pegs with you which you need to pitch your tarp, and use two strong pegs - like the Swiss Piranha ones - for pitching out the main guylines.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16387412024/in/dateposted/" title="20150402-_DSC9355"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8753/16387412024_5c67017d18_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="20150402-_DSC9355" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Guy lines are also something you’ll need for your tarp. There’s many different kinds and pretty much every tarp mentioned above comes with some sort of it, but the best in my opinion is a <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/exped-reflective-tentcord/?pid=10239">reflective Dyneema cord</a> as these are very strong and you can see them in the light of your headlamp at night. There’s nothing more annoying than tripping over your guylines at night when nature was calling, as then you’ll need to pitch the tarp again in the worst case. Thus: Reflective cord!</p>

<p>I’m not a fan of Ground sheets at all, I find them messy in use (as in packing them up after a wet night) and hence I don’t use them. But there’s plenty of tarp enthusiasts who use a ground sheet, and <a href="https://www.gossamergear.com/collections/tents/products/polycryo-tent-footprint-ground-cloths">Polycro</a> is very much liked for its very affordable price and SUL weight - though an <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/care-plus-emergency-blanket-first-aid-kit/?pid=10239">Emergency Blanket</a> is just a few grams heavier and can be used in an emergency as the name suggests; plus it might keep you warmer at night as it reflects heat.</p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that tarping is fun, easy, affordable and allows you to be closer to nature. Because, lets be honest: There isn’t always much sense in going out into nature and then hiding between several layers of synthetic fibres from the views (<em>there’ certainly situations where that makes complete sense, but those are probably less than 50% the case</em>). Sleeping outside should mean you sleep close to nature, and with a tarp and Bivy there’s very little which seperates you from it - try it out sometime!</p>

<p><strong>That’s it!</strong> Yes, there’s other Tarps out there which might/ could/ should have been in this article - <strong>let me know what I missed in the comments</strong>, as well as Tarp Tips you might have!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On recent trips I haven’t worn trailrunning shoes. That’s because I switched to the La Sportiva TX2, an ultralight approach shoe which I found great for backpacking, scrambling &amp; Via Ferratas. Read my review to see if you should switch to them too &amp; how they fare in the snow.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36434504366/in/dateposted/" title="La Sportiva TX2 Meets Fox"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4400/36434504366_fe80aa6ce6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="La Sportiva TX2 Meets Fox" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>La Sportiva provided me last year with the TX2 for free to take them to the Dolomites. Additionally, since the beginning of 2017 I’m sponsored by La Sportiva.

Read the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/about/">Transparency Disclaimer</a> for more information on affiliate links &amp; blogger transparency.</em></p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I received the TX2 last year in late September, just in time for my backing trip to the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/autumn-backpacking-in-the-dolomites.html">Dolomites</a>. I have used them on several hiking and climbing trips since, and they’re also my city shoes of choice at the moment. All in all I have hiked, approached mountains, cycled and walked around town several hundred kilometres in them.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30317861721/in/album-72157675269849996/" title="La Sportiva TX2"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8550/30317861721_e7048769ff_z.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="La Sportiva TX2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The TX2 is the lightest approach shoe La Sportiva makes. It’s main purpose is to take you into the mountains to the start of your climb, where they can be banded together and you can clip them to your harness while you climb your objective, so that at the summit you can slip back into them and walk back down (or rappel, which is more comfortable than rappelling in climbing shoes). I have found them also great for Via Ferratas and backpacking, as they’re very grippy and allow me to scramble securely.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The TX2 packs these features:</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>I haven’t seen something like the C2™ ComboCord around the heel of the shoe, which allows you to wrap them together and clip them to your harness. It’s what has drawn me to the TX2 initially and is a cool little feature for climbers, but backpackers probably won’t make much use of it - unless you carry a second pair of shoes (maybe some <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a>?!) in which case you might find it useful to pack them small together.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>As I wrote above, I have used this show for almost a year in autumn, winter, spring and summer on the limestone of the Dolomites, Finnish granite, snow &amp; asphalt and wooden trails and have never found anything wrong with them. They’re always comfortable for my feet with a good fit in the heel, and the toe box is wide enough to accommodate my toes.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>I’m wearing a Size 42 TX2 and in that size it weighs 283 g per shoe, or 566 g for the pair.</p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>Since 2003 La Sportiva has been using the ISO 14.001 Environmental Management System (in conjunction with the ISO 9.001 Quality Standard, like any smart company!). In 2010 they made investments to make the production and working environment better, and in 2016 Lorenzo Delladio, the president and CEO of La Sportiva, was awarded the honour of “Knight of the National Order of Merit” for conducting the family business with an eco-sustainable approach that is aware of the company’s social responsibilities towards the environment. That’s about all the infos I found on their <a href="http://www.lasportiva.com/en/company">website</a>, as well as that there’s some Vegan shoes and garments available from La Sportiva, but sadly there’s no further information on how you should recycle your shoes or apparel when they’re worn out.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>As always, this is the most important part of the whole article - get a cup of coffee and then read on.</p>

<p>As I asked La Sportiva if they’d like to send me a pair of TX2 for taking them to the Dolomites it was a nice surprise that a week later they were with me and I could test them already a bit on my local trails before flying south to the Alps. The TX2 is light - really light for an approach shoe, which can easily weigh double as much as these. That lightness also means they’re very breathable - which is great in warm weather (but I still got warm feet in the jungles of Mexico) - but can get a bit fresh if you happen into snow on your hike. Nevertheless, with some good Merino socks that was also not a problem, and I was happy to descend a steep and snowy mountain in them. The upper dries pretty fast, after descending a snowy pass and continuing the hike it was about an hour later that shoes and socks were dry again. The shoe has a wee toe bumper which means impacts from the front or kicking steps into soft-ish ice and snow are nor problem, but it’s very short. The thinly padded tongue is stitched to the upper from the middle down which keeps it centred and is an elegant solution the tongue hanging out to one side or the other.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35645210724/in/photostream/" title="Ran that snowy pass down in the La Sportiva TX2 &#x3D;)"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4370/35645210724_0395622014_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ran that snowy pass down in the La Sportiva TX2 &#x3D;)" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I like the Vibram Mega-Grip Traverse-Lite sole of the shoes, these do have an exceptional great grip on wet rocks of all kind. The lugs aren’t very deep (common design in approach shoes) so wet, grassy slopes and very muddy trails need to be navigated carefully, but with the right technique that’s not a problem either. The climbing zone at the front allows you to scramble &amp; climb easier grades (this postulates that you have the skills), and that’s also what makes these shoes pretty good for Via Ferratas. The sole is pretty soft which I like too - stiff shoes are not good for me unless the activity really demands it (ice climbing). These shoes edge well, which means small foot holds - think a one centimetre or less - are for me easy to place my feet on and stick it. I routinely go “bouldering” with these shoes when I’m out with the kids, and they are great for that.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the fit. I can move and splay my toes in the shoe in my normal hiking lacing up, but if you’re serious about the scrambling and climbing you can lace the shoe up very tightly for a better feel. It’s a pretty low volume so very thick socks are not recommended. The construction, in conjunction with the lacing makes the shoe wrap around my foot like a comfortable glove. I can jam my foot into a crack when climbing and know the shoe and my foot will stay put. The heel again is very good for my foot, even if laced loosely it has a secure fit and the microfleece-like lining is soft &amp; comfortable. The shoe has a 4 mm Ortholite Approach which I find a good match, I generally don’t like shoes with much drop and these are right there where I like it.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I could say that they could be lighter, but I fear that make them less durable, so all in all there really isn’t anything that I can think of that could make them better.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>I have used quite a few pairs of approach shoes, and while some where good - like the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/05/arcteryx-acrux2-fl-gtx.html">Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX</a> - <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/salewa-wildfire-approach-shoes.html">others</a> I didn’t like that much. <a href="http://www.lasportiva.com/en/approach-footwear">La Sportiva</a> themselves also offer a variety of approach shoes, and the TX2 is just the start.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36516686256/in/dateposted/" title="Hi there deeeeeeeep cave!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4340/36516686256_a75c73fbd0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hi there deeeeeeeep cave!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>Overall I really like the La Sportiva TX2 and that’s not just because La Sportiva sponsors me. It’s a lightweight shoe which works for me in many different situations, from every day cycling and walking to backpacking and Via Ferratas in the mountains. I keep them laced up and just slip in and just lace them tighter when it gets more vertical. Despite the lightweight construction the shoe has held up very well thus far and almost daily use for 6 to 8 months hasn’t make them look worse - I believe I’ll be using these still next year in the autumn! Which brings me back to the question from the start: Should you switch from trailrunning shoes to these? If you use trailrunning shoes only for hiking &amp; backpacking and not for actual trailrunning then I think you should give these definitely a try. At 566 g a pair in Size 42 they are as light as many trailrunning shoes and share many of the properties which you like from them: Breathability, grip and flexibility. They add packability and the climbing sole means you can navigate scrambles on your hikes more securely, which for mountain treks is a useful benefit. I’m very happy with my switch and don’t think that I’ll move back for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Flat tires on 29” wheels, they where common for me back with my old 29er. Happily I started to drive more careful and punctures have been rare in the last several years, but as I welcomed the Trek 920 Disc to the family I decided I wanted to ride it Tubeless. There where some good reasons for that:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>You can save weight.</strong> I’m still a ultralight backpacker at heart and if there’s a possibility to save weight then I’ll take it.</li>
  <li><strong>Adiós, Punctures!</strong> Don’t like that sound of your inner tube going flat? I hate it, and with a healthy dose of your Latex liquid in your tube that sound is unlikely to reach your ears again.</li>
  <li><strong>Traction, baby!</strong> Less pressure on the tires means you have more traction - pretty useful in sharp curves and lose trails.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, with three good reasons to get rid of inner tubes I set out on a sunny afternoon to convert my 920 Disc to Tubeless. It isn’t a quick operation by all means so make sure you have a couple of hours of peace to go about this. Here’s what you’ll need:</p>

<p>Alright, with all your tools and gear ready it’s time to start.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Preparation is KEY! Your Tire Booster needs to be “primed” first, so take your floor pump and put some 11 bars of air in it - that way you don’t need to do it later. Also, a good thing to do is to unfold your tire - if you’re using a tire that comes folded like I did - before you start the whole operation - and hang it into the sun. It will warm up and get a tiny, tiny bit more flexible which makes it easier to put on the rim later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lets first check if your rim is Tubeless-Ready. If it is it should be written on it somewhere - either it reads <em>Tubeless Ready</em> or <em>“TLR”</em> somewhere. If they are: Great, that saved you several hundred Euros for new Rims!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36269911182/in/dateposted/" title="Is the Rim Tubeless Ready?"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4437/36269911182_390912e928_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Is the Rim Tubeless Ready?" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<ol>
  <li>Time to deflate the tube, remove tire + tube + old rim tape, and get cleaning. Take a soapy rag and clean the inside (and while you’re at it, also the outside) of the rim, remove all dirt &amp; dust and then dry it well off. That’s because the next step is quite crucial for the success of the whole operation, and if you hurry through this you might do it twice, so calm and relaxed proceed you shall. Now you grab the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/schwalbe-tubeless-felgenband-fahrradreifen/?pid=10239">Tubeless Rim Tape</a> (these are available in different widths, make sure to buy the one which works best for your rim!) and apply careful and precisely the tape to the inside of the rim. Start opposite of the hole where the valve will go through later, and apply it carefully and cleanly with a lot of pressure to the rim, and avoid air bubbles. I say it again: <em>This is a very important step, so don’t hurry and take your time.</em> If you’ve gone once around and reach the start go another 5 to 10 cm and then cut the tape. Now take the Tubeless Valve from the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/schwalbe-tubeless-easy-kit-23-fahrradreifen/?pid=10239">Tubeless Easy Kit</a> and put it through the rim tape where it belong. Make sure to screw it tightly onto the rim, as the area around the valve can be a point where air easily escapes.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Time to take your <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/schwalbe-thunder-burt-tl-easy-29er-psc-snakeskin-faltbar/?pid=10239">Tubeless Tire</a> and mount it carefully onto the rim. If you can don’t use the tire lever as it might damage the rim tape - if you had your unfolded tire hang in the sun this should be possible. Make sure that the tire’s beads are on each side of the valve before you head on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time to inflate! Apply a generous coating of the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/schwalbe-montagefluid-easy-fit-bike-tires/?pid=10239">Easy Fit</a> assembly liquid to both sides of the tire beads, the (clean!) soapy water would work too. For the first inflation a powerful burst of air is needed so take the Tire Booster (or if you have one, the compressor) and attach it to the valve. It makes sense to take the top of the valve off to allow more air through-flow, you get a wee tool for that in the Tubeless Easy Kit. Alrighty, this is the moment of truth: Open the Tire Booster and see how your Tubeless Tire inflates. It should set with several loud <strong>BANG!</strong> sounds onto the rim, only if you hear that you know everything went as planned. You need to check the line on the tire to control if the complete tire is correctly mounted, if not knead and push the tire to get it into the right position.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36042172070/in/dateposted/" title="Easy Fit!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4401/36042172070_5cb9d07278_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Easy Fit!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36269910952/in/dateposted/" title="Tire Booster in action"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4381/36269910952_d1dbe91ae1_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="Tire Booster in action" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This can be a stressful moment if you don’t hear that loud bang which indicates that the tire beads have engaged the rim - I tried for over an hour to get it to set down. The thing is that 29” tires (and Fatbike Tires even more so) take a lot of air to fill and that in my case the Tire Booster didn’t have enough power to engage the complete tire - it didn’t set down on a couple of places which means that the air was escaping and I couldn’t move on. The solution is to empty the whole Tire Booster into the Tire to get the Tire to set down on as many places on the rim as possible, and then switch to the Floor Pump and keep on inflating the tire. This did the trick for me - the tire looked almost like it was going to burst but in the end I heard the several loud bangs which meant the tire was now fully engaged to the rim. Success, at last!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Now that the tire sits on the rim you can take the pump/ compressor/ Tire Booster off the valve. This will deflate the tire a wee bit, but that’s not a problem. Remove the valve insert if you haven’t done that already in the previous step and take a bottle of the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/schwalbe-doc-blue-professional-inner-tube/?pid=10239">Doc Blue puncture protection liquid</a> - now it’s time to put it into your Tire and make it Tubeless! You can easily fill the bottle through the valve into the tire - for 29” tires you use the whole 60 ml, smaller tires need less. Once the bottle is empty you put the valve insert back, take the floor pump and inflate the tire again - around 2 bar for these 29” tires is good for starters. Remove the pump, close the valve and now you’ll need to roll and shake the tire for quite a bit - the goal is to distribute the puncture protection liquid everywhere in the tire so that an even cover covers it from the inside. To check the tire once more for leaks you can cover the outside of the tire along the rim with your soapy water - there where there’s bubbles building up you need to move the puncture protection liquid on the inside to cover it better.</li>
</ol>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35630506573/in/dateposted/" title="Doc Blue goes in!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4372/35630506573_cb13980646_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Doc Blue goes in!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>If the tire now stays inflated you can attach it back to the bike and get started on the second wheel, after which you should head out for a test ride. All good? Then pack up your bike and head out on a bikepacking Microadventure - Tubeless Edition!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36269915742/in/dateposted/" title="Schwalbe Thunder Burt Tubeless"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4370/36269915742_7e1a2ca31b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Schwalbe Thunder Burt Tubeless" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I’m now riding since over a month Tubeless and love it. I can ride my tires with less pressure on the trails which equals better traction, but of course the biggest benefit for me is that I don’t need to worry about punctures and snake bites anymore, as the puncture protection liquid seals those immediately should they happen. It’s just a great feeling to know that you can ride how you want without needing to worry that you might end up with a flat tire! Finally, if you’re a friend of moving pictures then have a look at <a href="https://youtu.be/M2fVuTqicCc">this video</a> which is by and far the best on how to convert your tires to tubeless tires! More Information on Tubeless you can find on the <a href="https://www.schwalbe.com/en/tubeless-technology.html">Schwalbe Tubeless</a> Website, while the <a href="https://www.schwalbe.com/en/tubeless.html">Tubeless FAQ</a> can answer additional questions you might have.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36117927172/in/dateposted/" title="New Piezo Ignition in place"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4307/36117927172_025c2059ba_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="New Piezo Ignition in place" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I like my <a href="http://bit.ly/2vaSwlw">Primus Lite+</a>. It ain’t the lightest stove I own, but it is very convenient to use. Too bad just that the Piezo Ignition of it broke on a recent camping trip :/ Primus was friendly enough to supply me a <a href="http://www.primus.eu/catalogsearch/result/?q=Piezo+igniter+lite%2B">new Piezo Ignition</a> and as I had a wee bit of free time I made a short video of me repairing it. Make sure to click on quality and choose 4K to see it in all its glory:</p>

<p>As you see, it’s pretty easy and straight-forward. I don’t own a small screw driver, but I had a small bit which fitted just fine. My pliers are from my modelling hobby, I reckon if you don’t have pliers even a strong pair of scissors would do the job. Then just put everything back together, bend the cable from the Piezo Igniter slightly back down to the stove head and <strong>Boom!</strong> - your Piezo Ignition is fixed and ready to ignite your stove again. All in all it took maybe five minutes, so an easy task.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the second Episode of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/how-does-it-taste/">How Does It Taste?</a> I test again a Vegan meal, this time LYO Food’s Barley-Lentils-Risotto with Avocado Mousse.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35737991450/in/dateposted/" title="LYO Food Barley-Lentils-Risotto with Avocado Mousse"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4310/35737991450_f7053654aa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="LYO Food Barley-Lentils-Risotto with Avocado Mousse" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>One can’t eat enough healthy food. Sure, we all might fantasize after several days on the trail about Pizza or Hamburgers, but when you arrive at your camping spot or the belay ledge half-way through the wall what your body really need is a tasty &amp; healthy portion of food. And the Barley-Lentils-Risotto with Avocado Mousse from LYO Food is exactly that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EB2p6nyQx5M">Watch the video</a> to see how this vegan meal tastes:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EB2p6nyQx5M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><strong>In short:</strong> This is the most tasty vegan backpacking meal I have tried yet. Excellently spiced with a nice crunch from the barley and lentils this is a meal I could always eat anywhere and if you’d served it to me on a plate in a Restaurant I wouldn’t doubt that a Chef would have made it in the kitchen for me. The only downside I can think of is that it packs only 433 kcal for the 110 g pouch which might be to little after a hard day outdoors, but other than that I find this an excellent meal. If you’re now curious about the Barley-Lentils-Risotto with Avocado Mousse you can buy it directly from <a href="https://lyofood.com/collections/main-meals/products/barley-lentils-risotto-with-avocado-mousse">LYO Food</a> or at the <a href="https://www.outdoorfoodshop.de/de/vegane-outdoornahrung/193-graupen-linsen-risotto-avocado-lyofood-5902768107647.html">Outdoor Food Shop</a>.</p>
