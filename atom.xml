<p>I own more shoes than my wife. I blame the multitude of activities I partake in for the amount of shoes in my closet, as well as my desire to try out new technologies. In this article are all but one pair of shoes which I have used in the last 16 months - the notable absence are the <a href="https://bit.ly/2BFopb7">‚àû Luna Sandals OSO Flaco</a> which are my much-loved summer sandals, which I will review at a later point. Many of the shoes in this article are made for specific activities but I tend to use all shoes at a minimum for hiking and some every-day use. Anyway, let‚Äôs jump in!</p>

<h2 id="la-sportiva-trango-ice-cube-gtx">La Sportiva Trango Ice Cube GTX</h2>

<p><strong>Weight</strong>: One Boot 697 g, Pair 1397 g // <strong>Size</strong>: 42 // <strong>Buy them</strong> at <a href="https://bit.ly/2PxQF61">‚àû La Sportiva</a>, <a href="https://tidd.ly/3sByUl4">‚àû Bergzeit</a> (currently 12% off), <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/la-sportiva-trango-ice-cube-gtx-mountaineering-boots/?pid=10239">‚àû Bergfreunde</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/3u3LCJz">‚àû Backcountry</a> or find the best deals on <a href="https://www.outdoordeals.com">Outdoordeals.com</a>!</p>

<p>The La Sportiva Trango Ice Cube GTX are my ice climbing boots (which means they are fully crampon compatible!) - but as I climb less ice nowadays (simply less time) I have used these boots for the most part as winter hiking boots. For many years I have tried to get away in winter with using trailrunning shoes, but as soon as some snow is involved low shoes fill up with snow, which equals wet socks, which means cold feet. I am not fond of cold &amp; wet feet, and hence the La Sportiva Trango Ice Cube GTX come since two years on every time I go into the snow in winter - these are mid-high boots with a super nice integrated gaiter, which closes around my leg and hence there‚Äôs no snow coming inside the boot or socks!</p>

<p>Another problem of trailrunning shoes is that I mostly use unlined shoes, and that means the wind goes through - and again cold feet are the result. The Trango Ice Cube GTX have an upper which is made in a seamless construction method and have an Gore-Tex Insulated Comfort lining that keeps my feet toasty and warm, even at <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/03/fatbiking-in-saariselka.html">-25¬∞C in Lapland</a>. I have used these boots for hiking, cycling, skiing with OAC Skinbased skis and also ice-climbing and mountaineering, as well as pottering around in the snow. I like that they are relatively lightweight, the high gaiter is ideal for my kind of activities and keeps the snow out, and they are toasty warm when moving around in the cold. If you need a warm pair of winter boots which you also can take climbing in the mountains, then I can strongly recommend the La Sportiva Trango Ice Cube GTX!</p>

<h2 id="on-cloudventure-peak">ON Cloudventure Peak</h2>

<p><strong>Weight</strong>: One Shoe 254 g, Pair 506 g // <strong>Size</strong>: 42 // <strong>Buy them</strong> at <a href="https://bit.ly/3fp72wC">‚àû ON Running</a>, <a href="https://tidd.ly/3fn2rLn">‚àû Bergzeit</a>, <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/on-cloudventure-peak-trail-running-shoes-bf/?pid=10239">‚àû Bergfreunde</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/3u5Pzxw">‚àû Backcountry</a> or find the best deals on <a href="https://www.outdoordeals.com">Outdoordeals.com</a>!</p>

<p>I have been trailrunning in these shoes for over two years now (switching around with other shoes!) and really like them. They have a wide-ish toe box, a good fit in the heel cup, a very thin tongue which make these shoes almost feel like a sock and the sole gives great grip on all sorts of surfaces: Mud, granite rocks and trails full of roots. On asphalt sections and hard gravel roads they weren‚Äôt perfect - the ‚ÄúClouds‚Äù as these open sections of the sole are called do have good cushioning on trails, but on roads I find them less good - and as they are not made for road running, I only use them on the short sections to get to the trail. But yeah, the sock-like fit, together with the thin, breathable upper, make this a great shoe for running in the summer. The laces are really good, too - a tad long, but they stayed closed, even on long runs. And the sole has good grip and cushioning as mentioned already. But do the Zero-Gravity heel Clouds provide softer landings, as they claim? I can not agree nor disagree with it to be honest. Does that make them less good? Hell no! I‚Äôm always happy to go running in these shoes - and they fit well in with my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning outfit</a>, too!</p>

<p>I received these in January 2020 and they have become my Every-day use shoes after the snow is gone and before it gets really warm (as then I prefer to wear Sandals). Besides walking to the Kindergarden and along the coast I also use them for easy day hikes, cycling and scrambling =) These are Black Diamond‚Äôs first entry into the Footwear market, and after using them for over a year I think they have done a good job. The sock-like fit is great: It‚Äôs easy to slip into the shoes for example, and if you have them on there‚Äôs nothing rubbing you the wrong way, so they are really comfortable. The upper is made from one piece and claimed to be very breathable, which is true to a certain temperature - at temperatures over 20¬∞C I do get sweaty feet in them. The rubber sole is really excellent on rock and it‚Äôs nice to scramble up the big rocks which the last Ice Age left here in Vaasa - precise placements are no problem. The sole is also surprisingly durable for all the asphalt walking I have done in them over the past year, which is very positive. Overall a really lightweight and grippy shoe, which I use with pleasure - I hope to test them in the mountains soon, approaching some climbs!</p>

<p>I bought these shoes last year and used them on my backpacking &amp; packrafting trip in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/lemmenjoki-national-park.html">Lemmenjoki National Park</a>, and was a bit disappointed that the toe cap came lose after just 60 km of hiking. Also the Graphene rubber sole, which is claimed to be more durable, has not lived up to the hype in my opinion - but then maybe I hiked too much over very hard granite rocks for long stretches, which is a very taxing underground on all soles - especially if I consider that these Mudclaw shoes are made for muddy and wet trails. In those conditions they have been very good, giving great grip with their deep lugs in the mud, and no chance of slipping. I love the close feel to the ground in these shoes, and they have been comfortable even on 40 km days across the wilderness of Lapland. The overall durability is a bit of a let-down though, as I expected more from the Graphene soles - maybe I have to pick up the <a href="https://tidd.ly/39nPT2K">‚àû Roclite G 275</a> and see if it is lasting longer on hard rock surfaces. For the time being, I‚Äôll continue to go running and hiking in these Mudclaw G 260 though.</p>

<p>After years of not using any <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/salomon-speedcross-3.html">Salomon Speecross Shoes</a> I got these S-Lab Speedcross shoes three years ago - and damn, are they good! As <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">I wrote in 2018</a>: These S-Lab shoes are light, have great grip, are comfortable and have ‚Äúno ankle support‚Äù. But after running in them for 2+ years I can report I haven‚Äôt had any problems running in them and the lack of ‚Äúankle support‚Äù is not an issue for me. I still don‚Äôt like that the pocket for the laces is designed badly (newer Salomon shoes do that much better!), but other than that these are great Speedcross shoes which convince with great grip, fit and comfort also on long runs. I expect these will continue to be good for a year or two, as I pretty much only use them for running or the occasional hike so the durability of the sole has been very good.</p>

<p>I bought these in February 2020 as I am fed-up with the super slippery roads we have in winter in Vaasa, and after I fell on my buttocks a few times over the past years I decided enough is enough. These are trailrunning shoes with spikes, and have no lining - which also makes them somewhat ‚Äúcold‚Äù in really cold weather. But the main reason these shoes are brilliant are the 16 studs which ensure bomb-proof grip on even the smoothest of ice! That grip is absolutely fantastic and I haven‚Äôt felt insecure on icey roads even once this winter! The bluesign upper is smooth, pretty durable and also water repellent but not waterproof - I have gotten moist feet when using them in deeper snow, so I try to stay clear of that. The sock-like fit is very comfortable and also on runs these have performed very good, ensuring I can continue to run in even the most slippery conditions. Overall a great shoe that ensures I stay upright even on mirror-like ice roads and trails!</p>

<h2 id="tecnica-plasma-s">Tecnica Plasma S</h2>

<p><strong>Weight</strong>: One Shoe 423 g, Pair 884 g // <strong>Size</strong>: 42 // <strong>Get a pair</strong> at <a href="https://www.blizzard-tecnica.com/us/en/men/hiking/shoes/plasma-s">Tecnica</a> or find the best deals on <a href="https://www.outdoordeals.com">Outdoordeals.com</a>!</p>

<p>These shoes I got as a Test sample on the last #OutDoorFN fair in Friedrichshafen, and have used them on-and-off over the past three years. The footbed and upper are fully customized to my feet for a personalized and unique fit, as much like a ski boot these shoes can be moulded to your feet. And yes, these are comfortable shoes, which I have used hiking, cycling and walking around in town. The Vibram Megagrip sole is great on wet and dry trails alike, but the black mesh upper does tend to get dirty and it‚Äôs not that easy to clean. The shoe is also pretty warm and nothing I can use in the summer, but for right now and these wet, cold and ice-free seasons I find them really good. However, it‚Äôs also a ‚Äúheavy‚Äù shoe and it stands quite high above the ground - something I had to get used to, as I prefer to use shoes with a low or Zero Drop which allow me to be close to the ground. But even if they aren‚Äôt the shoes I‚Äôd use on long hikes, I do think that these are good shoes, especially for people who want a perfect fit, great grip and don‚Äôt mind the higher weight.</p>

<p>And that are all the shoes I used in the last 16+ months - quite a wide selection, and several shoes actually have been used for even longer, but as I continue to get plenty of DMs and question on Social Media about my shoes I though it is about time to answer all these questions in one go! By the way, I also used the previously reviewed <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/la-sportiva-crossover-2-dot-0-gtx.html">La Sportiva Crossover 2.0</a> on several hikes in the past year - but then they started to smell after the last hike so badly I had to dispose them! So, <strong>which of these shoes have peaked your interest?</strong> Let me know on <a href="https://instagram.com/hendrikmorkel/">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a>!</p>

<p>My son and me were in Lapland in February, by now already something of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/02/father-son-ski-trip.html">a little tradition</a> for us two. It‚Äôs a great way to bond, talk, have fun together and experience the beauty of our home country. I this case we went to <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/fi/">Saariselk√§</a>, a small village in the North-East of Finland, which I have <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/10/mountainbiking-in-lapland.html">visited</a> <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/urho-kekkonen-national-park.html">numerous</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/-AYVkZf61UE">times</a> over the past years as it‚Äôs located very close to several National Parks, Wilderness areas and is simply a great starting point for outdoor adventures. While we were hiking and skiing in Saariselk√§ also this time, we went on three different <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/open-fell-biking/">Fatbike rides in Saariselk√§ and Kiilop√§√§</a>. As our family are cycling enthusiasts - we still don‚Äôt own a car! - trying out Fatbikes was something that my son and me both looked forward too!</p>

<h2 id="fatbiking-in-kiilop-and-urho-kekkonen-nationalpark">Fatbiking in Kiilop√§√§ and Urho Kekkonen Nationalpark</h2>

<p>Our first trip was with Tuija from the <a href="http://openfellbiking.com/">MTB Project</a> and Raili from <a href="https://www.rolloutdoors.com/fi/kiilopaa/">Roll Outdoors</a>. These two women were fantastic guides and showed us the best and most scenic trails around Kiilop√§√§, and they even organized some glorious weather for us as you can see in the photos ‚òÄÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏èüòé My son and me took the Ski Bus from Saariselk√§ to Kiilop√§√§, a short 20 minute ride which takes you through the beautiful landscape. We met Raili and Tuija at the Roll Outdoors HQ and picked up our Fatbikes: They have e-Fatbikes, Kids Fatbikes, and the Canyon Dude 8.0 Fatbike which we rode. After a short introduction to the bikes and the plan for the day we started to ride through the Gates of the Urho Kekkonen National Park, and headed along the border of the National Park towards the Kiilop√§√§ Snow Bike Park, a good area to get familiar with the bikes in easy terrain and to see what they are capable off. The trails were freshly groomed and it was great riding on these fine trails.</p>

<p>The trails are well marked, and you can get a map to see where you are allowed to ride. Not all trails are allowed for Fatbikes - as tempting as it is to ride on the hard, flat XC Skiing trails: These are off-limits! There are over 50 km of Fatbike Trails, either pure bike trails or then open to both hikers and cyclists. We did encounter on our rides just a handful of hikers, who were always very friendly and excited to see us. Just make sure to slow down or even get off when you pass people, and all can use these trails together happily! We had a short break at the bottom of the Snow Bike Park at a Laavu, and then cycled a different route back to Kiilop√§√§, where we made a proper lunch break.</p>

<p>After good coffee and hot juice, tasty vegan food and chocolate bananas we rode the trail up to Ahonp√§√§t. The views from the trail - we were there right at the Golden Hour, which always gets me a bit excited and I have the urge to just stop every 100 m and take photos üòÜ - were breath-taking. Not just because of the long up-hill, but also because of the magnificent views.</p>

<p>The trees were absolutely beautiful, fully hiding beneath the snow, a warm, golden light was making everything look beautiful and all four of us were just smiling from ear to ear. A moment to remember.</p>

<p>After all the uphill it was time to turn the Fatbikes around and point our tires down and back to Kiilop√§√§! Timo, the <a href="https://www.pallasyllasoutdoors.com">local trail builder</a>, has created a wonderfully flow-trail which gives you great views while you descent. You should <a href="https://youtu.be/WRvGZ18se0o">watch the video</a> to see what I mean, the photos simply don‚Äôt do it justice of how beautiful this trail is!</p>

<p>Happy, and a wee bit cold, we arrived back at the Roll Outdoors Shop in Kiilop√§√§, and went inside of the <a href="https://www.kiilopaa.fi">Suomen Latu</a> building to have a hot chocolate. It was a fantastic day, and both my son and me look back fondly to it!</p>

<h2 id="fatbiking-around-saariselk-village">Fatbiking around Saariselk√§ village</h2>

<p>The next day we rented bikes from <a href="https://www.laplandsafaris.com/en/activities-in-lapland/cycling-and-winter-fat-biking">Lapland Safaris</a> in Saariselk√§ and went on a self-guided trip. As it was snowing and again pretty cold, we decided to ride to the Savottakahvila Caf√© in Laanila, which was a good choice. It was at some point almost a wee Blizzard and it was hard to see far, so we both were happy when we reached the Caf√© and could have a hot chocolate and a Laskiaispulla!</p>

<p>There was an old Prospector‚Äôs cottage close by, and as we both are interested in geology we tried to go there - sadly there‚Äôs no Fatbike trail going to it, and as we didn‚Äôt want to break the Rules we headed back on the same trail to Saariselk√§. By now the weather also started to be a bit more sunny, so it was nice to ride the trails with a fresh cover of snow and in the sunshine ‚òÄÔ∏è‚ùÑ !</p>

<p>On our last day in Saariselk√§ we went Fatbiking with Guide Janne from Lapland Safaris. We got the same bikes as on the previous trip, which was great as they were all dialled in to our heights, and then we took off after Janne!</p>

<p>This time we went a bit off-the-beaten-track and road our Fatbikes towards the west on a Trail which I had hiked back in the autumn of 2019, before turning south and then east again towards Laanila. It was yet again a very snowy and cold day, and big snow flakes were coming down from the grey clouds. The trail was well-maintained but the snow kept growing on it, making for good riding.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51048469761/in/dateposted/" title="J√§nis"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51048469761_295652f292_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="J√§nis" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the middle of the forest we had a break, drunk some hot, tasty juice which gave us back some warmth, and ate a little snack, while playing with the new, soft snow around us, all while it continued to snow. So much beautiful snow! After this wee break we rode on, arriving at Laanila and then continuing on a familiar trail back to the village.</p>

<p>Fatbiking in Saariselk√§ and Kiilop√§√§ was a fantastic winter activity for us. My son got better at riding with each time we rode our Fatbikes, and he really enjoyed the flowy downhill sections of the trails (he didn‚Äôt care that much about uphills, but then: Few do üòÅ). While he didn‚Äôt fall he did at some points simply on purpose fell into the deep, soft snow which is surrounding the trail, which makes for a soft and safe landing. I was happy about the variety of trails available for us, and that many are easy enough for younger children - though I do hope more demanding and longer trails will get built in the next winter! Overall this was a great alternative to XC or downhill skiing, and allowed us to explore the nature at our own speed - faster than hiking, but slow enough to take in the details of the nature surrounding us. Right now in March and April, with the <em>hankikanto</em> (that time of the year where the top snow layer is carrying people and bikes without that you break through) it is also possible to ride almost everywhere, and especially on the open fells and lakes this makes for fun, good riding. But then you still have these awesome trails, which you really should ride!</p>

<h2 id="where-to-stay-what-to-eat-and-everything-else">Where to stay, what to eat and everything else</h2>

<p>We stayed in an Apartment at the <a href="https://www.laplandhotels.com/FI/lapin-hotellit/saariselka/lapland-hotels-riekonlinna.html">Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna Hotel</a> which has an ideal location: 5 minutes from the Store and even less time to be on a trail for skiing, Fatbiking or hiking. The <a href="https://skisaariselka.com/ski-bus/">Ski Bus</a> stops in front of the building, as are the buses to the south and north.</p>

<p>We ate breakfast and dinner at the Hotel, and they served great Vegan food - I really appreciated that! In the afternoons, after we returned from our activities, we usually would sit down at the fire place in the lobby and have a hot chocolate. There are several other Restaurants and Take-Away options in the village, or then we also could have cooked in our apartment.</p>

<p>As usual we travelled by public transportation to Lapland, but if you are not alone then drive your car north - then you are mobile there. Taking the Bus from Rovaniemi to Saariselk√§ is a short and scenic 3 hour ride, and it really gets you in the mood for the outdoors as you ride past lakes and forests and every so often slow down to let the Reindeer get off the road. Taking an (overnight) train to Rovaniemi from Southern Finland is also very convenient, as you wake up well rested and just a short ride away from your next outdoor adventure. This is also a good way to travel if you want to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/outdoors-in-helsinki.html">explore Helsinki</a> before or after a visit in Lapland - or stop for some days in <a href="">Rovaniemi</a> while you are here. Finally, if you come from abroad you also can fly directly to Ivalo, from where you can take a bus or Taxi to Saariselk√§.</p>

<p>In Saariselk√§ you have a great outdoor shop, several Caf√©s and Restaurants and a grocery store. Make sure to read the <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/2020/10/14/travel-safely/">Travel Safely</a> website, use a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/10/reuseable-face-masks.html">Reuseable Face Mask</a> and do all those things which you should do to minimize the risk of getting ill. Other than that - enjoy your holiday in Saariselk√§, Lapland!</p>

<p>Travelling safely during the Covid-19 Pandemic is possible in Finland (with some caveats, more about these <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel/status/1361235118329913344">here</a>) and so my 9-year old son and me travelled to <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/en/">Saariselk√§</a> - long-time readers will remember my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/10/mountainbiking-in-lapland.html">autumn</a> trip there. Saariselk√§ is a tranquil little village with 300 inhabitants and lays at the gates of the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/urho-kekkonen-national-park.html">Urho Kekkonen National Park</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqEBC4yj3Faikt3HHS3jU8l3Fm8pxQvN3">Hammastunturi Wilderness</a>. It has a superb network of Fatbike and XC Skiing trails, a small but very good Ski Resort and plenty of other opportunities of enjoying the outdoors. As well as many great accommodation options, like the wonderful <a href="https://www.laplandhotels.com/EN/hotels-in-lapland/saariselka/lapland-hotels-riekonlinna.html">Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna</a> where we stayed.</p>

<p>We were exceptionally lucky with the weather - it was ‚òÄÔ∏è every day but bitterly cold, some days at low as a felt temperature of -32¬∞C - but even those temps were bearable with the <a href="https://youtu.be/E_ma70A6HkM">right clothes</a> and keeping active!</p>

<p>After we hiked the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/11/mullerthal-trail-route-1.html">Mullerthal Trail Route 1</a> in completely terrible weather, on the morning of our third day the sun is shining, some clouds are slowly moving across the blue sky and it is a nice, warm 15¬∞C outside. It‚Äôs exactly the kind of weather you want when you hike <a href="https://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en/fiche/walking/stage-trail-mullerthal-trail-route-2">Route 2 of the Mullerthal Trail</a>. This is THE Route of the Mullerthal trail, with one scenic spot after the other. Which means, if you‚Äôre a photographer like me, the going will be slow üòÜ</p>

<p>We left Echternach on foot and soon passed the Trooskn√§ppchen view point, where we took a look back on the town which was out home the past three nights. Our luggage will be awaiting us at our next home for the night, so we can hike with light packs on the trail.</p>

<p>The trail goes along the left side of the valley, on the other side of it and the river is Germany, literally a stone throw away. The trail gives nice views on this valley, and the interaction of sunshine and clouds is pretty to observe. It does not take long and we are at the first scenic viewpoint of Route 2, the Wolfsschlucht, a steep canyon in which in past times wolves were hiding. It‚Äôs an impressive sight and we enjoy it a lot, but are surprised that after you have climbed the hundreds of stairs there‚Äôs a small cauldron from which stairs go further up on both sides. We climb both sets of stairs and are rewarded by beautiful views on the valley, with sunshine on our faces ‚òÄÔ∏è</p>

<p>The trail goes on past moss-covered rocks and green beech trees, stairs down, over little bridges, impressive rock walls. A pair of Dutch hikers pass us and ask if we know where the ‚ÄúLabyrinth‚Äù is - which is the next highlight, and which was just a few hundred meters ahead of us =)</p>

<p>The Labyrinth is described as <em>‚Äúa maze of rocks‚Äù</em> but the truth is that i‚Äôs less a maze than just a bunch of rocks where the trail goes through. It‚Äôs pretty, nevertheless. For these 3 km we already needed more than an hour, because of all the photo and video breaks. We arrive at the Perekop viewpoint, and decide to not go climb it - but I briefly let the drone go up and snap some photos from up in the air. The trail now leads away from the road and deeper into a forest canyon, where we go over half a dozen bridges which go over a small stream.</p>

<p>We climb some stairs and then stand in front of the mouth of the Huel Lee cave. This is a really popular spot but the moment we arrive the only other being there with us is a small stray cat, which miaus at us. Huel Lee is a cave where the local mill stones were ‚Äúbroken‚Äù from the rock, which generated this large cave. It‚Äôs a beautiful sight, and later on we learn that this is the only place where the rock quality was right for mill stones. I take a lot of photos while Martin talks to the cat, and as we leave we try to guide it with us back to Berdorf, but the wee cat decides to stay at the cave. We hope it will be well, and walk on.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs three hours after we have left Echternach that we arrive in Berdorf, which amounts to around 2 km of speed per hour. Yeps, that is REALLY slow.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50837160748/in/photostream/" title="Towards Berdorf"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50837160748_9a63541012_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Towards Berdorf" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In Berdorf we head into the <a href="https://en.trailinn.lu">Trail-Inn</a> Caf√© &amp; Restaurant. We order some coffee and some absolutely fantastic cake, but as I order the bill we‚Äôre a bit shocked to pay 20‚Ç¨ for two coffees and pieces of üç∞! As we leave Berdorf Martin and me are very much looking forward to the next section to the M√ºllerthal, there‚Äôs a lot of scenic spots along this section of the trail. Sadly we soon find the trail closed and a Detour sign - a flood destroyed the bridges here, and currently the final bridges and paths are put into place.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50837892771/in/photostream/" title="Um Leit Ung"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50837892771_ddafb377f6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Um Leit Ung" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This detour at least speeds us up considerably, and it‚Äôs also really pretty. We‚Äôre high above the normal trail and can get (careful) glimpses of the scenery down in the valley where Route 2 would take us along - we guess we‚Äôre between 30 and 50 m high up, so standing at the lip of rocks is scary. Not long and we‚Äôre at the Binzeltschl√´ff rock formation, which throwns above a road which is very silent. I fly my Drone again, and then we cross the road and Martin and me climb and squeeze through the Priedegtstull rocks. We laugh a lot here, it‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt usually get to do and if our kids would be here, they‚Äôd love it as much as we, we realize!</p>

<p>As we arrive at the top we realize that we definitely took the most adventurous detour through the rocks, as there also would have been a very easy path up here. But probably it was a lot less fun than our route! We take a look over the land from the viewpoint, and then dive into the forest.</p>

<p>Almost at closing time we arrive at the <a href="https://www.mullerthal-millen.lu/en">Heringer Millen</a>, the tourist centre in the centre of the Mullerthal Trail network. Here you can <a href="https://www.mullerthal-millen.lu/en/touristcenter/bow">loan for free hiking gear</a>, from shoes and jackets to backpacks and even binoculars and GPS receivers. We however take a look at the beautiful old mill, and then hit the trail one last time today to hike on the C5 Trail towards the Camping place ‚Äú<a href="https://www.visitconsdorf.lu/en/camping-la-pinede/camping-la-pinede-2">La Pin√®de</a>‚Äù.</p>

<p>We stay tonight at a Mobilehome, which is nicer than it sounds. Our luggage awaits us as we arrive, and after a warm shower and putting all gadgets charging we head to eat at the <a href="https://www.brass.lu">Brasserie op Buergkapp</a>, which is a Minute away from where we sleep. It‚Äôs a nicely decorated place with really tasty food, and after a delicious starter, main and dessert we fall happily into our beds!</p>

<h2 id="day-2-consdorf-mllerthal---scheidgen---echternach">Day 2 Consdorf/ M√ºllerthal - Scheidgen - Echternach</h2>

<p>This was a long, sunny and enjoyable day of being outdoors in nature. After a good breakfast we hiked up to the Schiessent√ºmpel, the largest waterfall in Luxembourg and most photographed spot on the Mullerthal trail. We were lucky that there wasn‚Äôt a lot of people around this early in the morning, so after many photos and a drone flight (watch the Video!) we continued.</p>

<p>The trail leads up into the forest and we pass impressive rock formations like the Eulenburg, the Goldfralay with its little canyon and where a path leads up to the top of the cliff. It‚Äôs beautiful and we enjoy the scenery, hiking along these high rock walls.</p>

<p>We cross the street not far from the Consdorfer Millen, another mill, and are on a wide forest road while the sun climbs higher and sends its rays through the beech trees.</p>

<p>Then a narrow single trail path leads up into the forest, and not long and we are at the highlights of this section: Three very narrow canyons/ caves, two which also require a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/petzl-bindi-head-torch/?pid=10239">headlamp</a> to get through as they are completely dark. First is the Rittergang, a narrow canyon through which Martin and I squeeze, laughing about this kind of experience.</p>

<p>Next is the Deiwepetz canyon, which feels really long and the trail snakes through this even narrower canyon. It also gets pretty dark once you‚Äôre a few steps away from the entry, and I‚Äôm happy I have my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/petzl-iko-core-head-torch/?pid=10239">Petzl IKO Core</a> along.</p>

<p>We exit the Diewepetz, smiling. The sun shines, it gets warm, and we have one more canyon/ cave in front of us, the best one if we can believe our guide book! To get to the Kuelscheier cave you can hike the marked Circuit Trail, which also takes you up to a viewing point, or you can stay on the trail and get to the entry of the cave. We chose to do the circuit, and then head into the cave. It takes a turn and you‚Äôre in immediate darkness, and without some light you‚Äôre quickly falling or hurting yourself, as it is narrow, there are corners, stairs and narrow passages.</p>

<p>We exit the cave and continue on Route 2 now towards Hersberg, though shortly before the village we take a shortcut and head onwards to Scheidgen.</p>

<p>The warm weather and sunshine are very pleasant, we enjoy every moment out here in nature, being on this wonderful trail. And it does not get boring: It takes us along prehistoric grinding grooves and then leads up out of the forest and we cross some fields, before we are back in the forest. We cross small wooden bridges which allow us to keep the feet dry and take a look at the small M√©chelskierch cave which was home to a hermit in the 18. century.</p>

<p>In Scheidgen we hope into the <a href="https://lebonrepos.lu/restaurant/">Hotel Bon Repos &amp; Restaurant Le Grill</a> for lunch. Martin has a very tasty looking Hamburger while I eat a delicious salad, and we enjoy the view into the kitchen were the Chefs are preparing our food. Route 2 continues now for another 8 km till Echternach, and we hike down into a narrow, wooded valley.</p>

<p>We are passed by three Trailrunners, and now encounter also some more hikers, but not really a lot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the trail is showing itself from its most beautiful side. Light beech forests bath the trail in a warm, green-golden light, while the red-grey-green rock faces surprise us with different forms and make us smile.</p>

<p>After a few hours we arrive above Echternach and enjoy the view on the Abbey from up here in the forest. It‚Äôs funny how different it feels to come back here in warm weather and sunshine, and not soaking wet in the rain! We take a shortcut to the Campground, where we will be sleeping in a <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/sleeping-like-diogenes">Wooden Barrel</a>. We take a really nice warm shower and switch into some <a href="https://tidd.ly/3oCbf13">‚àû clean</a> and <a href="https://tidd.ly/2LeBvAU">‚àû fresh</a> <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/01/DUER-All-Weather-Denim-Jeans.html">clothes</a>, and head again to the Restaurant Aal Eechternoach for our celebratory Dinner!</p>

<h2 id="practicalities---where-to-stay-what-to-eat-and-how-to-get-around">Practicalities - Where to Stay, What to Eat and How to get Around</h2>

<p>We stayed at the start and the end of our trip in Echternach, which is a small town - the oldest in Luxembourg - which we really liked. We stayed the first three nights in the <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/tower-hamelmaous">medieval fortification tower H√§melmaous</a> which really was a beautiful experience. There‚Äôs a cozy kitchen at the ground floor, and then there‚Äôs four more floors in this round tower. It easily should sleep a family of four or more, and it‚Äôs also really close to the centre and the bus stop. At the end of our trip we slept in a <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/sleeping-like-diogenes">Wooden Barrel</a> on the Campground, which was a really cozy experience as well. I slept like a stone in my barrel, which is good for one to two persons and possibly a small child or two. The camping place is a wee bit outta town - some five to ten minutes of walking to the centre, but really close to the trail.</p>

<p>While hiking Route 2 you can stay either at ‚Äú<a href="https://www.visitconsdorf.lu/en/camping-la-pinede/camping-la-pinede-2">La Pin√®de Camping</a>‚Äù in Consdorf or at the <a href="https://lecigalon.lu">H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon</a> in Mullerthal, both are along Route 2 and pretty much in the middle of this trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50897605248/in/dateposted/" title="H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50897605248_ebd18e5549_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Both have options for eating out - at the Camping place in Consdorf we ate at the <a href="https://www.brass.lu">Brasserie op Buergkapp</a> which was tasty and plenty, while at the 4‚≠êÔ∏è Le Cigalon the food was good but it took ages and portions are small - so if you‚Äôre hungry after a long day of hiking, pick wisely!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50900860136/in/dateposted/" title="Vegan Main at H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50900860136_f21e07c7cc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Vegan Main at H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/en/timetables-and-lines/bus/">Public bus transportation in Luxembourg</a> is free. Jump on a bus to get from one corner of the country to the other one (it‚Äôs a small country, so easy to do). The busses are plentiful and seem to stop even in the smallest villages, so hiking the Mullerthal Trail (or any other trail for that matter) in sections is easy to do.</p>

<p>Favourite gear articles are a staple of blogs and magazines at the end of the year. I see gear as an enabler to my trips, but it‚Äôs not the main thing of this hobby for me. Yes, I consider myself a Gear Nerd, and am happy to geek out about sustainable, lightweight and functional equipment &amp; garments, but being outside in nature is more important. Hence my four picks of ‚Äúfavourite gear‚Äù of 2020 actually only includes three pieces of equipment üòÜ I also want to discourage you from thinking that you have to spend ridiculous amounts of ‚Ç¨¬£$ to get this gear or go to the same places than me. Yes, it‚Äôs great kit, yes, it were amazing trips and the destinations should go on your bucket list. But at the same time: Stay local, minimize your environmental footprint and only buy what you need!</p>

<h2 id="more-time--local-trips">More Time // Local Trips</h2>

<p>I didn‚Äôt have a lot of work in 2020, which means I had a lot more ‚Äúfree‚Äù time. With the Pandemic being the main topic of 2020 and me being rather careful to not expose myself to the virus, I did not (<em>could not</em>) travel as much as usual. Instead I made the best of it and travelled locally - a few trips to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/lemmenjoki-national-park.html">Lapland</a> but mostly <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/nuku-yo-ulkona-kvarken-archipelago.html">locally in my Region</a>. This definitely was my favourite part of 2020, we had some fantastic day trips with the family where we were <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/06/sup-adventures-in-the-kvarken-archipelago.html">SUPing</a> and swimming, having picnics and enjoying the warm, sunny weather. This is something which I will continue to do in 2021 and onwards - mostly travelling in Finland, Norway and Sweden, with just the occasional work trip further abroad.</p>

<h2 id="houdini-fleece-jacket">Houdini Fleece Jacket</h2>

<p>I was thinking, while doing my research for this piece, if the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/11/patagonia-r1-air-review.html">Patagonia R1 Air</a> should be in this article. But the truth is, there is one Fleece Jacket which I have worn substantially more in 2020: The <a href="https://bit.ly/390vFwb">‚àû Houdini Power Air Houdi</a> (it‚Äôs replaced by the Mono Air Hoody nowadays!). I own also an <a href="https://bit.ly/3sJ0pJS">‚àû Outright Houdi</a> (3 years old) and a <a href="https://bit.ly/3o0F6zK">‚àû Power Houdi</a> (6 years old) and love both of those heaps, but the Power Air is what I have worn pretty much every day in 2020. A fleece jacket is part of my every day dress code (Yay for Homeoffice/ being an outdoor journalist!), which goes well with a T-Shirt underneath it and a Windjacket over it if I have to go out. My Power Air Houdi has an amazing purple colour üíú and is 633 g light in Size S - which makes it too heavy for backpacking, but perfect for everyday use and day hikes. I‚Äôve been wearing it while traveling, hiking, and working at home, and I also worn it on overnight trips and <a href="https://youtu.be/OCt38Ybiy7w">photo shoots in the middle of the night</a>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a durable piece of kit which is made from the still relatively new <a href="https://youtu.be/_DBPa0wBNZE">Polartec Power Air</a>; that fabric has a new knit construction which encapsulates air to retain warmth and reduce microfiber shedding - it sheds up to five times less microfibres as other fleece fabrics. It keeps you toasty by encapsulating the insulation in hundreds of tiny pockets, with channels running around them for greater breathability. The fabric is stretchy and the Power Air Houdi has an athletic fit, with a comfy hood for when I forgot to put my beanie on, and two zippered hand pockets if also my gloves stayed home. It‚Äôs a fantastic garment which I‚Äôm wearing while writing this article (I just went out quickly to take the underneath photo) and it makes me happy with its good features, sustainable credentials and purple colour. So it is definitely a jacket which I will continue to wear in 2021!</p>

<h2 id="anfibio-rebel-2k-packraft">Anfibio Rebel 2K packraft</h2>

<p>In the summer of 2020 I travelled to Lapland to go backpacking in the Lemmenjoki National Park and then packrafted alone down the Ivalojoki river. Along on that trip I had the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/09/anfibio-rebel-2k-the-most-versatile-packraft.html">Anfibio REBEL 2K</a> packraft, which I enjoyed from bow to stern üòÜ It‚Äôs compact, lightweight, nimble and can handle white water rafting without problems - everything I want from a packraft. I also had it along on local trips on rivers and on the Baltic Sea, and time and again it made me smile while paddling and carrying it. I‚Äôm already now planning new trips with it in the spring, summer and autumn, and if you are curious about packrafting then look no further than the Anfibio REBEL 2K packraft! <em>The best thing is that you can <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Rentals:::34.html?language=en">loan packrafts</a> starting from 70‚Ç¨ from the Packrafting Store, which is perfect if you want to try this sport without committing to a 1.000,00 ‚Ç¨ or more investment!</em></p>

<h2 id="huckepacks-phoenix">HUCKEPACKS Phoenix</h2>

<p>When Mateusz called me in 2019 and told me he will reopen his cottage, I was really happy for him! Since then I have carried his new pack creations on almost all of my trips in 2020, and the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/09/huckepacks-phoenix-lite-review.html">HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite</a> is hands-down the best backpacking rucksack I have used in the past year(s). It‚Äôs 474 g light with all bells &amp; whistles, and carries even heavy loads with lots of food like a dream. The pack handled <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/11/mullerthal-trail-route-1.html">constant rain</a> just fine, and Version 2.0 - which was released last autumn - even improves on the original design. This will also in 2021 be my pack of choice, and I can‚Äôt wait to go backpacking with it again this year!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For 10+ years, I haven‚Äôt worn any jeans. But in autumn 2019 the DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans arrived with me, and in the past two winters they have become my go-to trousers. So much so, that I am wearing it now since four months (and yes, that means it hasn‚Äôt been in the wash that long!).</p>

<p>Since around 2008 I haven‚Äôt worn a pair of jeans. My last jeans were from an Italian brand, but even when I still owned them I didn‚Äôt wear them much. My trousers, or pants, whatever you like to call them, were made from another fabric than denim. Mostly Polyester, but also linen, cotton and other synthetic fabrics were what I liked to wear, and actually still do for most of the year. But in the autumn of 2019 the <a href="https://bit.ly/3s2D4m2">‚àû DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans</a> appeared at my porch, and while I was sceptical at first - I love my Houdini pants to bits - I also was curious to try these jeans, as they feature a water repellant and breathable membrane underneath the denim fabric.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50808928773/in/dateposted/" title="DUER All-Weather Denim"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50808928773_56706b96d0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DUER All-Weather Denim" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809668396/in/dateposted/" title="Instructions // DUER All-Weather Denim"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809668396_7edd02e6f8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Instructions // DUER All-Weather Denim" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The denim fabric is what makes DUER jeans special, as it is not 100% cotton, but the fabric is called L2X Denim and consists of 70% Cotton, 28% Coolmax (that‚Äôs made from Polyester) and 2% Lycra. This makes the jeans more stretchy and rather comfortable to wear, especially for cycling. The denim fabric also has a Silvadur treatment, that‚Äôs a bacterial inhibition treatment to extend the time you can wear the jeans without washes. Right now, as depicted on the photos in this article, the jeans has been worn daily for four months without that it has been in the washing machine. My regular Houdini trousers I wear anywhere between two and four weeks, then it simply is too obvious that I have been wearing the pants for a long time because you can see dirt on them. These DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans have a quite dark fabric, which ‚Äúhides‚Äù dirt easier, but it probably also helps that I usually wear them when it starts to get around 0¬∞C and so there isn‚Äôt too much mud &amp; dirt around - it‚Äôs pretty much all frozen when I wear them.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809786542/in/dateposted/" title="DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans Pockets n Stuff"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809786542_6d8a11887e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans Pockets n Stuff" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Because these pants have a membrane on the inside underneath the denim fabric - that membrane has a water resistance rating of 18.150 mm and a Moisture Vapor Transmission Rate (MVTR) rating of 13.000 G/M2/M24hrs - these are WARM üî• pants. It has to be -5¬∞C or more and really windy for me to put on some <a href="https://tidd.ly/3b8r7VS">‚àû long underwear</a> on underneath them, for temperatures above that the pants are warm enough on their own for me. This makes them really great winter pants in my opinion, as this membrane in combination with the DUER L2X Denim is giving me a pair of trousers which keep wind and snow at bay and me toasty and warm, all while looking like a regular pair of jeans. I can not wear these jeans if it‚Äôs above 5¬∞C, as then I simply run to hot, so for me this is a cold weather jeans. However, it is comfortable also when inside - the usual inside temperature in Finland is around 22¬∞C - and if you‚Äôre not exercising on a bike indoors with these jeans on, then you should feel just fine - that‚Äôs where the <em>breathability</em> of the membrane comes in handy.</p>

<p>Alright, they only almost look like a regular pair of jeans, as they have some smart details which make them stand out a wee bit. One detail is the reflective DU/ER logo font on the inside of the trouser legs (it‚Äôs called a cuff, I‚Äôm told =), which makes you more visible in traffic in the dark. This is a wonderful detail and really useful in dark Finland &amp; Scandinavia, and once you‚Äôd arrive at the office, library or Caf√© you could just roll the trouser leg down to hide the reflective detail again. Me, I keep them up, all the time. The pants are a length of 32‚Äù and rolled up it‚Äôs the perfect length for me, and stops just around my ankle.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809669601/in/photostream/" title="Cycling with the DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809669601_896a9fc249_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cycling with the DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There‚Äôs also a reflective logo patch at the waistband, so in case you aren‚Äôt wearing a reflector like every smart non-suicidal person in the North should in winter, you also could be seen via it if you have your jacket that high up. I don‚Äôt but then I have a reflector or two on my jacket. Other features include triple stitched inseams, gussets and back rises, so during all that cycling nothing rips open, double layered back pockets which should be equally durable and long-lasting, and in case you‚Äôre wondering: Yes, this is a five pocket jeans, and I‚Äôm wearing mine in the Slim Cut (there‚Äôs a <a href="https://bit.ly/3q1263g">‚àû Relaxed Jeans</a> available, too).</p>

<p>These are my go-to pants in winter, usually between late September and around late March, when it starts to get warm again. During these six-ish months I happily put on my DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans every day, and go cycling to the grocery store, walking and sledding with the kids, for a walk in the forest or visit a Caf√© in town for a tasty coffee and some Pulla. They have great freedom of movement - they were made as a cycling jeans, after all - and look rather stylish, but the real selling point for me is that these jeans are made to be outside in cold weather, and that they don‚Äôt need to be washed that often. That‚Äôs good for the environment in several ways, and as these pants are made to last, I expect them to keep my toasty for another eight or nine winters!</p>

<p>If you‚Äôd like to grab a pair for yourself - they are available as a Men‚Äôs and <a href="https://bit.ly/3bhwthz">‚àû¬†Women‚Äôs version</a> - order them either directly from <a href="https://bit.ly/3s2D4m2">‚àû DUER</a> if you‚Äôre in North America, in Europe you can get them from <a href="https://tidd.ly/3b7VbRz">‚àû Bergzeit</a> and in Finland from <a href="https://varuste.net/p99564/duer-all-weather-performance-denim-slim-jeans">Varuste</a>.</p>

<p>Behind me lay the solitude of the Hetta-Pallas Trail, in front of me was <a href="https://www.yllas.fi/en/home-page.html">Yll√§s</a> and √Ñk√§slompolo with it‚Äôs many different options of fun in the snow. My new friends dropped me off at the <a href="https://sevenfellshostel.com/en/7-fells-hostel-eng/">7 Fells Hostel</a>, where I moved my stuff into the cozy little cabin which was waiting for me. Outside the sun was setting, but that didn‚Äôt stop me from a short stroll to explore the surroundings a bit more. √Ñk√§slompolo is a compact and cozy village, probably one of the best Finnish winter villages as it is home to both the largest ski resort in Finland as well as a very extensive XC skiing network with over 400 km of Tracks. Add in superb possibilities for skitouring, Fatbiking and winter hiking, and you understand why this little village is so popular with winter lovers.</p>

<h2 id="fatbiking-in-ylls">Fatbiking in Yll√§s</h2>

<p>The next morning brought clear and sunny skies, and it was an easy decision to head back out into the cold again. Going outside makes my life better, it‚Äôs a way to disconnect for hours from Social Media and the internet, and to do something which I like a lot better than sitting in front of a screen: Being in nature, breathing fresh, cold air, feeling the sun and wind on my cheeks. I decided to go for a Fatbike ride, as I could loan a Fatbike from the friendly folks of the 7 Fells Hostel, and they have a really nice Fatbike Trail network in Yll√§s! I rode through the village, past the supermarket, Caf√©s and sports shops, towards the start of the trails.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802510028/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Riding"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802510028_f7dec84430_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Riding" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803257031/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Getting all the Infos"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803257031_d265ccc9be_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Getting all the Infos" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>It was a warm and sunny day, the temperature was +2¬∞C and it was perfect for riding the Fatbike. There were very few people around - this was just at the start of the first Lockdown of 2020 in Finland, and pretty much only locals were around, as well as a very few visitors. I decided to ride to the Kes√§nkij√§rvi Laavu - five years ago I went skitouring on Kes√§nki and I have really good memories of this fjell, and at least seeing it from the lake would make me happy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803257121/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Which way?"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803257121_26715d4e57_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Which way?" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But that wasn‚Äôt the only thing which made me happy. Riding in this warm weather, in the sun, on empty Fatbike trails, through young birch forests, over swamps and always with the beautiful hills in view, also made me happy. Really happy üòä</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803257751/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="&lt;Mountain"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803257751_47899021f8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="&lt;Mountain" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803373287/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Palls-Yll√§stunturi National Park"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803373287_fe507071fd_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Palls-Yll√§stunturi National Park" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Soon I entered the Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park, where the trails became a bit more narrow, and I was hollering and smiling as I rode through the forest, past the lake shore and towards the wee Laavu at the end of the trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803373447/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Closed Laavu"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803373447_dbe1030b09_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Closed Laavu" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At the Kes√§nki Laavu a thin line of smoke was rising from the fire pit. A large yellow sign was hanging at the top of the Laavu, telling visitors in Finnish, Swedish and English that it was closed because of COVID-19. I had a small sip of water from my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/hydro-flask-standard-mouth-with-standard-flex-cap-isolierflasche/?pid=10239">‚àû bottle</a>, took a few bites from my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/clif-bar-clif-nut-butter-filled-chocolate-hazelnut-butter-energieriegel/?pid=10239">‚àû Nut Butter Clif Bar</a> and explored the surroundings. There‚Äôs a Caf√© across the XC Tracks - which also was closed - where there were two persons, who were, like me, enjoying the sun and silence.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802512608/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Closed Caf√©"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802512608_fe64e153f3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Closed Caf√©" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I was tempted to ride back over the lake, but thought better of it and came the same way - it was a good single track over all, and as it was warm and a yellow sign was warning me that the track over the lake was closed, I opted for the safe alternative. Longingly I watched back towards the hills, wishing I could go ski-touring on them in this grand weather‚Ä¶</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803259061/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Wee Hills"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803259061_c6f1f007ab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Wee Hills" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="skitouring-to-kuertunturi">Skitouring to Kuertunturi</h2>

<p>The next morning was already my last full day in √Ñk√§slompolo, and the weather was grey. Let me be honest: I slept in, had a long breakfast, was reading and at some point in the early afternoon decided I better make the best use of my time here in the snow of Lapland - back home there was no snow, after all. So I packed my gear, put on my <a href="https://tidd.ly/3nn9nIY">‚àû ski boots</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/pXmXznusheI">backpack</a> and skinned up Kuertunturi, which rises up just behind my Cabin at the 7 Fells Hostel. Half-way up I also shot a short video about dressing for ski-touring:</p>

<p>Then my <a href="https://www.dpsskis.com/collections/men/products/wailer_a100_rp">skis</a> and <a href="https://tidd.ly/3pSa5zu">‚àû contour Hybrid skins</a> brought me further up the hill. OK, maybe my legs also had something to contribute‚Ä¶</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803371057/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Skis"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803371057_ee46c318d8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Skis" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802513378/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Top"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802513378_e81d700825_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Top" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At the top of this easy hill - there‚Äôs also a well-marked winter hiking trail going to the summit - I found good weather and amazing views. I had a clear view towards the closed Yll√§s ski resort, Kes√§nki and Lainiotunturi and the over 50 km distant Pallastunturi hills, which I skied across just a few days prior! It was an absolutely stunning scenery which lay around me, and if the sun wouldn‚Äôt have been setting already I probably would have stayed longer to enjoy my last evening in Lapland from the summit of a fjell.</p>

<p>But as the sun was already setting, and my descent through the forest was in the shadow, I decided to head back down. I had some good turns, some ice, some fun moments and some pushing across a frozen swamp before I was back at my cabin, where a warm shower and a tasty <a href="https://tidd.ly/3rUiV1m">‚àû LYO Food meal</a> were waiting for me. As well as some packing, but at least that‚Äôs something which I have down pretty well!</p>

<h2 id="visiting-ylls">Visiting Yll√§s</h2>

<p>Your first stop should be the <a href="https://www.yllas.fi/en/news/corona-info">Yll√§s Corona Info Website</a> and the <a href="https://koronaturvallinenlappi.fi/en/home/">Coronavirus situation in Lapland</a> website, which inform you both about the hygiene concept in Yll√§s and the ski resort as well as the current COVID-19 situation in all of Lapland. Personally I would avoid the ‚Äúbusy‚Äù weeks and go when very few people are in Lapland, to minimize the risk of getting exposed and/ or putting a strain on the health care system. You yourself obviously should either have a negative PCR Test that is not older than three days or already received the vaccine. If that is all in order: Plan your trip!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802510513/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="My Cabin at the 7 Fells Hostel"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802510513_47c2045f74_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="My Cabin at the 7 Fells Hostel" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I stayed at the very stylish &amp; cozy <a href="https://sevenfellshostel.com/en/7-fells-hostel-eng/">7 Fells Hostel</a> which I can highly recommend, and also the <a href="https://yllaslodge.com/en/">Lodge 67ÀöN</a> gets good reviews. There are more <a href="https://www.yllas.fi/en/accommodation.html">accommodation options in Yll√§s</a>, too, from Hotels to cabins in the woods. Yll√§s has a host of <a href="https://www.yllas.fi/en/services.html">services</a>, from eating out over rental gear to shopping for groceries, so you can find everything in the village in case you forgot something or want to try XC skiing or Fatbiking!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803375862/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Busstop"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803375862_689c24eba9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Busstop" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>To the North and back South I travelled with <a href="https://www.onnibus.com/home">OnniBus</a>, <a href="https://www.matkahuolto.fi/en">local busses</a> and the <a href="https://www.vr.fi/en">train</a>, and while it is a long trip it is affordable, comfortable and takes less time than driving by car. If you have to get around in the village, there‚Äôs a ski bus and also taxis, so there really is no need for an own car.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802514333/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Road Home"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802514333_3f06d67995_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Road Home" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong> I think I spent again too few days in Yll√§s. I still haven‚Äôt skied in its ski resort, and would love to go on more skitouring trips on the surrounding hills. Also the amazing XC Tracks are really inviting, so a longer trip to this hidden pearl is in order! What about you - have you been to √Ñk√§slompolo and Yll√§s?

<h2 id="big-trails-great-britain--ireland">Big Trails: Great Britain &amp; Ireland</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50743200828/in/photostream/" title="Big Trails Great Britain &amp; Ireland"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50743200828_827eb79e16_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Big Trails Great Britain &amp; Ireland" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This is my review copy of Vertebrate Publishing‚Äôs <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/walking/big-trails-great-britain-ireland/">Big Trails: Great Britain &amp; Ireland</a> book - I contributed a few images for the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/06/hiking-the-causeway-coast-way.html">Causeway Coast Way</a> in Northern Ireland to it! I might be biased thus, but this is an really good book to discover new trails and get really good information on them. The structure on how the trails are presented is very useful for future hikers, and starts off with a nice text presentation of the hike, as well as a map where in the UK or Ireland you can find this trail - and I really like that the trail is shown completely on this map, as that helps you get a feel for it. Beautiful photos make the trail look perfect and show what landscapes you can expect, which is followed by the Essential Information part: Here you get all the important information on how to get there, how long it might take to complete, the Pros &amp; Cons and where to find further information. A more detailed map of the complete trail also helps you plan the hike. There are 25 different Trails in this book, located in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and England. The trails are anything from 55 km in length to 300 km or more. If you find this book interesting but would rather stay in mainland Europe, then the sister book <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/walking/big-trails-heart-of-europe/">Big Trails: Heart of Europe</a> might be better for you.</p>

<p>Buy the book directly from <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/walking/big-trails-great-britain-ireland/">Vertebrate Publishing</a>, at your local book shop or order it from <a href="https://amzn.to/3h75cz8">‚àû Amazon.com</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3auMaS2">‚àû Amazon.co.uk</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2KOnKIn">‚àû Amazon.de</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-last-hillwalker-bothy-tales-and-sky-dance">The Last Hillwalker, Bothy Tales and Sky Dance</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50744046602/in/photostream/" title="The Last Hillwalker, Bothy Tales and Skydance"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50744046602_bf9686d269_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Last Hillwalker, Bothy Tales and Skydance" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I bought these three books, maybe in part because they got so many good reviews, because Alex Roddie was the Editor for them, and also because I wanted something ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to read in the evening (I have read a lot of Science Fiction in the last months =). I wasn‚Äôt disappointed with these books, and they were really good entertainment. The only bad thing was that I always wanted to go sleep in a tent under a quilt, instead of a warm bed üòÜ. I first read <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/narratives/the-last-hillwalker/">The Last Hillwalker</a>, then <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/narratives/bothy-tales/">Bothy Tales</a> and then <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/narratives/narratives-sky-dance/">Sky Dance</a>, which is also the recommended order by the author.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/narratives/the-last-hillwalker/">The Last Hillwalker</a> was a very good book, and takes us along on John‚Äôs adventures of the past 40 years or hiking, climbing, backpacking and camping. I think for us younger hillwalking and hiking humans it‚Äôs fun to read how it was to start hillwalking and climbing 40+ years ago, as it is rather different than nowadays where you go online to find information, help and friends to go out with. The Stories in each chapter are entertaining, make you chuckle or think or both, and it‚Äôs tempting to read ‚Äújust one more chapter‚Äù before heading to bed. The Last Hillwalker is a great book, and should give you a few good evenings of reading.</p>

<p>The second book, <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/narratives/bothy-tales/">Bothy Tales</a>, was a collection of short stories about Bothies, the open wilderness huts in the UK. This book was much shorter than the other two, and also the one I enjoyed the least. Maybe it was because it felt that most stories had the same elements: Hike in with a bag of coal to a distant bothy in the darkness, with rain or snow often also included, light a fire, make food, drink a dram. The book definitely had some fun moments - especially as my best friend‚Äôs name is also Martin, and we have experienced in the past 12 years similar situations as the protagonists of this book. Overall I felt this was a weaker book, but for a completionist probably still a must-read book.</p>

<p>John‚Äôs 3rd book, <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/narratives/narratives-sky-dance/">Sky Dance</a>, is his best work to date. It‚Äôs less autobiographical, less short stories, and more a really great novel. I had a hard time each evening putting the book down to go to sleep, as the story is really well written, captivating and also about an issue which is close to my heart. The two main characters, Angus &amp; Rory, are relatable and very likeable, and <em>‚Äúdo what is right‚Äù</em>. With this book it feels John has grown as an author, and it makes me looking forward to <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/books-new-and-coming-soon/books-new-and-coming-soon-wild-winter/">his fourth book in April 2021</a>. You can read this book completely on its own, as you don‚Äôt need any of the information of the previous two books, but if you have read them some things will make you chuckle as there are smart call-backs to the previous works. Overall a great book that I can highly recommend!</p>

<h2 id="das-alpenbuch">Das Alpenbuch</h2>

<p>I received this Review copy of <a href="https://marmotamaps.com/en/book-of-the-alps/">The Book of the Alps</a> as my good friend Bj√∂rn K√∂cher is one of the authors. This book, which is in German language, is a feast for the eyes. It has 46 chapters, which are sub-divided into seven subject areas: Geography, Flora and Fauna, Climate and Environment, Alpinism, Mountain Sports, Society and Economy and Arts and Culture. Every single page is jam-packed full of interesting information which are in turn depicted in easy-to-understand graphics, and <em>not just some graphics out of Word</em> but carefully crafted graphics which tell you about the different topics and issues. Be it which animal lives where on a mountain, a timeline of alpinism in the Alps or which ski length to pick for which art of skiing. This is a book which I read in the afternoon, between work sessions, with a cup of coffee, and I love to absorb the useful information and the pretty graphics. A fantastic book which I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about the Alps in Europe &amp; everything connected to them, as it is beautiful and full-to-the-brim with information for us outdoor enthusiasts.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50743201188/in/photostream/" title="Wanderlust Europe"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50743201188_19f46b815f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Wanderlust Europe" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://gestalten.com/products/wanderlust-europe">Wanderlust Europe</a>. My (digital) friend <a href="https://www.alexroddie.com">Alex Roddie</a> wrote this visual tome of long hikes in Europe. Every trail is accompanied by a nice text which makes you curious about the trail in question, again with beautiful images to give you a feeling of what to expect. A map at the end of each Trail shows you where you‚Äôll be hiking and helps with planning, as does the <em>Good to know</em> section which gives basic infos. This is as much a coffee table book which is nice to flip through while you‚Äôre relaxing, as it is a book to plan the next dozen long hikes you want to do in Europe. While this book showcases some of the best-known Trails in Europe which are already pretty busy (Kungsleden, The Pennine Way, Tre Cime Circuit, etc.) it also highlights some pretty new trails. If you‚Äôre new to the hobby of hiking &amp; backpacking, and don‚Äôt know where to go in your next summer holiday, this book will give you plenty to choose from!</p>

<p>In January 2002 I moved to Finland. Before I moved to this country in the North-East of Europe, I had visited the country and <a href="https://www.myhelsinki.fi/en/">capital Helsinki</a> a handful of times, and it always left me with a good feeling. The feeling that I could be who I want to be. Society didn‚Äôt care that I had long hairs, and I got the exact same treatment at the store like the young mother in her Marimekko dress and the bank clerk in a suit. I loved this feeling of being able to be me, like I wanted to be.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50729075868/in/dateposted/" title="Make-up Selfie"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50729075868_fdef715d29_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Make-up Selfie" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50729076833/in/photostream/" title="Best Sandals"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50729076833_a363cef537_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Best Sandals" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>During my visits to Helsinki, and also living here for a bit while I was working at a sustainability startup and then in 2018 spending a wonderful summer in the capital with my kids while my wife worked at a Service Design Agency, this feeling of freedom to be and do grew. It is something I hugely appreciate: The possibility to life in the centre of the capital where I can put my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning shoes</a> on and go for a run in the city‚Äôs nature. Taking my small kids on a free boat trip to Suomenlinna and eat an ice cream (<em>if your child sits in a pram, you can use public transportation for free in Helsinki!</em>). Riding my bike on the extensive bike roads through the city. Walking safely to the harbour to take long exposure photos of well-known buildings in the middle of the night. All this is possible in Helsinki, without stress and in safety.</p>

<p>As you might know from my previous articles, in Helsinki you are never far away from nature, too. In my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/outdoors-in-helsinki.html">Outdoor Guide to Helsinki</a> I have shown how easy it is to enjoy the outdoors in and around the city, and a small Microadventure in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/microadventure-sipoonkorpi-national-park.html">Sipoonkorpi National Park</a> is just as easy as it is simply a short bus ride away. Going so easily and quickly to nature is a freedom which I really appreciate about Helsinki - if the hustle and bustle of the city gets too much it is not difficult to escape for a wee bit, so that you can <a href="https://www.myhelsinki.fi/en/work-and-study/helsinki-freedom/freedom-to-breathe">breathe in nature</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50729899462/in/dateposted/" title="Kota"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50729899462_342e41244f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Kota" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/43900435821/" title="A beautiful Kota"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1819/43900435821_88217d2d49_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="A beautiful Kota" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But you don‚Äôt have to take a bus to Sipoo or Nuuksio to get into nature, right in the city there‚Äôs plenty of parks, public beaches and small islands which are inviting for a walk, swim or picknick. Seakayaking or paddling is a fantastic way to explore the capital, and being on the water, paddling to a small island and going for a swim are for me the definition of being free.</p>

<p>It is not just nature, which is easily accessible in Helsinki. I loved visiting <a href="https://youtu.be/vFQ-iLa3m88">RopeCon</a> and meeting fellow geeks and nerds from all over Finland, and the Helsinki Pride Parade is a beautiful happening to attend and enjoy, <a href="https://www.myhelsinki.fi/en/work-and-study/helsinki-freedom/freedom-to-love">whatever your sexual orientation</a>. It‚Äôs one of the beauties of Helsinki and Finland, that you are free to be who you want to be: Gay, queer, non-binary, a role-playing geek or a hockey fan. Maybe that is why Finland was ranked as the <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2020/#read">happiest country in the World</a> in 2018 and 2019, and Helsinki is the happiest city in the world?!</p>

<p>It could be that that is the reason. And the city does a lot of things very well: Good public transportation, amazing Museums, libraries and public beaches and Caf√©s and Restaurants for any taste, from local over vegan to delicious Asian food, you can find anything to <a href="https://kathrindeter.com/category/restaurants/">suit your taste</a> in Helsinki when you get hungry. As the leading Nation in coffee consumption on the planet you can get plenty of amazing cups of coffee at the many lovely Caf√©s, too ‚òïÔ∏è</p>

<p>There are many more good reasons why Helsinki is a great place to life. One more I can think of is that it‚Äôs very simple to start your own business in Finland, and Helsinki has a superb Start-up scene where you can connect with like-minded people and bounce off your ideas. Equally there are also many good companies to work for in different industries. Heck, you might even be able to keep your current job and simply move to Helsinki to live the good life in Finland! So in case you now are pondering coming to live (and hike!) in Finland, have a look at these five <a href="https://www.myhelsinki.fi/en/work-and-study/helsinki-freedom">interesting short movies</a> which highlight some of the aspects I mentioned in this article.</p>

<p>As for me, I am looking forward to my next visit to Helsinki, to meet friends, stroll along the coast, drink a tasty coffee and hear the waves lap against the shore! Maybe I will meet you there?</p>

    <updated>2020-11-18T19:17:37+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com//2020/11/the-digital-dilemma</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a problem when I go outdoors. The problem sits in my left trouser pocket, is a rectangle shape, a tad under 200 g light, and is called a phone. The problem is: It connects me to the world outside of this place where I am hiking and camping. And I wonder, if it is what I really want.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50617227087/in/dateposted/" title="At the Crossroads"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50617227087_25289982f0_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="At the Crossroads" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Chances are, you read this article on your phone. Hiking in Finland is a digital publication, and the chances are high, too, that you follow me on some of the Social Media networks that are out there: Instagram, Twitter, Youtube and Facebook.</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the problem, Hendrik?‚Äù</em> you might ponder. Well, when I go outdoors, it is in 9 out of 10 cases for work. I‚Äôm in a really fortunate situation that I was able to make being outdoors my work. Ski-touring, backpacking, climbing or bikepacking - it‚Äôs my work. No complaints there, it‚Äôs awesome. I love being outdoors, and it is good for my mental health and general wellbeing.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the Dilemma, which I referred to earlier: That phone in my pocket. And the possibility to let you, my dear readers, Fans and friends, be part of my trip right in the instant.</p>

<p>The problem is also the possibilities that the phone gives me. <em>‚ÄúI could share now how beautiful it is to sit at this fire!‚Äù</em> Or I could watch some Youtube videos. Read the News. See what others are up to on Twitter.</p>

<p>But do I do this for you, or do I do this for me? Do I need this <em>‚Äúinstant gratification‚Äù</em> which I could get from positive reactions on Social Media?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50617115311/in/photostream/" title="Instagram Outdoors?!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50617115311_10ddfcaac2_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Instagram Outdoors?!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think I do it for me. Yes, I love to share my experiences from amazing places like the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/11/mullerthal-trail-route-1.html">Mullerthal Trail</a> in October, because I want to share with you how beautiful and wonderful this place is. But could it just wait? Would that allow me to experience and enjoy the place even more, if I wouldn‚Äôt need to feel like I <em>‚ÄúHave to share‚Äù</em> this on Social Media right here and now?</p>

<p>I have done this, even on paid work trips, and it never has been an issue. It‚Äôs a wee bit more work (because I then need to remember to upload the stories and photos later on) but it‚Äôs possible. And it makes the trip a tad more enjoyable, because there‚Äôs one less thing to take care of.</p>

<p>But then, it‚Äôs not instant. I might make it look like I‚Äôm out all the time, which, you know by now, I am not. Not normally, definitely not this year. But it gives the impression, and while it might delight some people to see my latest photo of some amazing camp spot, it just as well might be making someone else more depressed that they don‚Äôt life this ‚Äúamazing outdoor lifestyle‚Äù.</p>

<p>And would I miss the conversations, likes and comments? Yes. I like the chats I have with friends and Fans on Youtube, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook about trips, books, equipment, and always am happy to help and try to answer them all. Because I care.</p>

<p>But I try to get rid of putting any meaning to these numbers: How many likes, comments and RTs something gets. I do this for me, and you. And while at the same time I really appreciate, want and also need them (and especially the algorithms on all the Social Media platforms want them), I try to make a number not seem important to me. It is not, after all.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50616379803/in/photostream/" title="Flightmode Engaged"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50616379803_fed199361e_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Flightmode Engaged" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>When I am outdoors I try to really stay offline. It usually has a practical reason, too: Batteries in phones don‚Äôt last forever, and I only carry one power bank with me. And while I use the phone for navigating and photography, most of the time it is in Flightmode with all means of communication switched off. That makes the battery last the longest, and makes me less distracted. And when I navigate on steep, icy hills, being not distracted about some silly online stuff is good, because it means I won‚Äôt fall down üòÜ</p>

<p>All this is a long way of saying: In the future I plan not to post from the trail or mountains. When I feel lazy (as I don‚Äôt want to plan to do it later) or can not resist, I still might share some Instagram Stories from trips. When there‚Äôs an amazing Aurora Borealis, or an insane sunset, I might even post a photo right then &amp; there. But for the most part, what you will see from me on Social Media Networks, will be memories from times gone past. That doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm outside all the time, even if I wish that could be the case, but it allows me to enjoy my time in the outdoors more. And that, Dear Reader, is probably the small nugget of wisdom I hope you take along from this article: To <strong>switch the phone off when you head outdoors, because it is good to be disconnected.</strong></p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>It is toasty warm, it is really light for what it does, and it lets all the air through so you want to wear something over the <a href="https://bit.ly/2UtFMRK">‚àû Patagonia R1 Air</a> so the wind doesn‚Äôt blow away that lovely warm air layer around you! You can <a href="https://youtu.be/7vDo7rT7uv4">watch the Video</a> to get a good idea of this sweet piece of kit.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I bought the <a href="https://bit.ly/3nWwSsi">‚àû Patagonia R1 Air Zip-Neck</a> in October and have been using it for around 10 days as I write this Review, for short day hikes, cycling and picking up the post üòÅ</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583047341/in/album-72157716816476902/" title="Patagucci"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583047341_e4fe099eb1_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Patagucci" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>This is a Midlayer garment made for cold weather and high exertion activities like winter backpacking, trailrunning in cold weather, mountaineering and ski touring. It works well for picking up the Post and Day hikes, too.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>I bought my Zip-Neck in Size S and it fits me perfectly (this is a slim fit garment, and I‚Äôm still 175 cm tall with a weight of 65 kg). It weighs 258 g.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50582306183/in/dateposted/" title="258 g in Size S"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50582306183_f932ba6fdf_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="258 g in Size S" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The features of this Zip-Neck, according to the Patagonia website:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hollow-core fabric with a unique zigzag texture</li>
  <li>A tiny Zippered Chest Pocket</li>
  <li>Off-shoulder seams</li>
  <li>A Half-zip for venting</li>
  <li>Soft Cuffs and Hem</li>
  <li>Fair Trade Certified‚Ñ¢ sewn</li>
  <li>HeiQ Anti-Smell finish</li>
</ul>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50582306843/in/dateposted/" title="Zig. Zag."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50582306843_c6c887102c_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Zig. Zag." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>The fabric of the R1 Air is 100% recycled polyester, which is getting increasingly common nowadays and which is a positive development. Hollow fibres also have been around for a while (used for example in <a href="https://www.fiberpartner.com/products/fibers/hollow-polyester-fibers/">pillows and duvets</a>), and if my memory doesn‚Äôt betray me there are already a few outdoor apparel brands which have used hollow core fabrics in their garments.</p>

<p>Now that zig-zag pattern, which Patagonia says is <em>Unique</em>. I had to re-read my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/11/hoodylicious.html">Hoodylicious</a> article from 2012 as I was thinking that maybe the Silkbody Cellular Pilot Top had a similar fabric pattern, but it did not. My next step was to <a href="https://twitter.com/townsendoutdoor/status/1326852082708656128">consult Chris Townsend</a> as he has forty plus years more experience than me, and also he does not recall seeing such a pattern in outdoor garments before. So there we go, Patagonia indeed is the first to use this zig zag pattern <em>(and it‚Äôs warm &amp; good, as you‚Äôll read in a moment)</em>!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583048346/in/dateposted/" title="Open Zipper"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583048346_1ee8d9adba_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Open Zipper" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>This is a Patagucci, √§h, Patagonia piece. It‚Äôs a premium brand, and you pay a premium price, and so also the quality is premium. The R1 Air line of garments are Fair Trade Certified sewn in Sri Lanka, and the quality is indeed great, as you would expect.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50582304163/in/dateposted/" title="Made in Sri Lanka"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50582304163_89749533df_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Made in Sri Lanka" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>As it is made from 100% recycled polyester and is certified as bluesign¬Æ approved, with a HeiQ biocide finish (which is made from recycled silver salt) this is a garment which makes me smile - because it does well in terms of sustainability. <a href="http://www.kingwhale.com">Kingwhale in Taiwan</a> produces the hollow-core fabric, which is then shipped to Sri Lanka where is is made into the garments which we then wear outdoors. The Zip-Neck arrived with just a small hang tag and in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/plastic-wrapped-outdoor-gear.html">a small plastic bag</a>, so also on that front I am happy. If it is broken you can send it in to Patagonia to <a href="https://bit.ly/3kvDv3l">get it repaired</a>, and if you think it has served you enough over many cold winters, you could send it to Patagonia‚Äôs <a href="https://bit.ly/3eXq5f7">Worn Wear</a> initiative so that they can recycle it, or fix it and let it go on more adventures with someone else.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>Please treat this as an early review. This garment is available since late October 2020 - it was <a href="https://youtu.be/uYtkQtaUAq8">announced at the ISPO in January</a> and hence any ‚ÄúReviews‚Äù you see online should be treated as ‚Äúearly impressions‚Äù after a wee bit of usage - unless you read this in May 2021 üòâ</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583043546/in/dateposted/" title="Thin"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583043546_13f43df6eb_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Thin" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As I wrote above already, I have used this Midlayer now 10 days for short day hikes, cycling and picking up the post. I haven‚Äôt been out backpacking with it, and I also haven‚Äôt used it for <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning</a> as right now it‚Äôs too warm for me to use such a garment for running. Speaking of temperatures - it‚Äôs right now November, with temps between 0¬∞C and 8¬∞C during the day, with frost at night. Already from the little usage I have and my 12+ years experience of winter backpacking I think this garment is made for significantly colder weather than this warm November, so I‚Äôm looking forward to taking it out ski touring and winter backpacking once winter arrives.</p>

<p>But let‚Äôs talk about warmth. Because that‚Äôs the first thing which comes to my mind when I think of this midlayer - it is ridiculously warm. The zig-zag pattern of the fabric allows for really big <em>‚Äúair gaps‚Äù</em> between the tufts of the hollow-core fabric, and these air gaps is what traps the air which your body heat warms up. In practice I believe these hollow core tufts are only there to keep the garment above your skin or baselayer, so that it can create this warm air field around you. It‚Äôs genius, really, and in combination with a wind jacket, hardshell or an insulation jacket it creates a double-sided, really warm layer of air around you. Because the zig-zag pattern is also on the outside, and so under a wind jacket or similar it creates another warm layer of air. I‚Äôm not getting tired of highlighting how amazing the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody</a> is as a windjacket, and it has surprised me to no small means how warm the R1 Air is in combination with that jacket in these cool temperatures. I can cycle with a T-Shirt, the r1 Air and the Alpine Start hoody, in November. Usually I‚Äôd wear a much warmer, heavier and thicker Midlayer + Insulation or Hardshell to not get cold!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583050181/in/dateposted/" title="Running away."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583050181_c593620c04_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Running away." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now on its own, or just over a T-Shirt or another baselayer, I will not use it. The thin fabric, so not the hollow-core tufts, but the cut-outs in-between them, well, they are nothing more than a mesh. You can see it in my Video above at the 4:21 mark really well, where I hold it into the sun and you can see right through it. In practice I have tried using it  on its own, but as I‚Äôm living at the coast we have always a wind blowing, and that wind goes right through the R1 Air and blows away your warm air field. Also when walking faster when in a windless forest I had the same effect - the air goes through it and takes the warmth away. Hence why I say this needs to be used with a jacket above it!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583169452/in/dateposted/" title="More close-ups."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583169452_52eafda0c6_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="More close-ups." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The tiny pocket on it, it‚Äôs good enough for a some <a href="https://trailbutter.eu">Trail Butter</a> pouches or a <a href="https://tidd.ly/3eQpKLn">‚àû Clifbar</a>, you also can fit some batteries in it, but other than that it is small.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583168492/in/album-72157716816476902/" title="Trail Butter Sized Pocket"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583168492_e50038346c_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Trail Butter Sized Pocket" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The big zipper is great for venting, which might be necessary during ascents or when hiking for a longer time. I find it is easy for me to run ‚Äútoo hot‚Äù with the R1 Air in the warm November temperatures, and having the possibility to vent allows me to still use it. Plus, when slowing down, reaching the summit, or pottering around at camp, I simply zip it back up and am toasty warm. The collar on the Zip-Neck is really nice, it closes high and replaces a Buff for me.</p>

<p>Finally, the fabric is supposed to wick sweat quickly away from the skin making for a dry feeling. Now I haven‚Äôt undertaken any really sweat-inducing activities with it yet besides day hikes with a light pack, and on these I had a dry feeling. But if it was because of the moisture-wicking capabilities of the fabric or because I didn‚Äôt sweat that much, I don‚Äôt dare say. The fabric does have a none-smelly HeiQ finish, which is eliminating bad odours and keeps the garment fresh. That‚Äôs probably really useful (if it works) on longer hikes and when you‚Äôre wearing the R1 Air day-in, day-out for a few weeks.</p>

<p>By the way - the R1 Air is also available as a no-frills <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/patagonia-womens-r1-air-crew-fleece-jumper/?pid=10239">‚àû Sweater</a> and a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/patagonia-r1-air-full-zip-hoody-fleece-jacket/?pid=10239">‚àû Full-Zip Hoody</a>. All three styles are available as Womens and Mens versions, in different colours. But the best colour is purple üòé</p>

<p>I have used this not enough to make some proper suggestions for improvement, but I have some things and features in mind which might make it better. First off are thumbloops. I‚Äôm a fan of these, and especially if gets cold it is nice to get more warmth to my hands with thumbloops. Then there‚Äôs the Pocket: I wonder if a larger pocket would make sense, or if maybe no pocket at all is better on the Zip-Neck (saving a tiny bit of weight)? Right now the Pocket is ok for some snacks or batteries, but even a Smartphone or a Notebook don‚Äôt fit in it. The question is if it needs to be any bigger - a map &amp; compass could go into the chest pocket of the jacket you wear over it, so what need is there for this pocket? It does well to keep snacks warm, though!</p>

<p>Finally, I wonder how durable the material will be. I fear it might be sensitive and only hold up for a few seasons, but it‚Äôs really too early to say this and in May 2021 I should know more about that.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583166172/in/dateposted/" title="Pocket."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583166172_0a5eb3ac78_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Pocket." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>It is too soon to call this warmest Midlayer I own just yet, but in the little time I have used it the R1 Air Zip-Neck really has made a very good impression on me. It is soooo warm (too warm for indoor use üòÜ), it is very comfortable on the skin, it is light, it is purple üíú and it has an 1A+ Environmental track record. I can not wait to take it skitouring and backpacking this winter, and see how warm I will be in it. My early use at least suggests that I won‚Äôt feel cold!</p>

<p><strong>If you too don‚Äôt want to feel cold</strong>, head over to <a href="https://bit.ly/3pe27Ru">‚àû Bergfreunde.eu</a> or <a href="https://tidd.ly/38O3AbN">‚àû¬†Bergzeit</a> to buy your own R1 Air when you‚Äôre in Europe. If you‚Äôre in North America, you can buy one from <a href="https://bit.ly/3qvdYKP">‚àû Patagonia</a>. Remember, all styles are available as <a href="https://tidd.ly/3pwXUsy">‚àû Women‚Äôs Versions</a> and <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/patagonia-womens-r1-air-crew-fleece-jumper/?pid=10239">‚àû in different colours</a> in case you don‚Äôt like purple =)</p>

<h2 id="day-1-echternach---rosport---moersdorf">Day 1: Echternach - Rosport - Moersdorf</h2>

<p>Monday morning 7:00 o‚Äôclock, rain is hitting the windows of our <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/tower-hamelmaous">medieval fortification tower</a> in which were are sleeping while staying in Echternach, Luxembourg. Martin and me get up, happy about all this dry space and the warmth inside - we have experienced these kinds of mornings very differently over the past ten years, and while we were sceptical about <em>‚Äúnot sleeping in a tent‚Äù</em> we really didn‚Äôt mind not having to pack up a wet shelter and gear this morning. Instead we sat in our warm &amp; dry kitchen, ate breakfast and then set off hiking <a href="https://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en/fiche/walking/stage-trail-mullerthal-trail-route-1">Route 1 of the Mullerthal Trail</a>. While bells of the church ring we start the hike from the centre of Echternach, the oldest town in Luxembourg.</p>

<p>We walk through the pretty Park just behind the Abbey and then along the river S√ªre, which is also the Border to Germany on the other side. The light drizzle isn‚Äôt a problem, and after around 2 km we leave the river behind and climb up into the forest. Here the real Mullerthal Trail starts. Right away we see impressive rock formations tower above our right while we hike towards Rosport, the first village along the trail today. But till there it are still many kilometres, and the drizzle is becoming a more steady rain. It‚Äôs time for me to don my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/200-g-hardshell-montane-podium-pull-on-and-pants.html">Montane Podium Pull-on &amp; Pants</a>, a procedure which will be done several times per day on this hike, depending on the intensity of the rain.</p>

<p>Everything is wet. And green. A vibrant, wet green üå≥ Except the rocks - these tower in various shades of grey and brown along the trail, though truth be told - many are also covered in green moss. Once in a while traffic noise comes through the trees from the street far beneath us, but there‚Äôs other sounds closer by: The dripping of the rain on the beech leafs. Bird song accompanies us while we wander through the green jungle. Small streams gurgle through their beds when they run over rocks. And that soft, wet sound when you walk through mud with your <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/la-sportiva-crossover-2-dot-0-gtx.html">shoes</a>.</p>

<p>Never far away is also one of the Mullerthal Trailblazes, a red M on a white background. Overall signs really aren‚Äôt an issue on the trail - it‚Äôs a Premium Trail after all, which means there‚Äôs supposed to be a Trailblaze every 250 m. Also other signs are in no short abundance to be seen, from Signposts which tell you how far it is to the next place to trail markers for the dozens of other local trails which criss-cross the Mullerthal Trail. Sometimes we encountered signposts which had markings for seven different trails on them, from MTB Trails over border-crossing trails to local loop trails - there‚Äôs no shortage of outdoor possibilities in this corner of Luxembourg, be it hiking, trailrunning or Mountain Biking.</p>

<p>We continue in a good mood on this pretty trail, and even when it really starts to pour down we smile about the beauty which surrounds us. Mighty, green beech trees üå≥üå≥üå≥ keep most of the rain at bay and act like a giant umbrella. A soft brown blanket of old leafs makes for comfortable hiking. And small details make me smile.</p>

<p>We reach Rosport after a couple of hours and take a peak into the village if we spot an open Caf√©, but no, there‚Äôs nothing to be seen. A large truck picks up milk from a local farmer as we hike out of Rosport, and we hope to get a short, dry moment in the Tudor Museum, but also it is closed. Ah well, happily I have some <a href="http://trailbutter.eu/">Trail Butter</a> with me, which I eat on the go.</p>

<p>We leave the forest behind for a moment and right at that time the wind starts to accelerate and hit us with its might - and the rain. We pass the Pilgrimage Chapel at Girsterklaus, and shortly ponder if we should try our luck and see if it is open, or simply continue. The rain and wind make the decision to search for some shelter easy, and much to our surprise and luck the Chapel is open - as is the toilet building in front of it! We wash our hands and disinfect them and look for the door to gain entry to the small Chapel.</p>

<p>Again we are in luck and find the Chapel open, and unoccupied. Better even, there‚Äôs a heating system blowing warm, dry air into the chapel, and we immediately sit down in front of it. We hang up rain jackets to dry a bit, snack some nuts, drink water. I wander around the Chapel, admiring the beautiful wooden carvings - some which are almost 500 years old.</p>

<p>As we set off a while later, the rain has stopped, and we also get back into the forest. A younger forest.</p>

<p>A forest next to open fields. In one of these we see a young deer, who is mighty unimpressed by us sneaking up on him to snap a photo.</p>

<p>Close to Moersdorf we pick some absolutely amazing tasty apples, plums and pears from the trees next to the trail. These <em>‚ÄúStreuobstwiesen‚Äù</em>, or mixed orchard meadows, are often to be found along the trail, and in this Region of Luxembourg they use the fruits to make juice, cider and tasty food from them. And for us wet and hungry hikers, they are a very welcome snack!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs around 15:15 when we reach the signpost which says it‚Äôs 700 m to Moersdorf, the village where we planned to stop. <em>But it‚Äôs so early</em> we talk with Martin, <em>should we still continue to Mompach or Herborn? Then we have less to hike tomorrow.</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469620127/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Almost in Echternach!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469620127_34f4528c3e_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Almost in Echternach!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the end we decide to stick to the original plan, and hike down to Moersdorf. We locate the Busstop right away and don‚Äôt even have to wait long, before the Bus back to Echternach arrives. Public Transportation in Luxembourg is free, for everyone. As someone who does not own a car and who uses public transportation (or my bike!) all the time to get around, this is something I obviously absolutely LOVE. Free, punctual public transportation, across the whole country. Fantastic! It‚Äôs a 20 minute ride back to Echternach, and then we walk back to our medieval fortification tower for a warm shower and dry clothes. Obviously it also stopped to rain now‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="day-2-moersdorf---herborn---echternach">Day 2: Moersdorf - Herborn - Echternach</h2>

<p>Which is not something one could say of the next morning. The rain hammers against the windows of our tower, and after the breakfast we walk to the bus station to return to Moersdorf and continue our hike. Despite us both wearing our waterproofs we don‚Äôt look happy or in a high mood. But it doesn‚Äôt take long and we stand at the bus stop in Moersdorf, so all we can do is continue to hike back to the trail up in the forest. Which we do. And the forest doesn‚Äôt last long. In fact, a look on the map says we‚Äôll be hiking out in the open for a considerable amount of time today. On a sunny, clear day one is supposed to have great views across the land from up here, but all we see are fields, windmills and the rain which is blowing into our faces.</p>

<p>Until the village of Mompach we pretty much are exposed to the wind and rain, so when we enter the forest after Mompach, and then see two Pavilions, we are very grateful for the possibility to get out of the elements for a moment. Martin brews us a coffee on his <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/primus-lite-gas-stove/?pid=10238">‚àû Primus Lite+</a>, and after some more nuts, chocolate and a hot coffee we are in a better mood. Also, it seems we now will be hiking for a while in the forest, and not out in the open between fields.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not a very photogenic weather, so we are fast. Less than an half an hour later we are seeing Herborn already, the next village which we will pass through.</p>

<p>Again there is no Caf√© in sight, so we simply pass through the village in the rain. Happily, just before the forest, there is another open hut with a bench, where we have another short break out of the rain. It is now so wet that I decide to put my camera into my backpack and use my new <a href="https://amzn.to/35fK8B2">‚àû GoPro HERO 9</a> to take photos and videos instead. It‚Äôs not something I would usually do, as I see my equipment as a tool that needs to survive these harsh conditions, but I also didn‚Äôt want to risk it to get even more soaked on the 2nd day of the trip.</p>

<p>Happily at some point the rain decided to make a short break, and we also were again in a forest. A pretty, vibrant green beech forest.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469275651/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="M"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469275651_e780818e5d_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="M" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>These last few kilometres of Route 1 were again enjoyable. We were in a good mood, here, in this üå≥ green forest. We made jokes. Laughed. Had another break, in another hut.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469438292/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Bench and Hut and Bin"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469438292_62bee33dc0_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Bench and Hut and Bin" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then we saw Echternach.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469281436/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Echternach"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469281436_268218a6af_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Echternach" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The forest road became a pretty path.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469439872/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Still down"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469439872_d4db696ccd_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Still down" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Slippery, yes. But better than an asphalt road between open fields.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469442542/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Jakobsweg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469442542_5531927d04_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Jakobsweg" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then we were back in Echternach, at the lake. Together with the rain.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50468586188/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Swan"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50468586188_a73ba9cfb9_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Swan" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Our conclusion of Route 1</strong> is that the first section from Echternach to Moersdorf via Rosport is a beautiful section (according to my Suunto Spartan Ultra GPS it were 20 km) through beautiful forests and along intriguing rock formations. The Chapel in Girsterklaus is pretty and does make for a good break spot, the apple, pear and plum trees which occasionally are next to the trail are in the autumn full of tasty fruits, and there‚Äôs some really scenic trail section.</p>

<p><em>Now for the section from Moersdorf to Herborn and back to Echternach‚Ä¶</em> I would not hike it if you‚Äôre not a completionist who is hunting for the title of <em>‚ÄúI hiked the complete Mullerthal Trail‚Äù</em>. Maybe in sunny and warm weather the asphalt &amp; forest roads next to fields are enjoyable, but in the rain they were not. Martin and I both agreed that it would have made more sense to completely skip the 2nd part of Route 1 and hike on Route 2, which is the absolute highlight route of the Mullerthal Route with an amazing scenery spot every kilometre.</p>

<p>We were lucky that there were huts on the second day in which we could get a small break from the rain and wind, but this section was such a stark contrast to the beautiful forest part on Day 1 that we felt a bit let down. But then we had another four amazing hiking days on the Mullerthal Trail, so don‚Äôt worry üòÅ! Trip Reports from Route 2 and 3 will follow in short order.</p>

<h2 id="practicalities---where-to-stay-what-to-eat-and-how-to-get-around">Practicalities - Where to Stay, What to Eat and How to get Around</h2>

<p>We stayed at the start and the end of our trip in Echternach, which is a small town - the oldest in Luxembourg - which we really liked. We stayed the first three nights in the <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/tower-hamelmaous">medieval fortification tower H√§melmaous</a> which really was a beautiful experience. There‚Äôs a cozy kitchen at the ground floor, and then there‚Äôs four more floors in this round tower. It easily should sleep a family of four or more, and it‚Äôs also really close to the centre and the bus stop. At the end of our trip we slept in a <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/sleeping-like-diogenes">Wooden Barrel</a> on the Campground, which was a really cozy experience as well. I slept like a stone in my barrel, which is good for one to two persons and possibly a small child or two. The camping place is a wee bit outta town - some five to ten minutes of walking to the centre, but really close to the trail.</p>

<p>We ate every evening in the <a href="https://aaleechternoach.lu/">Restaurant Aal Eechternoach</a>, which we picked because of the positive reviews it had on Google Maps - and as we went there every evening you probably understand that they also have good food =) They use a lot of local ingredients and also serve local beverages - the local apple juice was delicious, as were all their Vegan offerings. Martin ate the best Cordon Bleu of his life here, and it did look really very good indeed. There‚Äôs a small supermarket not far from the tower, and a few smaller ones on the main shopping street, where there‚Äôs also a nice wee bakery which had good baked goods.</p>

<p>As I wrote above: <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/en/timetables-and-lines/bus/">Public bus transportation in Luxembourg</a> is free. Jump on a bus to get from one corner of the country to the other one (it‚Äôs a small country, so easy to do). The busses are plentiful and seem to stop even in the smallest villages, so hiking the Mullerthal Trail (or any other trail for that matter) in sections is easy to do.</p>

<p>Days get shorter, mushrooms and berries are everywhere in the forests, and of course the trees start to be their prettiest üçÅüçÇ Autumn is my favourite time of the year, and the possibility to share this special season with my family at the <a href="https://www.rokua.com">Rokua Health &amp; Spa Hotel</a> was very welcome, despite the busy times we usually have between the end of summer and the Holidays. So early on a Friday morning we packed our one <a href="https://tidd.ly/3o1B1wu">‚àû Arc‚Äôteryx V110 Rolling Duffel</a> into a loaned car and started the drive North to Rokua. It is situated a wee bit from Oulu, and it was a beautiful, scenic drive along colourful trees to our destination.</p>

<p>We arrived early in the afternoon at the Hotel, checked in and then went to see both our room and the Kids Playroom. The Playroom was definitely a ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è facility, not only did they have toys for kids of all ages (and for both boys and girls equally!), but they also had a small Movie Theatre, a game room with XBoxes &amp; PlayStations, lots of board games and what our kids enjoyed the most, the little ‚Äúgym‚Äù. Over the course of the weekend our two kids never got tired to go play here, and it definitely did set the bar really high for future hotel visits.</p>

<p>Since I learned to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/active-holidays-in-are-sweden.html">Downhill MTB in √Öre</a> a few years ago I really love to ride bikes on Single Trails in the forest and hills. Mountain biking in Rokua is really enjoyable, as there‚Äôs a dedicated Team of locals who establish and maintain a superb trail network, and also in the <a href="https://www.rokuageopark.fi/en/experience">Rokua GeoPark</a> and the <a href="https://www.nationalparks.fi/rokuanp">Rokua National Park</a> you are allowed to drive on marked MTB Trails.</p>

<p>Hannu rode a short 15 km loop with me, showing me a lot of beautiful, scenic spots along the way. From a Kota and a Laavu, to silent lakes which are surrounded by yellow birches, and lovely little trails through the GeoPark, I had a big smile on my face riding with Hannu, and really thankful that he went out with me. During the weekend he went on to coach a course at the Hotel about Mountain biking, and I am certain the participants came away with an equally big passion for riding on forest trails as him.</p>

<p>If you want to see more MTBing in Rokua, you should go watch my <a href="https://youtu.be/9UaMahrgToc">Video from Rokua</a> where there‚Äôs quite a bit of footage of riding - this was the first test of my new <a href="https://amzn.to/35fK8B2">‚àû GoPro HERO 9</a> and I have to say that the image stabilization is pretty amazing!</p>

<p>On Saturday it was my turn to take care of the kids during the morning and afternoon, as M joined a Mushroom course. Having two people in the family who can identify mushrooms is better than one person, and M enjoyed the company and instructions at the course. Every participant got a small mushroom knife and a basket, and then they set off into the forest around the Hotel to collect. The Guide was around to help with identifying, but at the end the group went to the Kota next to the Hotel, where they went through all the mushrooms everyone had collected, and the Instructor explained what are the really delicious mushrooms, tasty mushrooms, edible mushrooms, and mushrooms you shouldn‚Äôt pick or eat üçÑ After that the instructor prepared a tasty dish from the really delicious mushrooms the whole group had collected!</p>

<p>While M was at the course the kids and me packed our <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/09/huckepacks-phoenix-lite-review.html">backpacks</a> and went for a short hike. I am very happy that our two kids like to go hiking - and they especially like it if there‚Äôs a üî• and marshmallows involved! We hiked a small loop, and used what would be the XC skiing loipe in winter for the way to the Jaakonj√§rvi Laavu. It‚Äôs an easy trail with some good views, but on the way back we decided to hike on and next to the abandoned rail track. This was a lot more fun and we saw more - more reindeer moss, more mushrooms, more berries and even a lovely orange-coloured swamp, as well as plenty of nice, little side trails.</p>

<p>At the Laavu I made a fire, we drunk hot juice and while the kids explored the surroundings I prepared them their sticks for grilling their marshmallows. It‚Äôs funny how such a small extra - molten sugar, basically! - can make from a simple hike a very memorable little trip.</p>

<p>The afternoon all four of us met up again, and we went together to the Spa and swimming pools. Our kids love to play in the water, and with a Sauna next door it is easy to go warm up in between swimming and so stay longer in the water!</p>

<p>Early on Sunday morning, after we had breakfast together, I sneaked out for another little MTB trip. This time I decided I wanted to ride to the southern-most Kota which could be reached on the cycling trails, at Rokuanj√§rvi. It was easy to follow the yellow dots of the MTB Trail from the Hotel till the Kota, where I met two young women which had camped out here. It‚Äôs a beautiful, scenic spot and I was happy they had a wee fire going and welcomed me inside, so I could drink a bit of water.</p>

<p>We chatted about cycling and hiking at Rokua National park and GeoPark, and then I said Farewell and cycled back to the Hotel - it was time to check-out and head home, after all. I filmed a lot with my <a href="https://amzn.to/35fK8B2">‚àû new GoPro HERO 9</a>, and looking at the footage I am really amazed about this small camera, and can‚Äôt wait to take it skiing and packrafting! But that will be another story =)</p>

<p>While the kids enjoyed the last moments at the Playroom I packed up and got everything into the car, happy that we have an <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/06/ultralight-family-travel-with-eagle-creek.html">organized and lightweight packing approach</a> when we travel. That way packing is a breeze and soon we were on the way back south.</p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that we had a relaxing and adventurous family weekend at the <a href="https://www.rokua.com">Rokua Health &amp; Spa Hotel</a> and are ready for the remaining busy autumn! With its location right in the middle of the National Park and GeoPark - the only of its kind in Finland, by the way! - we could walk out of the Rokua Health &amp; Spa Hotel and be right in the middle of nature. Hiking, mushroom picking, Mountain biking, Trailrunning: It‚Äôs right in front of the door. As is a Playground, an Adventure Trail for kids, a lake in which you can go rowing, swimming and fishing, and in case the weather is not ideal for outdoor adventures: Stay indoors! With the modern Spa and swimming pool facilities, as well as the large gym, and not to forget the Kids Playroom you don‚Äôt have a reason to sit on your room when it rains outside. So if you too need a relaxing weekend away to recharge your body &amp; mind - head to Rokua!</p>

<p>Six years ago I hiked the Escapardenne Eislek Trail from Kautenbach in Luxembourg to La Roche-en-Ardenne in Belgium, and as I was fast back then (I was several years younger and carried less photo equipment üòÅ) I finished a day early and hence made a short trip to Berdorf and explored the local climbing crag and hiking trails. Since then I always wanted to go back to this corner of Luxembourg, and hike the <a href="https://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en">Mullerthal Trail</a>. Despite the on-going Pandemic I managed to fly to Germany, briefly visit my family and then travel by train and bus to Echternach in Luxembourg.</p>

<p>Together with my best friend Martin we were here to hike the complete Mullerthal Trail. There was just one problem: The weather forecast was wet. Wet as in <em>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna rain the next nine days‚Äù</em> wet. Happily it didn‚Äôt end up raining all the time, but you‚Äôll have to wait for that story in the detailed trip report later this month! For now I want to share some of my favourite impressions from this 112 km long trail with it‚Äôs three Routes:</p>

<p>You will be able to see some more photos on <a href="https://instagram.com/hendrikmorkel/">Instagram</a> this week before the article comes, so maybe give me a follow üòâ (and check out the Story Highlight Videos from the trail while you‚Äôre there!)! And if you can‚Äôt wait: The beech trees were still a vibrant green and just starting to put on their autumn üçÇ colours on as we left, so at least till the start of November you should be able to enjoy here the most beautiful autumn colours, in combination with the amazing rock formations and the very well marked trail!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you head outdoors in the city or have to travel, one thing is clear: You should be wearing a face mask. But instead of a disposable mask you should invest into a reuseable face mask. For yourself, and for the environment. Short on money? Then check out how I made a mask from an old T-Shirt, without sewing!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.christownsendoutdoors.com/2020/09/face-masks-reusable-not-disposable.html">As Chris wrote</a>: <em>‚ÄúWe all are, or at least should be, wearing Face Masks when out in Public.‚Äù</em> Right when this Pandemic kicked off Face Masks were hard to get by, and back in April I made from an old T-Shirt face masks for the whole family. This was super easy as the only thing one needed was a ruler, a pencil and scissors. I followed this <a href="https://youtu.be/K3mOrhxGiIU">simple Video</a> for those, and shortly later had four re-useable face masks which could be washed.</p>

<p>The DIY face mask from an old Patagonia T-Shirt has served me well over the past six months when I went grocery shopping. But in anticipation of an upcoming trip to Germany &amp; Luxembourg I decided I need to make a smarter impression on the Airport staff, and so I ordered for the whole family the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/maloja-mund-nasen-maske-printed-reusable/?pid=10239">‚àû reuseable Face masks from Maloja</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50403155838/in/dateposted/" title="Maloja Face Mask, Front"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50403155838_98e11f2f99_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Maloja Face Mask, Front" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>It fits well over my beard, is easy to take off for eating or drinking, all without touching the front of the mask.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50403858236/in/dateposted/" title="Maloja Face Mask, off"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50403858236_eb76fbcf3f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Maloja Face Mask, off" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Maloja mask is Made in Europe, and has three layers: An inner and outer layer of a breathable functional fabric (Polyester), which is comfortable on the skin and allows me to breath normally. Between these two layers is a fleece insert which acts as a droplet filter. Finally, it has a Polygiene ViralOff finish, which <em>reduces viruses by 99% in two hours</em> [<a href="https://polygiene.com/viraloff/">Source</a>]. The mask has an adjustable nose bow and elastic straps for easily securing it around your head and neck. Also with my short beard it closes completely around the face and you can wear glasses and hearing aids with it, as the straps don‚Äôt interfere with these. The face mask is washable at 40 - 60 ¬∞C, although the effect of ViralOff slightly wears off after approx. 20 washes.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50403858026/in/dateposted/" title="Viral Off"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50403858026_7db3717f39_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Viral Off" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The best thing about the Maloja Face Masks is that they were made with people in mind who want to do sports. Mainly indoor sports, in a gym, where you can maybe not practice social distancing very well. I found them really breathable indeed, and like Chris in his article I will always now carry one when I go outdoors, as in cold wind or when it snows it also keep the face warm, while allowing me to breath comfortably!</p>

<p>The Maloja face masks come either in a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/maloja-face-mask-reusable/?pid=10239">‚àû uni colour</a> which then cost around 10‚Ç¨ for one or with <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/maloja-mund-nasen-maske-printed-reusable/?pid=10239">‚àû different prints</a> which then cost between 13 and 16‚Ç¨ depending on where you buy them. There‚Äôs also a <a href="https://tidd.ly/34e0CJp">‚àû kids mask</a> available. I bought our masks at <a href="https://www.camu.fi/maloja-reusable-mask-printed/14448#4">Camu</a>, but also <a href="https://tidd.ly/3cKxr4C">‚àû Bergzeit</a> and <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/maloja-mund-nasen-maske-printed-reusable/?pid=10239">‚àû Bergfreunde</a> have them and send them fast &amp; cheap around the globe. With two of these I now feel ready to travel south!</p>

<p>Last week Friday we drove early in the morning North. North to Rokua. While in Vaasa only the maple trees have started to turn yellow, orange and red, up in Rokua my favourite season was already in full swing, and Birch trees stood in golden Dresses along the trails and lakes. It was beautiful.</p>

<p>We spent the weekend at the <a href="https://www.rokua.com/en">Rokua Health &amp; Spa Hotel</a>, which is located right in the middle of the Rokua GeoPark. From there we were able to go explore the surroundings easily.</p>

<p>We were both hiking and Mountain Biking, as there‚Äôs a superb MTB Trail Network in the area. I was lucky enough to have Hannu show me around on Friday afternoon, and M took part in a Mushroom Course on Saturday while I went hiking with the kids.</p>

With the Anfibio REBEL 2K the Packrafting Store has launched a packraft which is ideal for both absolute packrafting beginners and seasoned packrafters, too! It‚Äôs versatile in use and it‚Äôs compact pack size and light weight make it a dream for remote backpacking - packrafting trips!</p>

<p>A ridiculously small pack size and a weight of around 2 kg make the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/Anfibio-packrafts/Anfibio-Rebel-2K::889.html?language=en">Anfibio Rebel 2K</a> an absolute dream to carry on backpacking trips, especially if you go off-trail over the hills. On the water the Rebel 2K shows that it‚Äôs not a kids toy: You can run rapids in it, with the optional skeg you paddle large water bodies more efficiently and faster, and the tube bags are amazing to store your gear while paddling, without having a backpack in front of your eyes! <a href="https://youtu.be/Xp3Pkxnl_po">Watch the Video</a> to see it in action:</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>The Rebel 2K arrived in March 2020 with me, and I have used it for paddling on lakes and rivers, paddling in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/bjorko-panike-trail.html">Kvarken Archipelago</a> and I paddled <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/impressions-from-lemmenjoki-and-ivalojoki.html">80 km on the Ivalojoki</a> in Lapland. It has seen a lot of use, and the season isn‚Äôt over yet!</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> The Anfibio Rebel 2K you see in this Review and Video is an early version (late 2019), and since then some things have been changed (e.g. the handle on the inside has been removed) and other details further improved.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The idea of a packraft was to allow you to ferry across large rivers and water bodies in remote areas. Nowadays packrafts are a sport on itself, and are used to run difficult, hard white water rapids, in Adventure Races, for fishing and also for trekking and relaxed paddling! Packrafts are inflated with an inflation bag and have one (rarely more) large air chamber. They are light weight - anything from 500 g to 5 kg or more.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50348476217/in/photostream/" title="Anfibio Rebel 2K"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50348476217_f790f2d211_b.jpg" width="1024" height="575" alt="Anfibio Rebel 2K" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>My Anfibio Rebel 2K with the optional tube bags weighs all in 2430 gram. Included in that weight is also the special Anfibio Rebel 2K Comfort Seat, which is 295 g, and the Anfibio DeckPack with 225 g. Not included, but useful to take along on large lake crossings, is the Anfibio Skeg, which is 85 g light. And obviously you also need the inflation bag, which is 108 g. You also need a paddle, PFD and a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/petzl-meteor-helmet-climbing-helmet/?pid=10239">‚àû Helmet</a> if you want to paddle rapids.</p>

<p>The features, according to the Packrafting Store:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spacious, 37 cm wide inner with great foot space</li>
  <li>J-shaped Spraydeck which can be rolled to the side, making it an open boat</li>
  <li>Optional TubeBags for transport of your gear inside of the packraft</li>
  <li>Fin Mount for the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Accessories/Anfibio-Skeg::691.html">optional Skeg</a></li>
  <li>Included Comfort Seat</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Designing such a playful, versatile and lightweight yet durable packraft is an innovation, yes. You have to be more careful on low water, but with normal care and the intended use this packraft should last you long!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50352518397/in/dateposted/" title="Salamander"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50352518397_a2a08fe110_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Salamander" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The Packraft is Made in China, and this helps with it‚Äôs quality. Not many Western countries have access to the skilled labour force, the materials or tools necessary to produce such high quality packrafts which still do not cost a fortune. I found the quality, looking at the complete package, to be great. As the Packrafting Store gives an extended 3 year Warranty on the Rebel 2K, I imagine they are also convinced that it is a quality product!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50352667302/in/dateposted/" title="Read Carefully"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50352667302_ea11dfc50e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Read Carefully" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>As the packraft is Made in China it means it has to be transported by sea to Europe or elsewhere, and also labour and environmental standards are still lower in China than in Europe. On the other hand, most other packraft manufacturers also use materials which are made in China. I didn‚Äôt find a mention about sustainability or similar on the Packrafting Store website, which is something which could be addressed. In use a packraft is a long-lasting item, and always can be repaired, so I am not sure if the topic of recyclability is needed.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <em>I found this <a href="https://www.transa.ch/marken/anfibio/">short information</a> (in German) about the materials, recyclability and fair pay. The Packrafting-Store.de also reached out to inform me that their packrafts, which are Made in China, are transported via a land route to Europe, and not via sea!</em></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I absolutely am in love with the light weight of my Anfibio Rebel 2K packraft setup. Together with the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Paddle/Classic-paddles/Anfibio-Wave::875.html?language=en">920 g light Anfibio Wave paddle</a>, the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Accessories/Anfibio-Buoy-Boy::950.html">Anfibio BuoyBoy Vest</a> and my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/petzl-sirocco-helmet-climbing-helmet/?pid=10239">‚àû Petzl Helmet</a> I have a packrafting setup which weighs around 4,5 kg. However, more important for me is the compact pack size which fits easily into or on top of a <a href="https://bit.ly/3l5QkTA">‚àû Hyperlite Mountain Gear SouthWest 3400 pack</a> or the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/09/huckepacks-phoenix-lite-review.html">HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite</a>. Having such a compact packraft setup, which also is able to run Class II or more rapids, is immensely useful for me as it allows me to go more off-the-beaten track and run more remote waters.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50137014122/in/album-72157715182503422/" title="Summit Selfie V2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50137014122_2de7abcf10_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit Selfie V2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I found the Rebel 2K to perform well in rapids up to Class II+ with a good amount of water. The raft is agile and it‚Äôs easy to get it to go where I want it to go, and it also breaks well through waves. It‚Äôs OK in turning into an eddy or easy surfing, and I never capsized in it - it‚Äôs a pretty wide boat, and then packrafts generally are difficult to capsize. I haven‚Äôt tried doing an Eskimo roll in it, as I don‚Äôt have thigh straps, but you could install those for getting even more control over the raft and doing rolls. I used my legs, pushing against the inner tubes, for control, which worked good. I think also beginners will feel confident in this packraft, when running their first white water (as confident one can feel when one is for the first time running white water!)</p>

<p>The Spraydeck is a bit of a weak point for me, though - the Velcro closure will at some point let some water through, and I can‚Äôt get the Chimney to close reasonably well around my chest which means it will slide down after a while of paddling. I maybe simply should sew on some shoulder straps to solve this issue ü§î (<strong>Edit:</strong> <em>The Spraycdeck + Chimney has been improved in current models, and should be better than mine, which is a packraft from the first batch.</em>) I also had some water pool on the Spraydeck after especially big waves, but simply pushing my knees and the Chimney up got the water off the boat. If I don‚Äôt need the Spraydeck it‚Äôs stowed away in a minute, neatly rolled and strapped to the side, making it an open boat. This is ideal for only crossing water bodies.</p>

<p>The Comfort seat which comes with the raft is good and comfortable, but the strap which you use to connect the seat to the raft ripped out of the seat after a day on the water - that should probably get a better, more durable seam in the future. In use I found this great, as that way I could take the seat easily out to inflate + deflate and use it in camp for sitting. Inflating the seat is hard work - the valve needs strong lungs to inflate, and deflating it is also not my favourite part of a trip, but practice makes perfect. Overall the cockpit of the raft is really generous - 37 cm width on the inside is plenty for me, and I can sit with legs completely stretched out in the boat. There‚Äôs a lot of space for my feet and legs, which allows me to move around to switch positions.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50137008647/in/album-72157715182503422/" title="Final Camp"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50137008647_fb866210fe_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Final Camp" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On calm lakes, the sea and slow-flowing rivers the Rebel 2K performed flawlessly, especially with the Fin mounted and the wind in the back. I was able to paddle 4 to 5 km an hour with it under such conditions, but even paddling into 10 m/s wind I paddled 2 km in an hour. I do feel it is best suited for paddling on rivers with a good flow - or then that‚Äôs what I prefer, as it‚Äôs less work with good speed ü§£</p>

<p>At the start of my Ivalojoki trip I got a <em>tiny</em> puncture into the main tube after I was sliding over gravel in some really low water sections (I should have simply got out and walk it, but I didn‚Äôt want to get wet feet üò¨) and it drove me insane - I spent two evenings looking for an hour each for the hole, without success. On the third day on the water I by coincidence found it and was able to fix it, which gave me peace of mind. I also would recommend anyone who wants to buy a Rebel 2K to order a set of <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Repairs-stuff/Anfibio-LifePatch::804.html">LifePatches</a> with the raft, as strangely there‚Äôs some repair fabrics coming with the raft but nothing to attach them with. That tiny puncture wasn‚Äôt bad, I had to inflate the packraft every hour with two, three puffs to get it again fully inflated, but it still was something that made me feel uneasy when running the more demanding rapids - something which I could have avoided completely if I‚Äôd remember my Rule #1: <em>‚ÄúNever slide with your packraft over gravel banks!‚Äù</em>. So, learn from my mistakes, and do it better!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50351661393/in/dateposted/" title="Anfibio Rebel 2K Bottom damage"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50351661393_bb41abdf16_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Anfibio Rebel 2K Bottom damage" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Finally, the optional Tube Bags. Well, <em>optional</em> only if you are not going to do long paddling trips with the raft, and as you‚Äôre reading this review chances are that is exactly what you have in mind. So take the Rebel 2K <strong>with TubeBags</strong>. It‚Äôs so much better than strapping the backpack with all your gear to the front of the boat, it limiting your view on the water and the possibility to transport your bike on it. I love the TubeBags. They are so easy to use, and 70 l of Volume per Tube Bag is ridiculously large. I could fit the complete content of my backpack in there, all the camera gear, and the backpack itself. It‚Äôs fantastic. You need to plan what you need throughout the day, as you can not open the TubeBags when the raft is inflated (doing that will break the TubeBags), so pack your stove, coffee and lunch into the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Accessories/Anfibio-DeckPack::808.html">DeckPack</a> and you‚Äôre good to paddle the whole day without going hungry or decaffeinated.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50137010432/in/dateposted/" title="Full Deck Pack"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50137010432_91b0434902_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Full Deck Pack" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>Durability versus lightness, it‚Äôs the Battle of Eternity. In one of the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/MRS-packrafts:::43_65.html">MRS Packrafts</a> I can slide over gravel all day long without much of a problem - but then it is almost double as heavy as the Rebel 2K, and also a lot bigger in pack size. And as my packrafting style is more of a <em>‚ÄúHiking in the hills and then paddling‚Äù</em> the Rebel 2K suits me much better, as it makes the hiking and backpacking part of the trip more enjoyable. Nevertheless, I wish the Rebel 2K could be a tad more durable, while still being just as light. I also would wish for a better Chimney on the spraydeck, or a way that it gets tighter on top and doesn‚Äôt slide down so easily. I know that this is a problem which only really slim people like me will have, but this is my review, and I can wish here for things that better suit me üòÜ</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/phoenix-lite/">HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite</a> is a 50 l Volume backpack which carries ridiculously comfortable up to 10 kg, and that for a weight of under 300 g. Add in the ZLite backpanel and the Hipbelt Plus and you can carry even more weight, in more comfort. It‚Äôs unique Accordion closure makes accessing the content easy without opening the rolltop, and gives this stylish pack a clean, functional look. It is ideal for backpackers who already have a base weight of four to five kilogram and are familiar with the ideas of ultralight backpacking. Watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/3tV8alDSVMo">Video</a> to see the pack in action:</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I received my Phoenix Lite in August 2019, and it has been with me <a href="https://youtu.be/-AYVkZf61UE">backpacking in Hammastunturi Wilderness</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/vPzDSYp71I4">hiking &amp; packrafting the Bj√∂rk√∂-Panike Trail</a> and on many shorter trips around Vaasa.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>This <strong>ULTRALIGHT</strong> backpack is made to enable your outdoor adventures without carrying a gram too much. It does carry really damn comfortable, though =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48744082458/in/album-72157710871736122/" title="Hammastunturi Wilderness"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48744082458_873ca178ee_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hammastunturi Wilderness" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>My Phoenix Lite with a Medium back length weighs 296 g including all straps. Together with the optional <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/hipbelt-plus-lite/">Hipbelt Plus Lite</a> (Size S, 57 g/ Pair), one <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/hipbelt-pocket/">Hipbelt Pocket</a> (44 g) and the ZLite back panel (4 Segments, 106 g) it weighs 474 g.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>As the Phoenix Lite is so light, you could imagine it doesn‚Äôt have a lot of features. Well, that‚Äôs not the case - here is its long list of features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ergonomic S-Shaped Shoulder Straps with Daisy Chains on them</li>
  <li>Adjustable and removable chest strap</li>
  <li>Two really good side pockets</li>
  <li>One large stretchy front pocket</li>
  <li>Side compression straps to minimize the Volume on the Pack</li>
  <li>Inside and Outside attachment possibilities for the included <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/therm-a-rest-z-lite-sleeping-mat/?pid=10239">‚àû ZLite Mattress</a>, which functions as back cushioning</li>
  <li>The optional Hipbelt Plus lets you carry up to 12 kg in the pack</li>
  <li>And finally the Extension Collar with the innovative Accordion closure</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>The Accordion closure of the Rolltop closure is a HUCKEPACKS innovation and makes your roll-top backpack look clean, with easier and less noisy access to the inside.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50327293976/in/dateposted/" title="Rolltop Closure, Top View"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50327293976_5e3cd40046_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Rolltop Closure, Top View" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>Hand-made in Germany, from the highest-quality and lightest materials available. The quality is absolutely topnotch, and I expect this pack to last me many years =)</p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>HUCKEPACKS produces in a small workshop in Cologne (you can <a href="https://youtu.be/7oWBgnSEBMY">see it in this interview</a>) where the materials are cut and sewn together to create their ultralight packs and accessories. During cutting attention is paid to minimize waste, and also otherwise they try to minimize waste during production. The packs being made from DCFW or DxG I am not certain about what their recyclability is, but the life-cycle of the backpacks is long with normal, good care.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>As always, this is the most important part of the whole article - get a cup of coffee ‚òïÔ∏è or tea üçµ and then read on.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/jw76p2" title="Breaking Camp"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50327526877_bb4e5ea3f8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Breaking Camp" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite is the lighter brother of the <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/phoenix/">Phoenix DxG</a>, and the Lite is made from black Dyneema Composite Fabric Woven (what we called cuben back in the day) in different strengths. The material is waterproof, the pack isn‚Äôt however - because the seams aren‚Äôt taped. In reality I haven‚Äôt had any rain/ water get into the pack, and the material is durable and has survived bushwhacking and heavier loads without problem thus far.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50327464042/in/dateposted/" title="HUCKEPACKS"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50327464042_756c9af547_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="HUCKEPACKS" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>COM. FORT. ABLE.</strong> I really love how comfortable this pack carries. The four segments of the ZLite, which function as the backpanel on the ergonomically designed back of the pack, are really pleasant on my back. And if you‚Äôre not a fan of it you also could use a different mattress or none at all, if you for example use the Burrito Frame packing method. I do get a sweaty back, but I do get that pretty much with every backpack I use. With food for 5 days, a tripod and camera gear the pack was really comfortable to carry all day long.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50327462992/in/photostream/" title="Shoulder Strap &amp; Back Pad 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50327462992_e7e4e47633_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Shoulder Strap &amp; Back Pad 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I always have loved the shoulder straps Mateusz has on his backpacks, and these are no different. They are really well designed and with a good, ergonomic fit that carries also heavier loads in comfort, and most importantly: I can attach my <a href="https://bit.ly/3bKwoRH">‚àû Peak Design Capture V3 Clip</a> on them, for easy access to my camera. The shoulder straps are made from a 3D Mesh and Copolymer foam, in different thicknesses which makes them soft &amp; flexible and they adapt well to you body, while at the same time transferring the weight really well, ensuring a comfortable carry.</p>

<p>The Side pockets are spacious, and I can grab my water bottle while hiking, which I really appreciate, and there‚Äôs also space for more stuff, like my tripod, a Kuksa and my chili nuts. The front mesh pocket is big enough to fit in a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/09/hyperlite-mountain-gear-dirigo-2.html">large shelter</a> or my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/200-g-hardshell-montane-podium-pull-on-and-pants.html">rain gear</a> in there without problems.</p>

<p>The Hipbelt Plus Lite which I have with the pack suits my style better - I‚Äôm not a fan of the simple 20 mm hipbelt strap it comes with, and feel the Hipbelt Plus Lite is a good alternative for me. It wraps around my narrow hips nicely, and transfers the weight really well. Also long days with 10 to 12 kg are not problem, which is often the weight I carry at the start of a trip with all my camera gear, food and water.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50326623528/in/dateposted/" title="HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite Hipbelt Plus"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50326623528_fb3a9a2d9d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite Hipbelt Plus" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then finally, the collar and Accordion closure of the Phoenix Lite. Some of you might remember the original <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/first-look-laufbursche-huckepack.html">Laufbursche Huckepacks backpack</a>, which already had a very innovative closure that ensured that no water can get inside the pack. With the Phoenix Mateus went for a classic Toploader design with a rolltop closure ‚Äì but the rolltop closure has a twist - actually, more a fold =) The Accordion closure gives this pack a really clean appearance as it folds the material, which in other backpacks comes out at the sides, to the inside. I imagine this adds to the durability of the pack, but it definitely makes it easier to get things from the inside, as you don‚Äôt even have to open the small hook as you can grab past it inside. No noisy Velcro which keeps it together, but a clean, minimalistic and durable way to close the top. I love it.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>From a design perspective I understand why the Phoenix Lite‚Äôs main body is 40 l Volume and not more, but I have on the start of my trips often found that I‚Äôd wish the pack had 5 or 10 l more Volume. The simple reason is that in addition to the backpacking kit and food I also carry camera gear which can range in Volume anywhere between one and ten litres. Especially at the start of a trip, when there‚Äôs food for seven days along, it‚Äôs for me really hard to figure out how I get my camera stuff inside. This is a problem which likely not many will have, but I wish that somehow the pack would have a wee bit more Volume so I could fit my camera gear easier inside (I solve this problem usually by having the camera stuff in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/05/huckepacks-beipack.html">beiPACK</a>!).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50327283211/in/photostream/" title="Tripod on the right, beiPACK, Camera Gear and Phoenix Lite"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50327283211_08a9d35cf3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tripod on the right, beiPACK, Camera Gear and Phoenix Lite" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I also would like to lose the grommet in the bottom. I haven‚Äôt had any water come inside through it, but similarly I never had to drain the inside of my pack. But I see as a possibility for moisture/ water to get inside the pack when I set it down where it is wet.</p>

<p>Finally, I‚Äôd like the side compression go the complete length of the pack. Now it only compress the upper 2/3 of the pack, and not the bottom, and I‚Äôd wish that the side compression straps would be more like on the <a href="https://ula-equipment.9xrw.net/P3qZN">‚àû ULA Ohm</a>, which has from all the backpacks I have used in the past 20+ years the best side compression system.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I love how clean the pack looks when packed - there‚Äôs nothing superfluous on there, just a functional, beautiful pack which carries extremely well. And while I find it sometimes hard to fit everything I need to have along on a trip (as you can see above) it is a spacious pack for week-long trips. One thing I really appreciate and like is that a full pack doesn‚Äôt ride above my shoulders. Usually the pack stops on the same line as my shoulders, which is from an ergonomics point-of-view for me really good. It also gives usually the impression that one is on a day trip, as the pack is so small üòÜ All in all this is my go-to pack when I‚Äôm heading outdoors, and I‚Äôm looking forward to many more great trips with this durable, beautiful, comfortable and well-designed pack. Also, make sure to see my detailed <a href="https://youtu.be/3tV8alDSVMo">HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite Review Video</a> to see what I carry in the pack and all the details in action!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>#NukuY√∂Ulkona</strong> is an event from Suomen Latu, which inspires people in Finland (and elsewhere =) to sleep a night outside! This year I took the kids and our new family tent along, and we spent a beautiful afternoon, night and morning outside in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Kvarken Archipelago!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50289199008/in/dateposted/" title="L√•nggrund"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50289199008_eaf9ec5722_b.jpg" width="1024" height="575" alt="L√•nggrund" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Packing for three is 3 times as complicated as packing for one - but as long as three spoons, three Kuksas and one stove, as well as Marshmallows, are along, nothing can go wrong! Seriously though, I had to make a list to make sure we had everything along on our hiking and camping trip for the #NukuY√∂Ulkona Challenge. I also made them carry some gear - the older one a bit more, but even the small one carried 2 l of fresh water, her book and sleeping buddy for the whole 3,5 km without complaints!</p>

<p>I decided to take my small kids to Kvarken, and camp with them at L√•nggrundet, which is the fire and campsite I explored earlier in the year when I was <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/bjorko-panike-trail.html">packrafting here</a>. The trip had everything to go well: A great weather forecast with not too fresh temperatures during the night, clear skies to see the stars (and some faint Northern Lights!), a really nice trail, a lot less bugs than a few weeks ago still, and tasty berries along a nice trail. My wife dropped us off at Svedjehamn and then the three of us set out on the trail.</p>

<p>Along the trail we tasted lingonberries and Seabuckthorn berries, which grow a lot here in the Archipelago. They are a bit sour, but super healthy, and I find them really tasty. The kids got in the middle some Marshmallows as a motivation to keep going, but thanks to our regular Sunday hikes they are happy and able to walk longer distances - and so this 3,5 km trip was done after just an hour of hiking. As we arrived at L√•nggrundet we went to look together for the best spot for our <a href="https://tidd.ly/34LniCV">‚àû new family tent</a>, and together picked a really good spot. I told the kids what‚Äôs most important, and they did a great job with pitching the tent and checking if it‚Äôs a flat spot =)</p>

<p>The next thing was what the kids waited for the most: Dinner! While I myself have a vegan diet since two years now, the kids like to eat some meat now &amp; then, and they wished to take some Bratwurst with us so we could grill them over the fire! They loved the grilled sausages which they ate around the fire hungrily, while I prepared two <a href="https://tidd.ly/2X2n0CX">‚àû LYO Food meals</a> for us. We took them and our three long-handled Titanium spoons to the jetty, where we sat down in the setting sun and enjoyed our second dinner above the water. And because I wanted to make sure that they‚Äôre warm at night, we topped things off with a hot chocolate with more Marshmallows after that! Their bellies full they definitely were happy, and after brushing their teeth (they were not a fan of my <a href="https://amzn.to/3fd2AgD">‚àû DentTabs</a>üòÅ) the two of them retired to the tent and were reading with their headlamps on.</p>

<p>Once they put their lights off I went to take some photos.</p>

<p>I stayed up till a wee bit past midnight, as there was a good chance to see the Northern Lights that night, but ultimately was pretty tired and so also went to brush my teeth, topped off my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/therm-a-rest-neoair-uberlight-sleeping-mat/?pid=10239">‚àû Uberlite</a> with one more puff and then snuggled up in my <a href="https://katabaticgear.com/shop/chisos-sleeping-bag/">Katabatic Gear Chisos</a> quilt. The kids were already peacefully sleeping under their own quilts (one <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/as-tucas-sestrals-quilt.html">As Tucas Sestrals Quilt</a> and one <a href="https://www.vaude.com/en-INT/Equipment/Sleeping-Bags-Mats/Sleeping-Bags/4792/Alpstein-450-DWN">Vaude Alpstein 450 quilt</a>), and soon I too was sleeping - though there were a lot of Whopper Swans making noise around us, and also some sheep with bells were walking around.</p>

<p>The next morning the oldest one was up at 8 am, and together we got silently out of the tent while the little one continued to sleep in the middle. I started to prepare breakfast for us - instant chocolate porridge with strawberries and raspberries - and then picked the little one up when she woke up. Together we sat at one of the benches, eating all our porridge, enjoying the warm, sunny weather on this Sunday morning.</p>

<p>And then it was time to start to pack already and head back to Svedjehamn. I asked the kids if they‚Äôd like to pick some Seabuckthorn berries for us, which we could make into a cake at home, and much to my surprise they were up for it (they did get several Marshmallows as a reward, too üòÉ)! This was perfect, because while they were picking berries I was able to pack everything into our three backpacks - of which I had the biggest one, a <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=47cd1998-e608-4548-aa0f-3d33e964ad3a&amp;website_id=a037a589-aec6-4e81-920c-77b10ab91eff&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fhyperlitemountaingear.com%2Fcollections%2Fpacks%2Fproducts%2F3400-southwest">‚àû Hyperlite Mountain gear SouthWest 3400</a>!</p>

<p>Soon after, we shouldered our much lighter packs, and started the enjoyable hike back.</p>

<p>An hour later our little adventure came to an end. Again we picked tasty lingonberries and Seabuckthorn berries along the way, passed the birdwatching tower and the picturesque red boat sheds, and gave mom a big hug when we met her at Svedjehamn!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50290022317/in/dateposted/" title="Autumn colours"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50290022317_9045479cd0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Autumn colours" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>It was a great little trip with my kids. They also enjoyed it a lot, and are already asking when we will go the next time! With autumn at our doorstep the best time to go hiking and backpacking just started, so I hope we get to explore some trails around Vaasa and camp out together soon again!</p>
