<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34911209154/in/dateposted/" title="#MountainLies"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4099/34911209154_f01315429d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="#MountainLies" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>When you’re out hiking and backpacking with friends there come these times on the hill where you or someone else is starting to not have fun anymore. It’s too hot, the summit seems far away, you’re sweating or are soaking wet from the rain. That’s the moment someone usually utters one or several #MountainLies - a lie to keep you motivated. If you’re an active Hiker and outdoors person you probably have heard some of these said. Here’s the five most common lies uttered on the mountain.</p>

<h2 id="behind-that-hill-is-the-summit">Behind that hill is the summit</h2>

<p>This is the mountain lie I have told several times myself. But then things conspired against me and, well, the summit wasn’t behind that hill - and also not after the next one, and next one, and next one. When Motivation is low and the summit the goal, this is the lie you will most likely hear. It keeps people going, but <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-the-bregenzerwald.html">the summit</a> - it never is behind that hill, but more likely another good hour of steep hiking further away.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29024562754/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Almost at the summit"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8256/29024562754_862a199ca5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Almost at the summit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="this-is-the-steepest-part">This is the steepest part</h2>

<p>The trail is steep. Steep as in, you’re using hand and feet to actually be able to move upward. For your friends with the DNA of an ibex this is no problem at all, but those who lack these genes are sweaty, angry and want to turn around. Because <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/autumn-backpacking-in-the-dolomites.html">climbing up this near vertical trail</a> just is no fun. <em>This is the steepest part, it gets easier after this section</em> is what you’ll likely hear then. But it doesn’t get flatter - at least not for long. With some luck you’re going to encounter a bit further up the “trail” a section which is even steeper. Lucky for you that it’s not raining, right?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20660450391/in/album-72157656091400816/" title="Lago di Sorapiss and a wonderful scree field"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5692/20660450391_04f879eb54_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Lago di Sorapiss and a wonderful scree field" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="its-not-going-to-rain-today">It’s not going to rain today</h2>

<p>This Mountain Lie you usually hear in the morning while you’re sitting at the breakfast table or at the trailhead. The clouds look more black and menacing than anything you’ve seen before in your life - and wasn’t that thunder you heard there in the distance? <em>No, it’s not gonna rain today</em> - usually followed by the sentence <em>That’s what the weather forecast promised</em>. If you’re still sitting at home and have a good book along - heat up the stove, grab a second cup of coffee and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/09/andrew-skurka-the-ultimate-hikers-gear-guide.html">read that book</a> while your weather-forecast-trusting friends will be soaked to the bone.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29831355665/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Cloudy?"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8148/29831355665_d56e989435_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cloudy?" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="the-sun-comes-out-in-a-moment">The sun comes out in a moment</h2>

<p>When you did believe your weather-forecast-trusting friends and went hiking with them in the rain, after you’re soaking wet and you are angry that you believed the membrane’s claim to “<a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/marmot-speed-light-jacket.html">Guaranteed to keep you dry</a>” your friend with the undying trust in the weather forecast will proclaim that <em>the sun comes out in a moment</em>. This usually means you will continue to be hiking in the rain and clouds until you’re back at home, when indeed the sun might come out before it dips behind the mountains. After all, a moment is a very brief amount of time which can stretch to many hours.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27688672272/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Sunrise on the Kanisfluh!"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7568/27688672272_588f6a62e3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunrise on the Kanisfluh!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="only-20-minutes-till-the-mountain-hut">Only 20 minutes till the Mountain Hut</h2>

<p>You’re hungry and have no power left. All you want is a hot cup of coffee and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/11/packrafting-and-mountainbiking-in-the-kaiserwinkl.html">a delicious plate of Kaiserschmarrn</a>. You’ll voice this situation to your friends, and prompt comes the reply from the mate up ahead on the trail: <em>“Only 20 minutes till the Mountain Hut”</em>. You continue hiking, savouring already that delicious food in front of you, and in just twenty short minutes you’re able to sit down and enjoy it. After fifteen minutes of hiking you get light doubts - there’s no hut to be seen anywhere. Another five minutes later it dawns on you that it was not in a life-time 20 minutes to the next hut, but more likely another hour.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16722309005/in/album-72157645045051650/" title="Schronisko Ornak"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8621/16722309005_bbefa8249f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Schronisko Ornak" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We take a look at new backpacks coming in 2018 from Osprey, Gregory, Ortovox, Mammut, Arc’teryx, Eagle Creek and CiloGear.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34734977903/in/dateposted/" title="Osprey Levity 45"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4290/34734977903_528036f73d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Osprey Levity 45" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Like <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-2016/">last year</a> I’ll sort the new gear posts by category - <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/OutDoor-2016-Backpacks.html">backpacks</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/08/outdoor-2016-news-tents.html">tents</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/07/outdoor-2016-news-stoves.html">other gear</a>. Who knows, maybe I even do an apparel post this year =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35675084516/in/dateposted/" title="Osprey Levity Lid"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4290/35675084516_0a69739c0b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Osprey Levity Lid" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>First up is the <strong>Osprey Levity</strong> backpack. It’s an OutDoor Award Winner, will come in spring 2018 into the shops and then is available in two sizes: 45 l (810 g) and 60l (850 g). What is special about the Levity is that while it looks like a normal Ultralight backpack it actually has a ventilated mesh back. My hand easily fit between the backpanel of the pack and the mesh frame, this should make it an excellent choice for hiking in very warm climates. The large side pockets can be accessed from the top and side, there’s a very big front pocket for gear you need throughout the day and a zippered lid which stores keys, phone, wallet and such.</p>

<p>The beauty of this pack is not just that it means lightweight packs go <em>really</em> mainstream but that this will open up lightweight backpacking up to a much wider audience. Osprey packs can be found in many brick &amp; mortar outdoor shops around the globe, and that means consumers will see this pack live in the store, can try it out, and convince themselves of the benefit of a lightweight pack that carries well. It’s, so to speak, the perfect backpack to convert many more people to the ultralight path of backpacking because it’s nice that you can e &amp; try the pack before you buy it.</p>

<p>Another backpack which was light and innovative is  the <strong>ORTOVOX Peak Light 32 Backpack</strong>. I’m a big fan of ORTOVOX and really like their garments, but also their paired down alpine packs are really interesting. This is a pack for the alpine climbing community and comes with a Swiss Wool backpanel. The pack is 1.050 g light but can be stripped to 690 g if you take off the lid, hip belt and wire frame for the back. But the Swisswool-tec-Knit Back System is the really interesting part here, as in it Ortovox combines <em>foam and pressed Swiss wool covered with a high-tech knitted fabric with a different hole structure.</em> This processing should enable excellent temperature management and should still be comfortable if you’ve sweated on the wool back panel. As it is wool it has the same properties as your wool shirts. Does it work? Well, for that you should check out reviews once these packs are out for a while =)</p>

<p>To get into the Mammut booth you had to be a Blogger (Yay!) or have an appointment. I lacked the latter thus made use of my Blogger Pass to enter the booth, and here the <strong>Mammut Trion Nordwand 20</strong> pack caught my attention. That ain’t difficult as it is orange and I am drawn to everything orange (I blame my Dutch Heritage). The 20 l pack weighs 580 g, is made of a Dyneema Ripstop material, has a clean look and even is pretty water-resistant with a 5,000 mm water column. Like the garments in the Eiger Extreme Series the pack has been been developed using Mammut High Reach Technology in the carrying system, which Mammut claims makes reaching upwards easier &amp; hence provides additional freedom of movement for climbing. If your goals are fast &amp; light ascents of high mountains then this is a pack to keep in mind for summer 2018.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35675185496/in/photostream/" title="Mammut Trion Nordwand 20 Front Pocket"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4039/35675185496_f5e6654ace_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Mammut Trion Nordwand 20 Front Pocket" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34905265063/in/dateposted/" title="Mammut Trion Nordwand 20"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4263/34905265063_ec09338850_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Mammut Trion Nordwand 20" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The next pack brings us back to the trails and is made for backpacking. Long-time readers might recall that my first backpack was a Gregory pack, for which I paid 500 DM back when we had not yet the Euro (It’d would be 250€ in today’s money!). For a teenager that was a lot of money, and I used this pack for over ten years until I lost it in an accident (possibly I repeat this story every year anew?). Anyway, fast forward to 2018 and we’ll get the <strong>Gregory Optic</strong>, (and Octal for Women, which is a much cooler name!), Gregory’s next foray into the lightweight pack niche.</p>

<p>It isn’t as light as the Levity above at 1.120 g for the 48 l version and 1.140 g for the 58 l pack, but it comes with the Gregory-specific comfortable fit, robust materials and full functionality. It has an AeroSpan suspension system which is a further development of the Gregory VaporSpan system, and also should make the pack comfortable to wear in warmer climates. Add in the well-carrying hipbelt from gregory and you have a pack that should carry loads up to 14 kg nicely. It also has a large stretch front pocket, stretch side pockets, an integrated raincover and several bells &amp; whistles to attach things to the pack. At 190€/ 210€ it’s a bit cheaper than the Levity but almost 300 g heavier. However, this is again a step into the right direction I believe, as it makes lightweight backpacks easily available to a large audience, and hence I welcome this addition to the market.</p>

<p>CiloGear was also again at the show and handing out backpacks to this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CiloGear/photos/a.410469092734.196568.42853277734/10154411493187735/?type=3&amp;theater">Thomas Huber</a> guy. I also got a backpack - and then the owner whispered something into my ear, I gave back the pack (the second CiloGear backpack I returned voluntarily - yeps, I might be slightly insane =) and now am waiting for a parcel of joy from Oregon.</p>

<p>I also saw the two new Arc’teryx trailrunning backpacks - and while I have some photos of them they’re not that good, hence the stock photo underneath. The <strong>Arcteryx Norvan Hydration Vest</strong> comes in a 7 l and a 14 l Version and the 14 l version is lighter than the smaller 7 l pack. The Norvan 14 is 256 g or 417 g with the included bladder, while the Norvan 7 weighs 263 g or 424 g with the water bladder. Both packs have that <em>comfortable ‘bounce-free’ fit that wears more like clothing, yet with the functionality of a backpack</em>. The 14 l pack is carrying your snacks, water and kit for long runs, while the smaller Norvan 7 is for shorter runs where you don’t need so much gear. Both are impeccably designed as you know from <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/arcteryx-workshop-tour.html">Arc’teryx</a> and will retail for 170€ and 190€ respectively.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the last backpack in this article, the <strong>Eagle Creek Global Companion Travel Pack</strong>. This is a pack for my travel (blogger) friends who only take a carry-on on their journeys. Available as a 40l and a 65l pack these fold open like a book  and have zippered compartments which keep your garments and kit in place which is great for packing and unpacking - I’m not a big fan of packing a pack from the top. At 1.620 g for the 40 l pack and 2.330 g for the 65 l pack they’re not super light, but if you only need it to get your gear from the Airport to your <a href="www.airbnb.com/c/hmorkel">AirBnB</a> or Ho(s)tel it’s alright. They have side pockets, self-repairing and lockable zippers, a rainfly and have the No Matter What™ Warranty - though as they’re build from durable materials you probably don’t need to make use of it.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35157179300/in/dateposted/" title="Chilling in the Helsport Lofoten"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4231/35157179300_88baec6593_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Chilling in the Helsport Lofoten" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After a week at Lake Constance and an almost 38 h long trip home (Thanks Frankfurt Airport!) it’s time to pen down some thoughts from the 2017 OutDoor Show in Friedrichhafen. This was, as I just realized, my fifth OutDoor Show - I haven’t missed it since I <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2013/">first went in 2013</a>. As I blog professionally since several years the show is a mandatory visit to meet partners new &amp; old (I’m a Helsport Ambassador, sponsored by La Sportiva and talking with a handful of companies for specific projects). While at the beginning of my OutDoor visits the new gear was of course quite exciting (and still is) it is more and more about the people I meet at the fair which makes the fair so valuable &amp; exciting for me.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34734985353/in/dateposted/" title="Glen Van Peski and Chris Townsend on the #OutDoorFN"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4256/34734985353_4d91b1387c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Glen Van Peski and Chris Townsend on the #OutDoorFN" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Take for example Glen Van Peski, the founder of Gossamer Gear, and Chris Townsend, the renown Backpacking Writer. I met Glen and his wife by pure co-incidence (funnily enough at the Osprey booth while we were all checking out the Levity backpack) and we later in the afternoon managed to meet-up again for a beer and chat more. I also ran a couple of times into Chris and we had a nice evening chatting with fellow bloggers. Add in that I also met again my long-time friend Jotaro from Locus Gear, many, many blogger, photographer and journalism colleagues and you will quickly realize that the show is for me about the people I meet here. The same goes for my contacts as the various companies I visit - many are much more than just “work contacts” but friends with whom we talk about family &amp; life (which means sometimes only around 10 minutes remain to check out the new gear!).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34734958003/in/dateposted/" title="Alastair Humphreys on the OutDoor Stage"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4213/34734958003_7e3324c12d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Alastair Humphreys on the OutDoor Stage" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Speaking of gear, it felt industry-wise lightweight is getting more &amp; more to the front - a good things for us ultralight everything enthusiasts. Lighter garments, lighter shoes, lighter backpacks, lighter tents &amp; shelters, lighter stoves &amp; food, lighter climbing gear, lighter packrafting equipment, lighter bikepacking kit - across the board you’re able to find much more lighter gear for your outdoor activities. Functionality didn’t suffer, though - this lighter kit should be able to perform just as well as heavier counterparts.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35376626162/in/dateposted/" title="Best Booth of the Fair: The Houdini Garden"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4229/35376626162_33cd381407_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Best Booth of the Fair: The Houdini Garden" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My favourite booth this year was the Houdini Garden above - it was just wonderful and happily the temperatures this year (up to 32°C!) meant it was nice to sit outside in the shade. Add in that the smoothies &amp; cocktails they served from the herbs which they have grown in the composted Houdini garments soil were super tasty.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35157176010/in/dateposted/" title="Awesome new Vaude Performance Mats"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4259/35157176010_53842e349e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Awesome new Vaude Performance Mats" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I’ll try to delve into depth in more articles about the gear I saw at the show, but in this post I want to highlight some kit which I remember from the top of my head. First is probably the new series of Vaude sleeping mats. These are so well engineered that I believe they will be super-successful when they hit the market as so many details on them are just <strong>Wow!</strong></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34734943163/in/dateposted/" title="New Arc&#x27;teryx Konseal FL Approach Shoe"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4264/34734943163_74b2d06ff4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="New Arc&#x27;teryx Konseal FL Approach Shoe" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>These new Arc’teryx Konseal FL Approach shoes are beautifully designed and so light, I hope to get a pair for my feet before 2018!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35376671012/in/dateposted/" title="New Paramo Manu Shirt"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4262/35376671012_3256998877_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="New Paramo Manu Shirt" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Paramo’s new design is superb - gone the more conservative and boxy cuts &amp; colours, welcome to youthful &amp; fresh designs which promise to also perform well outdoors.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34735997253/in/dateposted/" title="Rab Mythic 400"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4290/34735997253_9fb8ced02e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Rab Mythic 400" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Rab launched a 7D sleeping bag line, and the Mythic 400 sleeping bag here will tip the scales at 660 g and has a comfort rating of -1°C. Feels great on the skin and could shed quite some weight in the sleeping bag department.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35157981650/in/dateposted/" title="Kupilka 37"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4266/35157981650_6e8908f43e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Kupilka 37" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The new Kupilka 37 Kuksa has 370 ml of volume and is thus quite a bit bigger than the regular good old Kupilka 21 - an increase in size which is very welcome as this could make it the one cup for all your trips! I got one and will put it through its paces the next months to see if it is a worthy addition to the gear closet.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34734977903/in/dateposted/" title="Osprey Levity 45"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4290/34734977903_528036f73d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Osprey Levity 45" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Osprey Levity backpack looks like a well designed lightweight backpack with a ventilated back.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34734969483/in/dateposted/" title="Houdini Garments can be composted!"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4233/34734969483_0371c4a6c0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Houdini Garments can be composted!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Another trend is that sustainability, recycling and closing the loop is no longer just on the mind of a few outliers - across the board you could see an uptake of this topic on the show. From shoes which are Made in Europe to garments which can be recycled, composted and repaired, many companies I visited talked about sustainability and doing good for the outdoors. As I have a background in this area I’m delighted to see that more and more outdoor brands start to act to keep our outdoor playgrounds in a good condition.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34702820614/in/dateposted/" title="Smoothies at the Houdini Booth"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4238/34702820614_4be54a8bbc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Smoothies at the Houdini Booth" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So much for now - as I said, I’ll try to dive into detail into some areas of gear and news later on. In the meanwhile have a look at the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/albums/72157685424312086">OutDoor 2017</a> Photo Album and check out my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/hikinginfinland/videos/?ref=page_internal">Facebook Live Videos</a> which I shot &amp; shared during the show. <em>If you enjoy this #OutDoorFN 2017 Re-Cap &amp; other articles why not <a href="https://paypal.me/hendrikmorkel">support me with a coffee or two</a>?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A suitcase per person, packing, unpacking, did it all arrive at the baggage claim - family travel can be an Odyssey. We always try to travel light, but after several years of trying and testing we finally have arrived at an truly ultralight setup which allows us to use only one duffel for the four of us. Read on to find out how we achieved travel bliss!</p>

<p>We have travelled with a combination of luggage - a large suitcase, my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/10/one-duffle-to-rule-them-all-the-arcteryx-carrier-duffle.html">Arc’teryx Carrier Duffles</a> or just a backpack when going for a weekend somewhere. And while all of these where fine and did get the job done - transporting clothing and stuff from A to B - it never was a perfect experience. Sometimes the suitcase got broken or something arrived late, or the most common problem that the packing for going home was more difficult because things didn’t fit in as nicely in anymore as on the way there and there was more. The solution for me seemed simple: One piece of luggage for the four of us and a set of <a href="http://shop.eaglecreek.com/pack-it-specter/l/231">Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Cubes</a> for each family member, colour-coordinated so everyone can find their clothes quickly.</p>

<p>I myself have used Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Cubes for a couple of years now and really liked them - they allowed me to pack fast &amp; easy with all garments of one kind in one cube. So getting a set for each family member seemed like a logical solution - this way everyone can pack their shirts, pants, socks and underwear together and easily finds their garments. The more difficult thing was to decide on a luggage suitcase or duffel. Because I already own three great duffels of varying size and like that especially at home they pack down to a small package, it was easy for us to keep on looking for a duffel. But what we knew we wanted was that it should have wheels so it is easier to transport - carrying a full 120l duffel is alright, but it is way more comfortable to pull it after yourself.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35071907976/in/dateposted/" title="Arrived in Frankfurt Airport"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4274/35071907976_2726dec0a8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arrived in Frankfurt Airport" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the end I picked the <a href="http://shop.eaglecreek.com/cargo-hauler-rolling-duffel-120l-xl/d/1549C3078?CategoryId=334">Cargo Hauler Rolling Duffel XL</a> - because it had wheels, is made from durable and water-resistant material AND is covered under the Eagle Creek <a href="http://www.eaglecreek.com/warranty">No Matter What Warranty</a> which <em>covers the Lifetime Warranty promise plus the added insurance of repair or replacement due to product failure during the product lifetime, regardless of the cause.</em> That means this should be for the next fifty plus years of travelling the only duffel I will ever need - and should it ever get damaged it’s easy to send it in for repairs. If you ever needed to go buy a new suitcase because your airline damaged yours you’ll appreciate this a lot!</p>

<p>At 1.587 g the Cargo Hauler Rolling Duffel XL (without the carrying straps and the storage bag - these add 254 g) is light and doesn’t eat too much into your maximum luggage allowance (on most of my flights in Europe that’s 23 kg). Part of that weight is accounted for by the durable wheels which had no problem coping with the cobblestone streets of my home town Gelnhausen in Germany where we were the last two weeks. The 120 l volume were spacious enough for us four - two adults, a toddler and a child. We even had empty space in it flying out of Finland! But what we maybe like best is how small and compact it packs away at home - because lets face it, such a duffel will be used in the best case only around six to eight weeks a year, which means it is in storage around 44 weeks a year. We had large suitcases which took too much space, but the Cargo Hauler packs down to the size of a large 2 l bottle - that is tiny, really! It packs away easily in the included bag and so is out of the way when we are at home =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34981000361/in/dateposted/" title="Plenty of space &amp; easy packing!"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4240/34981000361_db50bf9a11_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Plenty of space &amp; easy packing!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A big reason why we four were able to travel with just one 120l Duffel was that all four of us had a set of Pack-It Specter Cubes. My favourite of the bunch is by far the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/eagle-creek-pack-it-specter-compression-cube-packsack/?pid=10239">Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Compression Cube</a>. I usually pack four to five T-Shirts, an extra pants, shorts and a running shorts and shirt in these, and the zipper which runs around the cube compresses these garments to half the size. This is especially useful if I fly only with a carry-on as then space is at a premium and the Compression Cube lets me save quite a bit of space! It <a href="http://bit.ly/2qQHXOX">is also available as a Set</a> with a large Compression Cube and a Half Compression Cube, which are a good investment!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://bit.ly/2rDD6Sm">Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Garment Folder</a> is a god-send for someone like me who can not fold his button-down shirts in a good manner. The included plate lets me fold up my shirts in a clean and elegant manner so I don’t need to iron them where I arrive, which is another thing I’m not particularly good at or fond of. So anything that makes my life easier is a welcome addition! I had five shirts in the Garment Folder and there was still room for a couple more, so especially if you travel for business this one is the Pack-It Specter to get.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://bit.ly/2qQwHCm">Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Cube</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/2qUb349">Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Half Cube</a> are similar to the Compression Cube - sans compression. I pack in the Half Cube all my socks and underwear - or on some weekend trips I even have managed to only need this one to pack a shirt, boxer shorts, socks and pants. In the normal-sized Cube I pack garments which need a bit more space - an insulation jacket and hardshell for example.</p>

<p>Finally, the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/eagle-creek-pack-it-specter-shoe-sac-packsack/?pid=10239">Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Shoe Sac</a> is just one of three Cubes Eagle Creek bags to transport your shoes. The Shoe Sac is fine for a pair of sandals and an extra pair of shoes, or four pairs of kids and toddle shoes. These allow you too keep your duffel and other things in your bag clean and not get in touch with the dirt from the street or trails you’ve been running on.</p>

<p>If you like the sound of these Cubes then a good start is of course on of the <a href="http://bit.ly/2qQKpF6">Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Cube Sets</a> which gets a set of three cubes - that’s plenty for most ultralight travellers - or <a href="http://bit.ly/2sapyAv">take the set with the Garment Folder</a> if you travel a lot for business so your shirts stay in a good shape!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34301585383/in/dateposted/" title="Six Pack-It System Cubes"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4278/34301585383_098b941fd9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Six Pack-It System Cubes" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="the-bottomline">The Bottomline</h2>

<p>With the help of Eagle Creek’s genius Pack-It Specter System and their Cargo Hauler Rolling Duffel XL our little family of four can now travel with just one piece of checked luggage - an ultralight dream come true. It’s easy to pack gear at home and when leaving from the destination, and thanks to the colour-coded Pack-It Specter Cubes every family member can easily find their garments. The Compression Cubes minimize gear, the Shoe Sac keeps dirty shoes away from other garments &amp; gear and the Cube &amp; Half Cube pack garments in an organized manner. At the destination it’s easy to find shorts and socks by looking in the Cube you packed them, and packing for going home is just as simple as it was when you left! Finally, back at home the Cubes and the Duffel can be stored in a compact manner so don’t take up a lot of space!</p>

<p>Like most parents we think our two kids are active and enough outside, but a real way of measuring this assumption we did not have - until around three weeks ago. Then the ReimaGo Sensor and some compatible garments arrived at the Hiking in Finland HQ - and then there was just one thing to do: Install the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/fi/app/reimago/id1083484265?mt=8">ReimaGo App</a>, plug the <a href="https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1173541864&amp;as=1179503632&amp;t=2&amp;tk=1&amp;url=https://www.reima.com/fi/ReimaGO/ReimaGO%C2%AE-sensori/p/599160-9990">ReimaGo Sensor</a> in the <a href="https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1173541864&amp;as=1179503632&amp;t=2&amp;tk=1&amp;url=https://www.reima.com/fi/Koululaisten-lastenvaatteet/Ulkovaatteet/Ulkotakit/ReimaGO%C2%AE-softshell-takki-Hatch/p/531263-8800">ReimaGo softshell jacket</a> and… live life normally. We don’t own a car and go everywhere by bike or on foot, and so do our kids - so for us we wanted to see if during our normal, regular days our kids get enough outdoor exercise time or if we need to add more outdoor time to our schedule.</p>

<h2 id="the-reimago-sensor">The ReimaGo Sensor</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1173541864&amp;as=1179503632&amp;t=2&amp;tk=1&amp;url=https://www.reima.com/fi/ReimaGO/ReimaGO%C2%AE-sensori/p/599160-9990">ReimaGo Sensor</a> has been developed together with Suunto, another Finnish company which you might know from their high-quality wrist watches. The sensor makes use of Suunto’s Movesense technology. It’s a durable little button design that is waterproof to 30 m and attaches to compatible garments - either drop it into a small pocket or attach it to the designated place (see the underneath photo). The ideas is to use the sensor only outdoors - at least thus far the garments that the sensor connects with are all outdoor garments. This isn’t good news for kids who train e.g. indoor sports, but then nothing really stops you to put the ReimaGo Sensor just into a pocket when your child trains indoors. Maybe this is the next line of ReimaGo garments the company will launch - and with the OutDoor just a short four weeks away we probably know more soon!</p>

<h2 id="the-reimago-app">The ReimaGo App</h2>

<p>The ReimaGo App turns the tracked data into a <em>“game”</em> that sets challenges and rewards children for their efforts. The game is less PokemonGo and more just that the child is collecting through its outdoor activities <em>energy</em> which lets it move its avatar through the various levels. All there is to the game is the pushing of a button to use the collected energy to move forward, and if you finish a level there’s a short animation and you get a digital Award for the finished level. After not even three weeks our son is already in Level 7 and there’s only 15 Levels, so I reckon that some time in June we will be done - unless there’s an update which adds more levels.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34346885600/in/dateposted/" title="ReimaGo Level 4"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4170/34346885600_2110a4d699_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="ReimaGo Level 4" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34600218181/in/photostream/" title="Animation after finishing Level 4"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4179/34600218181_84fe1c7a8d_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="Animation after finishing Level 4" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34600217981/in/photostream/" title="Award after finishing Level 4"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4177/34600217981_f76b559065_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="Award after finishing Level 4" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Besides the <em>Kids side</em> of the ReimaGo App there’s also a parents side. Here you can add rewards for time spent outdoors - like an ice cream after five hours outdoors, or you can take a photo of a reward you create yourself (<a href="http://amzn.to/2qvLo06">LEGO Ninjago</a> is very popular here right now and thus makes for a great incentive to play outdoors!). This we find a good way to keep the child interested in the app - though truth be told, our son still loves to check each evening his energy of the day and his eyes go big when he sees how much time he has spent outdoors!</p>

<p>At the beginning you set a daily target of outdoor time, and we started out with the recommended 1 hour per day (= 7 hours a week). In his first week our son was triple that outdoors, so now we have raised the time to 90 minutes daily. The length of the Levels corresponds to the daily amount set; to keep these times realistic makes for a better experience for the kids, so don’t go offer the top! We also added our first reward - going to eat an ice cream - so are looking forward to see his surprise when he gets this reward!</p>

<h2 id="the-experience">The Experience</h2>

<p>We really like the whole ReimaGo experience. The ReimaGo garments - we got a pants and a jacket - are as high-quality as we are used to from Reima, and our son also likes to wear them. Easy to use, easy to clean, good fit and great freedom of movement - in short, a great jacket and pants.</p>

<p>The Sensor and App are easy to set up and use - from adding the child’s account to the app over playing the game to adding rewards - and are well made with a pleasing design for kids and adults alike. The levels are different enough to keep it exciting, and the best thing obviously is that it really makes our son want to go play outdoors so that he can collect energy. Every evening after dinner we get the sensor, open tha ReimaGo app and then see how active he was today. He then uses his collected energy to move through the level and is might proud when he has finished it - looking forward to the next day!</p>

<p>Finally, what we also like is that with the App you can add multiple kids - each with their own sensor - to it and so can keep an eye on the whole tribe’s activity. And if you yourself don’t have a fitness tracker yet, obviously nothing could stop you to get a ReimaGo Sensor for yourself to see how active you are =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34346886040/in/dateposted/" title="Active day!"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4183/34346886040_e9615a2fd6_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="Active day!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34346886190/in/photostream/" title="And an active week!"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4192/34346886190_a4386f8a1b_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="And an active week!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34600217781/in/photostream/" title="Finished another ReimaGo Level!"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4177/34600217781_1bc808afc2_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="Finished another ReimaGo Level!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="the-bottomline">The Bottomline</h2>

<p>We were sceptical if we needed an activity monitor for our son - we felt he’s plenty outside, plus attaching a sensor to our child already felt a wee bit like trying to control him. But as the Sensor really only tracks his movement and time spent outside this concern was unfounded. The ReimaGo sensor is also more child-friendly than many other fitness trackers for kids on the market as it is easy to use, affordable and durable. That the sensor is hidden in the jacket or pants also makes it less intrusive than a wristband, and the gamification of the outdoor activity makes the whole go-out-and-play idea very appealing for the small kids, in comparison to a chart of numbers which normal fitness trackers give you. It has allowed us to see how active our child is (on average 2+ hours a day, so well above what the World Health Organization recommends) and encourage him to play outdoors - even if the weather isn’t sunshine and blue sky.</p>

<p>Overall we can recommend the ReimaGo sensor if you’d like to encourage your child to go play outside or would like to find out how much time she spends outdoors. The Rewards which you can add for your child in the App - from an ice cream, a camping trip or another present - help motivate kids to go play outside and keep them interested in the App. Ultimately I feel this helps us to motivate our kids for longer hikes, bike rides and backpacking trips, and spend more quality-family-outdoor-time together =)</p>

<p>My intentions were simple for 2016: <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/01/zero-gear-year.html">No New Outdoor Gear</a>. I have enough of everything, from stoves over backpacks, quilts, shelters to shoes and apparel. And so I informed my partners that this gear nerd here is trying not to test &amp; use the <em>latest and greatest</em> but stick to my tried and used equipment. The months slipped by, I visited the ISPO without taking any of the free kit offered home, went on a lot of fantastic skiing trips, until <strong>BANG</strong> the post man stumbled into my house on a sunny April afternoon. While we knew each other well and he had no problems finding me in the prior years, he now asked me questioningly <em>“Hendrik Morkel?”</em>. I was just as surprised as him, as I hadn’t ordered anything. I took the parcel inside, worried about my #NoGearYear and opened it. It was a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/therm-a-rest-evolite-plus-isomatte/?pid=10239">Therm-A-Rest Evolite Plus</a> which I had inquired about in the autumn of 2015.</p>

<p>I was bummed. Does this mean I ruined my #NoGearYear? I put the pad into a corner so I didn’t needed to see it anymore and carried on like it nothing happened. Went skiing, cycling and backpacking - without that pad. But even trying to not use it it meant I had a new piece of kit in the house, a fact I couldn’t make go away even if I ignored the offender. May and June passed without visits from the post man, and then I was off to the OutDoor in Friedrichshafen. There I met Graham from <a href="http://www.cilogear.com">CiloGear</a> who told me he had a present for me. He must have seen the shock on my face as he quickly added <em>“No worries, I know about your #NoGearYear, this is just something I want to loan you!”</em>. Ah, that was better. Graham went on to explain me the prototype backpack which has ascended with its former bearer the Eiger Northface twice and established up a new route on a high mountain in Pakistan. It was a work of art and Graham’s passion for his design became evident - it reminded me of the LAUFBURSCHE backpacks which are made with the same love &amp; attention to detail. After he ran me through the bells &amp; whistles of the back he told me that he wants it back in 2017 when we meet again at the OutDoor (which is next month!). Such an arrangement worked well for me - it didn’t mean I owned a new piece of gear, but only loaned it, and that was in line with the rules I set myself.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32396336051/in/dateposted/" title="Staring off into the distance"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/443/32396336051_9d5ed3cd01_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Staring off into the distance" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Well, the next shock came some time in the late summer as the zipper of my beloved <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody</a> went broken. It was still several months till the year would turn, and so I was looking into getting the zipper fixed. Alas, in the end I just wore the broken jacket as sending the jacket to the USA to get the zipper fixed seemed just like too much hassle. So I was wearing it as long as possible, and then now in 2017 I got a new one (finally a Size S!).</p>

<p>But that pad from April - it wasn’t my only lapse, I’m sorry to admit. In the autumn two companies I really like got in touch and asked if we could work together, long-term. I was pondering between a <em>“Lets get back in January”</em> and a <em>“Lets do this!”</em> and in the end I decided that this possibility was worth pursuing, even if I had a #NoGearYear going on. After all, I felt, my goal of not buying/ taking any gear was going well, and so I told them that I’d be delighted to work with them, and thus far it has been a really good partnership. I also received a brand-new quilt which I helped test &amp; design - with some luck you’ll read about this one later this week - and tested a new headlamp from another long-term partner, so all in all I probably had about a dozen of items arrive in 2016.</p>

<h2 id="the-aftermath">The Aftermath</h2>

<p>As you see, practically I failed my #NoGearYear. Theoretically, however, I feel I won. In 2016 I gave up the two gear editor jobs I was doing which means I now can use the gear I really want to use and do not need to test different kit all the time. Another positive side effect is also that less stuff arrives here (less than ten parcels have arrived here this year!) and I can continue with less hassle to apply the KonMari principle to the stuff I own (Read <a href="http://amzn.to/2pQcqwj">The Life‑Changing Magic of Tidying Up</a> and make your life better!). I also started to charge for gear reviews on the blog if a company or PR Agency inquires if I’d like to test something or just say “No thanks”. I also was and am more outdoors, on more trips (even if you don’t read about them here yet - my other company is keeping me very busy, sorry) and spend more time with my family. So all in all this #NoGearYear has been a very positive experience for me, and I can only encourage everyone to try it, too - even if you might fail it, it should be a good opportunity to get less stuff you don’t really need and save money for trips you really want to go on!</p>

<p>It was with great sadness that I heard last Sunday about the death of Ueli Steck, an Alpinist &amp; Mountaineer I greatly looked up to. I was fortunate enough to meet Ueli several times throughout the last four years, and it all started with this <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/08/ueli-steck-interview.html">video interview</a> with him. He was a warm, friendly person and I always enjoyed chatting with him, about Finland, Switzerland, alpinism and climbing. I sincerely wish his wife and family much love &amp; strength in this time of mourning.</p>

<p>Like any good movie also <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/the-week-in-review/">The Week In Review</a> makes a return to your screens. Many of you have reached out to me and asked me to start to write the TWIR again, and after much thinking I decided to dust the good old TWIR off again and take it out of retirement. I hope it will get better and that you still will like it as much as previously, and that together we can make this the best resource for finding out about excellent content from the outdoors - be it backpacking, paddling &amp; packrafting or bikepacking and climbing. <em>And no, this is not an April’s Fool Joke.</em></p>

And as it just dumped some 30 cm of snow and the winter holidays start here in Pohjanmaa it is time to shed some light on the Reimatec Stavanger Overall and why we love it!</p>

<p>Last December the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Lasten-ulkovaatteet/Lasten-haalarit-ja-setit/Lasten-Reimatec®%2B-toppahaalari-Stavanger/p/520190F-8430">Reimatec Stavanger Overall</a> arrived at the Hiking in Finland HQ and was immediately declared awesome by our son and very relieved parents (because they in a moment no longer needed to help dressing him up =). To understand this one needs to know that our son always needed a little assistance when he needed to put on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/11/winter-fun-with-the-reima-mamid-jacket-and-procyon-pants.html">Jacket and Pants</a> when it was time to go out. While he could put them on himself he prefrred to that mom or dad help him get dressed for the cold. As we have a one year old who can’t yet dress herself up this meant we were at once dressing up two kids, plus ourselves, before we could go out. This can get tedious to say the least, so when we saw that he was happy to put on the overall (in less than a minute, including <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Asusteet/Pipot-ja-hatut/c/k61">hat</a>, <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/brands/buff/for--kids/?pid=10239">Buff</a> and the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Asusteet/Hanskat-ja-rukkaset/Talvirukkaset-ja--hanskat/c/k63">Reimatec Suunta mitts</a>) we were very happy parents indeed!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32988261492/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3853/32988261492_093feeba9b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>So, now the kid has dressed himself up to go out into the cold, but how does the overall stand up to the use &amp; abuse a 5 year old can throw at it? Very well, we’d say. We were ice skating, building igloos, climbing on rocks, had running competitions and played hide &amp; seek, in temperatures from 0°C to -20°C. The waterproof &amp; breathable outer shell material has taken all these activities in stride and hasn’t failed us yet, keeping wind, snow and wetness at bay. It’s pretty durable, too - climbing on rocks with the knees and then sliding them back down hasn’t done any damage to the material.</p>

<p>It’s easy to clean, too - just throw it into the washing machine (add a suitable <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/toko-eco-softshell-wash-250-ml-detergent/?pid=10239">detergent</a>) at 40°C and an hour later you can hang it up to dry. Because of the insulation it needs around 12 to 16 hours to thoroughly dry, so keep that in mind.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32329153543/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2937/32329153543_c4ea0971cb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Warmth-wise the overall is toasty and is sufficient on its own up to temperatures of -5°C with our son. When it gets colder than -5°C we add a <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Koululaisten-lastenvaatteet/Lasten-lämpökerrastot/Yläosat/Lasten-fleecetakki-Frans/p/536097-3710">fleece jacket</a> and <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Lasten-sisävaatteet/Alaosat/Lasten-fleecehousut-Argelius/p/526243-6980">fleece pants</a> underneath the overall, and that’s no problem as there’s room to spare without restricting movement. Speaking of movement, snow angles, climbing on rocks and at the play ground, skiing and ice skating all were easy to do as the overall does not restrict the freedom of movement.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32761950190/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/601/32761950190_525fece769_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Also otherwise we really like the Stavanger Overall: The inside suspenders are great when dressing up and in breaks as our son can undress the overall but with the suspenders still over his shoulders he’s able to walk around without that the top is hanging on the floor. The width of the overall can be adjusted via two inside elastics, making it as wide or narrow as you need it. There’s only two pockets on it which is just the right amount, and the insulated hood with a fur collar can be removed (the fake fur, too). The leg cuffs can also be adjusted in width, while the elastic cuffs keep wind and snow from getting into the sleeves. The reflective details are easy to overlook, but there’s plenty of them, from top to bottom, which makes the wearer very visible on these dark winter nights and morning.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32761950830/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/746/32761950830_918aa8078a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Some words on the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Koululaisten-lastenvaatteet/Asusteet/Hanskat-ja-rukkaset/Lasten-Reimatec®%2B--topparukkaset-Suunta/p/527252-9990">Reimatec Suunta mitts</a>, too. We got these at the same time than the overall but they haven’t been used as much - simply because it was way too warm for them most of this <em>“winter”</em>. Now that the thermometer has shown beautiful double digit minus degrees it was time to put them on, and for playing in the snow and walking to the kindergarden or to town these were great to keep the little hands warm. These mitts have a very warm fleece lining and a snug cuff which goes high, and they’re best from temperatures over -10°C in our experience. Anything above that and our son would run very hot &amp; sweaty in them. Because they’re so long it’s best to put the gloves on before the overall, this is simpler. There’s some help needed to get the hands in the gloves through the elastic cuffs of the overall, but compared with dressing a kid up completely it’s a minor thing!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32761952150/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3929/32761952150_1a2e9a9ff8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that with the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Lasten-ulkovaatteet/Lasten-haalarit-ja-setit/Lasten-Reimatec®%2B-toppahaalari-Stavanger/p/520190F-8430">Reimatec Stavanger Overall</a> we have a happy son that can dress up alone at home &amp; in the kindergarden, allows him to play outside in the cold winter weather, be visible in the mornings and evenings when it gets dark, and it is easy to undress when going inside for a hot chocolate! A happy son of course means also happy parents, so the Stavanger gets from us six thumbs up! It’s a very durable and well-designed kids overall and we just hope our daughter will be fine with the green colour once she is big enough to wear it in some three years =)</p>

<p>Well, actually that should be a four I reckon - because I’m already a <a href="http://www.helsport.no/hendrik-morkel">Helsport Ambassador</a> since last year. But I met with three companies which I really value and like a lot, and we had great discussion on how to work together in 2017 and onwards.

<h2 id="greenpeace-x-gore-tex-x-sympatex">Greenpeace x Gore-Tex x Sympatex</h2>

<p><a href="http://sympatex.com">Sympatex</a> is already since last year working on a much more environmentally friendly membrane technology which is free of dangerous substances - and at the ISPO it launched its <em>“guaranteed green” Sympatex membrane, which is produced in a completely climate-neutral way for the first time. In order to eliminate any contribution to global warming, the ecological alternative among functional textile specialists will compensate the CO2 amount of its entire yearly membrane production starting from 2017 through respective climate protection certificates in cooperation with the Munich-based consultancy ClimatePartner. Thus, Sympatex can compensate even the last remaining CO2 emissions that are released during the production of the membrane with the support of internationally certified climate protection projects.</em> I already tweeted about this last year and am super-excited about this development, it’s a big step into the right direction. Add in that the Sympatex membrane is PFC free and is used by very environmentally conscious companies like Vaude and you know that this is a great shell membrane.</p>

<p>But Sympatex is sadly just a smaller player when it comes to membranes - it’s the giants which one needs to convince to become better. And while you may think of Greenpeace what you’d like, they managed to convince the giant to make amends and move into the right direction. Gore Fabrics will <em>eliminate PFCs of Environmental Concern from its general outdoor weatherproofing laminates (corresponding to 85% of products made with these laminates) by the end of 2020 and from its specialized weatherproofing laminates (corresponding to the remaining 15% of products made with these laminates) by the end of 2023. The company will develop new, more environmentally friendly technologies for weatherproof membranes and water repellent coatings for consumer products, researching both fluorine-free and fluorinated options, and publicly document that no hazardous PFCs are released into the environment throughout the product lifecycle.</em></p>

<p>So after two years of campaigning for <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/PFC-Revolution/">Detox Outdoor</a> we finally have convinced Gore-Tex that it is time to do something better - even if with Sympatex, Páramo &amp; Nikwax (see underneath) there are already PFC-free options available. But as most people have likely never heard of Sympatex and a hardshell is for them a Gore-Tex Jacket, it’s a great sign that <em>Gore Fabrics is excited about the opportunity to drive meaningful change in the outdoor industry by making a very significant investment in developing new technologies that are free of PFCs of Environmental Concern.</em> If you are curious about Gore’s Roadmap to go PFC free, <a href="http://www.gore-tex.com/en-us/experience/responsibility/environmental/fluorochemicals">have a look here</a>. Wondering what’s the raucous about PFC in the first place? Have a <a href="http://www.dw.com/de/bald-weniger-gift-in-outdoor-kleidung/a-37433778">look at this article</a> [in German] and if you want to know which brands offer PFC-free garments, <a href="https://www.greenpeace.de/presse/publikationen/factsheet-outdoor-branche-ohne-gefaehrliche-pfc">take a look at this pdf</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pramo-press-conference">Páramo Press Conference</h2>

<p>I try to avoid Press Conferences because, as Björn writes in his excellent <a href="https://st-bergweh.de/2017/02/10/ispo-2017-highlight-die-traenen-von-paramo/">Páramo Press Conference article</a>, they’re 97% useless for my work. Happily for us the Páramo Press conferences belongs the 1% which are fantastic, and hence I highly recommend that you direct your browser towards Björn’s great article and read the whole story about how Páramo’s partner, the Miquelina Foundation, became a member of the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) which means that Páramo garments are now Fair Trade verified - and not just that, it’s the first outdoor brand in the whole market which can use the <a href="http://wfto.com/standard-and-guarantee-system/our-product-label">WFTO First-Buyer Label</a>. Add in that Páramo garments are PFC-free, long-lasting and can easily be re-proofed with Nikwax products and you have a real winner =)</p>

<h2 id="scandal">Scandal!</h2>

<p>And then there was that small scandal right before the ISPO kicked off. A fellow blogger, Andreas from Gipfelfieber, <a href="http://gipfelfieber.com/2017/02/03/was-kostet-eigentlich-ein-ispo-award-und-laesst-der-sich-sogar-kaufen/">published an article</a> which asked <em>“Can an ISPO Award be bought?”</em>. Well, basically you need to pay either way an entry fee to compete in the Award, so the short answer is yes. The long answer, and which was written about in an <em>could-be-the-case-but-we-can’t-proof-it</em> style suggested that a Jury member offered an ISPO Award entry company the possibility to buy an award. Sadly the article can not deliver any real evidence that this is really the case and as long as this evidence is missing it is an accusation which I wouldn’t take too serious.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Sometime last autumn I purchased a new domain. My mind is set, I need a fresh start. After eight years of blogging at Hiking in Finland I need a new challenge. It’s a bad time to do this, but if I don’t do it not now I never might. Hiking in Finland is the most-read English-language blog from Scandinavia, there’s over 30.000 Regular Readers a month, add in the close to 20.000 Followers and Fans on the different Social Media channels and you can understand the dilemma of changing something that’s so successful and generates part of my income (Yes, I work full time on the blog since 2014).</p>

<p>Things that led to this is that I do far more nowadays than hiking in Finland - just last year I was ski-touring in Norway &amp; Switzerland, on adventure travel trips in Macedonia, Greece and Mexico, on active family holidays in Vorarlberg, backpacking in South Tyrol and cycle touring in Finland. So the name is out-dated and limits me, but I also moved away a bit from what this blog was about in the beginning - ultralight backpacking. While I maintain that Ultralight is Not Dead I also have started to look over the borders - I have entered a partnership with Helsport for example, and while I always try to carry as little as possible and use the lightest gear for the occasion it’s not the be all and end all of all things like it was more in the past.</p>

<p>But mostly I feel I have become complacent. The status quo is a dangerous place to get lazy and before other’s think <em>It’s the same old</em> I myself might just kill the status quo, reinvent and embark on a new journey. It might be rough on the edges at the beginning, some of you might not like it, but I am sure that with a new challenge I am able to grow myself and the blog to a new level that’s more creative &amp; honest.</p>

<h2 id="design-or-why-does-hif-look-not-like-it-used-to">DESIGN or why does HiF look not like it used to?</h2>
<p>Last November I managed to destroy the backend of Hiking in Finland - right before the #HiFAdventCalendar should have started and while I was in Mexico. Some bacteria or virus knocked me out for two weeks once I returned from Mexico and I barely was able to publish the daily doors on the ad-hoc blog I created. As I got healthy again I had a big hacking session and managed to get HiF back online the way you see it now - still not really how it used to look like or how I would like it to look, but better than a 404. During February and March I will try to update the layout and looks, but first there’s some other priorities.</p>

<h2 id="yeps-theres-gonna-be-a-new-blog">Yeps, there’s gonna be a new blog</h2>
<p>Hiking in Finland will continue &amp; will be regularly updated in the future, but my new website Hike Climb Travel will see a lot more action. Hike Climb Travel is much broader in name as Hiking in Finland and reflects that I do much more than hiking &amp; backpacking in Finland. Hiking in Finland will be home to my adventures at home and neighbouring countries, while Hike Climb Travel will be my outlet for everything that does take place outside of my beautiful home country. It will kick off some time in February, with a pretty, responsive layout, a great brand identity and some great stories to get you hooked. The best way to stay informed about when the new blog goes online is to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.us2.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=b29c2acd04d959eace48da780&amp;id=46b5d0326f">subscribe to the Newsletter</a> and follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hendrikmorkel">Youtube</a>, but no worries, I also will let it be known here.</p>

<p>For some time I will try to work on both blogs, but time will show if that is possible &amp; smart or if I just move everything over to the new website. Thus, if there’s a favourite article here on the Olde Blog, now is a good time to save it as a pdf for future references. Some content will will also be moved over, so no worries that it’s gonna be all lost down the aether.</p>

<h2 id="twir-is-not-dead">TWIR is (Not?) Dead</h2>
<p>A couple of weeks back I asked on Instagram and Facebook for one reason why you follow me and a large part of the answers included TWIR. But a lot has changed since I started The Week In Review six years ago: I got married, have two wonderful kids and a house that still needs a wee bit of renovation (not to mention the garden). I feel I have neglected my family the last years every Sunday for several hours while writing the TWIR, and with a little daughter of one year I (maybe too late) realised it is time to kill The Week in Review, reclaim my Sundays and spend them with the people that matter the most to me - my wife and kids.</p>

<p>Also, The Week In Review is a popular post but it never generated much of income for me. I tried to monetise it in some tasteful ways by affiliate links to offers that matter to you, and a couple of times the Packrafting Store sponsored an issue, but these were not putting enough €$£ into my pocket for the time I invest into the TWIR. Because I know that so many of you love the TWIR and rely on it to find new, relevant content that matters, I am open to suggestions on how we could keep the Week In Review alive - but it would be published then on Mondays as I want to have a weekend. Maybe a PayPal subscription would be an option, but that would mean some of you would need to start to pay for the TWIR content. If you think that’s something you’d be willing to do, leave a comment underneath - and also other ideas and feedback is welcome.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31674881554/in/dateposted/" title="Ice River floating"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/700/31674881554_9d690dd7bb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ice River floating" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>All in all I am very happy to have this off my chest. I felt bad leaving you loyal readers in the dark about this since last December, but now that I typed it down and re-read it a couple of times it feels good and I am happy to hit publish and see how you take these changes. Thus, comment away - here or on the Social Media channels you can find me on!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>I really missed talking to you. Twelve months is a long time of radio-silence, and I have a lot to tell you. Like all the awesome trips I have been on this year, from <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/05/lyngen.html">Ski-touring in Lyngen</a> to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/autumn-backpacking-in-the-dolomites.html">backpacking in the Dolomites</a>, 2016 has been fantastic. I spent great moments <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-the-bregenzerwald.html">with my family in the mountains</a>, and am looking very much forward to winter backpacking and other adventures.</p>

<p>But lets get down to business and start talking about the holiday season and the awesome <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/advent-calendar-2016/">Hiking in Finland Advent Calendar</a>. I saw it was again very nicely filled with prizes worth over 5.000€, and what better way to celebrate an awesome #HiFAdventCalendar season than with a sweet ADZHiFASO package from some small companies!</p>

<p><a href="https://whoopieslings.com/">whoopieslings.com</a> make a complete Hammock and Tarp Suspension Systems, and as I decided to give hammocks another chance what would be better than having a smart suspension system for it? A set of 6” whoopie slings, a pair of 6’ tree huggers and a pair of toggles should make setting up my hammock a breeze!</p>

<p>Similar to hammocking I think it is time to step up my trailrunning again! A <a href="http://www.ks-ultralightgear.com/p/blog-page_13.html">VRV8 Pack</a> from KS ultralight gear would be ideal for that - the pack is super simple yet efficient and packs all I need for a day out running in the forests and hills. It carries my poles, soft flasks or water bottles, and 8 l of gear fit into the main compartment, all with restricting movement.</p>

<p>One thing I have learned which should always be along is a pair of rain mitts. The <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=37&amp;products_id=51">Mountain Laurel Design eVent Rain Mitts</a> are the lightest rain mitts on the market and rumour has it that if one carries a pair rain usually doesn’t bother one when outside, so they’re kind of a good charm, too!</p>

<p>Also a pair of <a href="https://goosefeetgear.com/products/1-down-socks">GooseFeet Gear Down Socks</a> have been on my list for a long time - not just because I get awfully could feet at camp in winter, but also because they pack so tiny &amp; light when I’m hiking throughout the day. Filled with 850 fill power DownTek down these socks keep me toasty on my winter adventures, which is especially great after a long day in boots!</p>

<p>And finally, a <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/32-oz-wide-bottle#92=20">32 oz Wide Mouth Bottle</a> from Hydro Flask would be swell - not just for plenty of coffee the whole day but also for keeping drinks cold in the heat. It is BPA-Free, Toxin-Free and comes with a Lifetime Warranty - so this would be the last bottle I’d ever ask for!</p>

<p><em>To win this sweet prize package</em> just enter via the Rafflecopter Widget below:</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>also for freeriding and ski-touring lighter means better: A lighter ski, boot and backpack allows you to skin up in more comfort &amp; faster, while at the same time preserving energy for the ride down. <a href="https://www.mammut.ch/">Mammut</a> updated their <a href="https://www.mammut.ch/INT/en/B2C-Kategorie/Skiing-Boarding/Ride-Removable-Airbag-3-0/p/2610-01250-0001-1030">Ride Removable Airbag 3.0 Backpack</a> which got even lighter this year, with the Removable Airbag System 3.0 getting even more compact &amp; dependable while remaining just as removable and transferable to other compatible packs as before. The airbag system itself is just 690 g and with a carbon cartridge it tips the scales at barely over 1 kg. The 30l backpack on the other hand fits enough gear for a long day in the mountains, with a front pocket for avalanche safety equipment &amp; a padded google pocket, it carries skis or a snowboard and an integrated helmet carrier carries the helmet when skinning up, too. All in all it’s a might fine pack and Airbag System that helps to keep me safe during deep powder days where the avalanche risk is high! Now lets hope that this winter is going to be better than the last one!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>you know what I like (you probably do by now =)? Small companies which make innovative gear. <a href="http://www.paramo-clothing.de/">Páramo</a> is such a company, which not only designs &amp; makes great garments for outdoor activities, they also do good and foster ethical &amp; sustainable production. Take their <a href="">Enduro Jacket</a> for example, which is made from their directional Nikwax Analogy Waterproof fabric. It is Made in Colombia, is 100% PFC Free, at the end of its long life it can be recycled via the Páramo Recycling Scheme and the company helps to fund conservation projects across the globe. That’s a lot of good things a single jacket can do for people, planet and the one wearing it. Made for the mountains the Enduro can accompany one ski-touring and alpine climbing with its great freedom of movement, while the many pockets keep important kit close at hand. The large peak on the helmet-compatible hood keeps snow and rain at bay, and large arm vents help to stay cool when skinning up a mountain. And after a long season of use &amp; fun it can be made like new again by washing it with Nikwax products! Yeps, that are exactly the kind of things I like and wish there would be more from!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rutalocura.com/">Ruta Locura</a> is one of those small cottages which know their trade and their ultralight materials, in in their case that’s carbon fibre. Josh has been building since the mid-2000s carbon fibre and titanium goods for ultralight backpackers, campers, fishermen and hunters alike, and their <a href="http://www.rutalocura.com/trekking_poles.html">Yana Trekking Poles</a> are some of the most versatile poles on the market. Not just are they great to pitch Pyramid shelters and tarps at the end of the day, they also can be transformed into a tenkara rod when you want to add some trout to the Menu in the evening! The poles are also light, as you would expect, and so durable that a pair should last with some proper care and maintenance at least half a lite time!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Winter is also the time for wearing toasty warm down jackets. But down does not equal down, and hence we as consumers need to sometimes steer companies into the right direction. One company which doesn’t need steering but is leading in responsibly manufactured down is <a href="http://www.mountain-equipment.de">Mountain Equipment</a> with their <a href="http://www.thedowncodex.co.uk">Down Codex</a>. Since many years they offer customers the ability to 100% trace the down in their sleeping bags and jackets, which means one can have peace of mind in knowing that the down which keeps one warm was gathered with animal welfare in mind. So back to that toasty jacket I mentioned: With winters being warmer in the last few years a jacket like the <a href="http://www.mountain-equipment.de/arete-hooded-jacket">Men’s Arete Hooded Jacket</a> is ideal for the temperatures one encounters in our winters. The 320 g light jacket comes with two zippered pockets for cold hands &amp; camera batteries, and the hood ensures also ears and neck don’t need to freeze. Best of all: The water-resistant down doesn’t collapse when the snow turns to slush, and with some smart layering one could use this down jacket all year around!</p>
