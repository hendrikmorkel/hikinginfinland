<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Quilts are what we ultralight backpackers &amp; climbers love most. Not only are they way lighter than a sleeping bag, but the freedom of movement and ease of use are at least as important. <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/">Enlightened Equipment</a> makes some of the most innovative <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/quilts/">quilts</a> on the market, and almost all of their quilts are Made-to-Order exactly like one wants it. Extra down and a slim cut? No problem! Synthetic insulation and a wide foot box? Also no problem! Tim and his employees are able to fulfil almost every wish when it comes to quilts, and once you have slept under an Enlightened Equipment Quilt you won’t ever go back to a sleeping bag!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Winter, that’s ski-touring season for me. I love to skin up a lonely mountain with a good friend or two, enjoy a warm cup of tea at the summit before dropping in and enjoying fresh powder &amp; untouched slopes on the way back to the valley. On a trip like this a good-fitting and functional ski-touring backpack is mandatory, and the <a href="http://www.marmot.de/content/en/collection_36&amp;c=892">Backcountry 32 Pack</a> from <a href="http://www.marmot.de/">Marmot</a> ticks those boxes very well. When you need to Bootpack it carries the skis in a A-Frame or diagonally, a Shovel and Probe Pocket give fast access to the essential tools when needed and the ergonomically designed shoulder harness makes the pack comfortably to carry all day long. Add in that it is light and durably made and you have pack that you’re looking forward to to carry when you get early in the morning to climb up a mountain!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>December is the darkest month of the year, when the days get shorter and shorter until the winter solstice. That’s not ideal for being outdoors here up in the north, but that’s where <a href="http://www.suprabeam.com/">Suprabeam</a> comes in: With their <a href="http://www.suprabeam.com/uk/products/v3air">V3air Headlamp</a> and the <a href="http://www.suprabeam.com/uk/products/q3defend">Q3defend Torch</a> we bring light into the December darkness and can pursue our outdoor activities in the bright light of this headlamp and torch! The V3air is just 140 g but boost up to 250 Lumens, enough to shine up to 195 m far. The Q3defend Torch is even more powerful and also very versatile, and also waterproof! With these two lamps the darkness can come, because we’re ready for it!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.icebug.com/">ICEBUG</a> hails from Sweden and if they know one thing then it is how to have good grip on slippery surfaces like ice and snow when you’re out running. The <a href="http://int-shop.icebug.com/springa/40-49/dubbade/anima5-m-bugrip">Anima5 BUGrip</a> is a dream come true for us ultralight backpackers and trailrunners as one shoe tips the scales at 280 g in a Size 7.5! Add in plenty of durable Carbide Tips which will bite into the hardest snow &amp; ice to guarantee great grip as well as the weather shield membrane which is laminated to the backside of the upper textile and which prevents snow, cold air and slush to your feet when conditions are getting rough, and you have a shoe which is made for running in the North from October to April!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>remember that I told you a while ago that one never can have enough backpacks? With the <a href="http://www.vaude.com/en-NL/Products/Backpacks/Citus-24-LW-lava.html#">Citus 24 LW Backpack</a> from <a href="http://www.vaude.com/">VAUDE</a> that is certainly true, because a 500 g light pack that’s also very environmentally friendly is definitely worth having for day hikes and overnighters. It’s ventilated back and the ventilated shoulder straps &amp; hipbelt makes it ideal for hot environments - like hiking in Spain and Portugal. Two stretchy side pockets pack water &amp; snacks for easy access on the go, and the reflective details make one visible when hiking late at night back to the village. A durable pack that’s made from sustainable materials, resource-efficient manufacturing and fair production - a triple win thus!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Something Ultralight backpackers love more than cuben and carbon is titanium. Durable, light and pretty, that’s very understandable I’d say. And as the <a href="https://www.trekking-lite-store.com">Trekking-Lite-Shop.com</a> garners to the needs and wants of ultralight backpackers it is no surprise that they also carry a fine array of titanium goodies. Two of these which took my fancy are the <a href="https://www.trekking-lite-store.com/kueche/kocher/11096/toaks-ultralight-titanium-cook-system-cs02-mit-650-ml-topf">Toaks Ultralight Titanium Cook System CS02</a> and the <a href="https://www.trekking-lite-store.com/kueche/geschirr/11105/toaks-titan-tasse-375-ml-cup">Toaks Ti Cup</a>, because as fast it is to boil water with a gas stove so noisy is it, and heavy they are, too. Not so the  Toaks Ultralight Titanium Cook System CS02, which tips the scales at a light 166 g and boils water with denatured alcohol in a silent and fast manner. The Ti Cup is just the right size to enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning or a hot chocolate in the evening while the food is getting ready in the bigger pot. All in all a great setup which doesn’t weigh one down!</p>

<p><a title="Advent Calendar TLZ Toaks Prize" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31581257835/in/dateposted/"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/1/610/31581257835_1155a55dcb_b.jpg" alt="Advent Calendar TLZ Toaks Prize" width="1024" height="768" /></a></p>

<p>I love to climb when I’m not hiking, and what does one need for climbing? Right, a rope! Happily the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/?pid=10239">Bergfreunde</a> have a wide variety of ropes, and what’s better than a rope for a dirtbag climber? Exactly, a great rope for a good price with something on top! The <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/edelrid-daku-100-bergfreunde-edition/?pid=10239">Edelrid Daku 10.0</a> Bergfreunde Edition Rope is such a rope - it’s not just affordable and high-quality, the 10.0 diameter is ideal for projecting and the included ropebag means it stays clean and is easy to transport! It’s just what I need for sports climbing and mixed &amp; ice climbs, so I hope to find one under the Christmas tree soon!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>when you go out with your partner or friends, as I was writing yesterday, having a stove along which allows you to cook &amp; boil water for both at the same time is a huge benefit. No one wants to wait after a winter day in the hills for a hot cup of tea, so a group stove system should be along to make the stay more pleasant. The <a href="http://www.eoe-europe.com/Produkte/Kocher/Palladium/palladium.html">Palladium Stove</a> is a powerful titanium gas stove which offers a solid place for large pans and pots - like those in the  <a href="http://www.eoe-europe.com/Produkte/Geschirr/Zirkon/zirkon.html">Zirkon Set</a>! With a 800 ml and a 1200 ml pot and two pans one can cook a feast outdoors - and thanks to the included sponge the clean-up isn’t a problem, either! Rounding out this lightweight set is the <a href="http://www.eoe-europe.com/Produkte/Zubehor/Bulbul/bulbul.html">Bulbul</a> windscreen, which ensures the Palladium stove can work as efficiently as possible. With this stove set along it’s easy &amp; fun to cook for your partner or a group, making any outdoor trip even more memorable!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>the best way to enjoy the outdoors is with your partner - because sitting back at home and reminiscing about great adventures together creates great bonds for life. And while sharing one backpack certainly is in the sense of ultralight backpacking, sometimes it is easier when everyone carries their own pack. <a href="http://www.partioaitta.fi/">Partioaitta</a> helps with finding the right pack for everyone, for example the <a href="http://www.partioaitta.fi/osprey-tempest-30">Osprey Tempest 30</a> for her or the <a href="http://www.partioaitta.fi/osprey-talon-33">Osprey Talon 33</a> for him. Both are comfortable to carry, have large front mesh pockets and stretchy side pockets, and pack all the gear one needs for day hikes. Add in that they are both lightweight and durable, and you have a companion for life - just like your backpacking partner!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>as I just returned from an amazing two weeks in Mexico you can imagine that I’m missing me some good Mexican food. A good thing is that <a href="https://www.trekneat.com/">Trek’n Eat</a> has a Quinoa Mexican Style which brings the flavours of Mexico along on my hikes in Europe, spicing up my winter adventures here in the north. And as I am always hungry and hate to wait for my food, the <a href="https://www.optimusstoves.com/de/de/274-8016163-optimus-crux-lite-solo-cook-system">Optimus Crux Lite Solo System</a> is an ideal companion for me, as it boils water and melts snow in minutes, which means I never need to wait too long for my meal! And what would be a meal without a cold bottle of water, especially on hot Mexican days? Right! The <a href="https://www.katadyn.com/de/de/14947-8019946-katadyn-beefree-water-filtration-system_eu">Katadyn BeFree</a> Water Filtration System is an all-in-one water bottle with water filter. The system is so easy and light that I even carry it along in Finland, where you generally can drink the clean water from any lake!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>what I like almost more than ultralight backpacking nowadays is photography. Capturing moments, be it shadows &amp; light in the the city or sunsets in the mountains, just gives me an immense fulfilment &amp; happiness. But carrying my gear around in a frameless backpack doesn’t, and as <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/?acc=97">Peak Design</a> announced their <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/product/bags/everyday-backpack/?acc=97">Everyday Backpack</a> I knew that this is the one pack to carry my photography gear, in town, the forests and mountains, on plane trips and strolls through the city. It allows me to not just carry my camera, but also my Drone and Mac as well as a few lenses and more. Add in that it is weatherproof on the outside, has 3 FlexFold Dividers which allow endless internal configuration on the inside and has very comfortable straps and you know that is the one photography backpack to take everywhere!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Ultralight backpacking is all about multi-use and reducing the kit you can carry. The <a href="http://www.astucas.com/sestrals-poncho">Sestrals Poncho</a> from Spanish cottage manufacturer <a href="http://www.astucas.com/">As Tucas</a> is such piece, as it lets me leave my insulation jacket at home and I can wear the quilt as a poncho in camp - great multi-use! It also can be transformed into a sleeping bag and blanket, which makes it a truly versatile piece of equipment! Add in that it’s made from some of the best materials available - schoeller-ftc fabric with the ecorepel finish and a Climashield APEX insulation.</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>The <a href="http://bit.ly/2gTYeRB">Summit Pack</a> from <a href="http://bit.ly/1QQRFL2">Hyperlite Mountain Gear</a> is one of the lightest packs the company from Maine, USA, makes. The 360 g light pack is ideal for summit pushes from basecamps or day hikes in the mountains. The 30 l volume is big enough for larger loads on longer days, while the adjustable shoulder straps will ensure it’s comfortable to carry all day long. Four external daisy chains let me attach even more gear, while the Roll-Top closure and the Dyneema® Poly hybrid material ensures the content of the pack stay dry. With this pack the next winter summit attempt or dayhike can come! <a title="Advent Calendar Hyperlite Mountain Gear Summit Pack" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30581992354/in/dateposted/"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5579/30581992354_836dab1a1f_z.jpg" alt="Advent Calendar Hyperlite Mountain Gear Summit Pack" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>I love to find out about small, new companies which offer unique solutions to exisiting products. <a href="http://swisspiranha.com">SwissPiranha</a> from Switzerland is such a company, as they have made tent pegs better. What I probably like best is that the SwissPiranha pegs uses 13 times less energy for manufacturing &amp; recycling than tent pegs made out of aluminium. The Piranha NT plastic also does not break, and if it does bend you can heat it in the oven and bend it back into shape! They’re made in Switzerland, too - a country well know for quality, precision and functionality! The <a href="http://swisspiranha.com/products/rt150-swisspiranha-150mm/10er-150-img_6835.html">SwissPiranha RT150</a> is your work-horse peg for all types of camping, while the <a href="http://swisspiranha.com/products/rt220-swisspiranha-220mm/6er-220.html">SwissPiranha RT220</a> and <a href="http://swisspiranha.com/products/new-snow-and-sand-anchor/the-easy-way-to-set-and.html">SwissPiranha Snow and Sand Anchor</a> are great for more extreme undergrounds.

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>I long have been waiting for <a href="http://www.arcteryx.com">Arc’teryx</a> to make Merino wool baselayers. The waiting has ended and the <a href="http://www.arcteryx.com/product.aspx?country=fi&amp;language=en&amp;gender=mens&amp;model=Satoro-AR-Crew-Neck-Shirt-LS">Arc’teryx Satoro AR Crew Baselayer</a> have now finally arrived, but these wouldn’t be from Arc’teryx if they wouldn’t be special. Because Merino wool is sensitive - I have countless baselayers to proof this - The Satoro AR utilizes the Core Spun Wool Technology. This technology combines 18.3 micron Merino wool fibres spun around a nylon core filament, making them more durable and abrasion resistant. They thus combine the best of natural and synthetic fibres, and come with the great Arc’teryx fit which I love so much! <a title="Advent Calendar Arc'teryx Satoro AR Crew" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31289784471/in/dateposted/"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/6/5766/31289784471_6c91296afb_z.jpg" alt="Advent Calendar Arc'teryx Satoro AR Crew" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><em>One can never have enough backpacks!</em> goes a famous saying in the ultralight community, and I feel like I could add another pack to my collection. As it went I happened to find the <a href="http://www.lundhags.com/Products/Backpacks/Trekking-Packs/Termik-42/(color)/606">Termik 42 Backpack</a> from <a href="http://www.lundhags.com">Lundhags</a>. Lundhags is a Swedish company which has a long tradition in the outdoors, and their Termik 42 daypack reflects those many years of knowledge. The pack is durable, highly waterproof and has in the back an air gap which helps keeping the back of the wearer dry. Add in great, stretchy side pockets and a low weight, and I think this would be a great pack for future hikes in summer in winter through the beautiful nature of Scandinavia! <a title="Advent Calendar Lundhags Termik" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31366696596/in/dateposted/"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5521/31366696596_ec5d5e86c3_z.jpg" alt="Advent Calendar Lundhags Termik" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>

<p>Welcome again to a new Hiking in Finland Advent Calendar! Like in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/advent-calendar-2014/">years</a> <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/advent-calendar-2015/">before</a>, a good set of rules makes running the Advent Calendar a lot easier for everyone involved. Read them carefully and everything hopefully will be clear, and for some added benefit check out the <strong>tips</strong> at the end!</p>

<p>This years calendar will run 25 days (= 25 Doors), and behind each door you will find a fine piece of brand-new gear which should make your next outdoor adventure fun and ultralight. Some information on the prizes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All prizes are sent directly from the company providing them (which can mean that you might need to pay import duties when it comes from abroad!).</li>
  <li>Sometimes it is possible that you can choose size, colour and other variables. Where this is the case, it will be mentioned in the text of the Door.</li>
  <li>This means garments can be either female or male, backpacks can be different torso sizes and meals can be vegetarian or with meat.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-rules">The Rules</h2>

<p>To win something you should check in each day here and enter the raffle. There are a couple of points to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You only can win once. If you don’t win one day, you should try your luck the next day - you got 25 chances!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am using a paid-for version of <a href="https://www.rafflecopter.com/">Rafflecopter</a> for the Give-Aways. With Rafflecopter you can get multiple entries by following someone on Instagram, Twitter, visit a page on Facebook, follow a Pinterest page or susbscribe to a Mailing List. This increases your chances to win, but is not mandatory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Rafflecopter Widget is integrated with <a href="http://www.random.org/">Random.org</a> and it choses the winner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you won, I contact you via the provided Email address and you have 24 hours to reply. If I don’t hear from you, I imagine you don’t want the item and will let Random.org chose a new winner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Posts go online around midnight and the raffles close at midnight - Finnish time. Rafflecopter then will show the name of the winner after I pushed that button, this keeps posts to a minimum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is open to everyone. As in from Australia to Zimbabwe, prices are send everywhere (unless noted otherwise).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possible Import Duty taxes and fees are paid by the winner. If you’re not willing to pay these, don’t compete.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can’t bribe me or anyone involved to win. You use the item(s) on your own responsibility. Use common sense.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You can participate via the Rafflecopter widget by registering with your Email or your Facebook accoount. Please make sure for either option that it’s an Email address you regularly check, so when I contact you you get the email.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is usually one mandatory option to answer to participate. This can be something fun or a question about the price in question. You should be easily able to answer the question by reading the text or visiting the manufacturer website.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can get additional entries which improve your chances of winning. This could be visiting a Facebook page or following someone on Youtube, Twitter, Instagram and the like. It’s a good thing to do, and also allows you stay up-to-date with news about the HiF Advent Calendar and the company sponsoring the prize.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you think your friends and fans would like to participate - spread the word! Use the #HifAdventCalendar hashtag on Instagram, Twitter &amp; Facebook when you spread the word =)</p>
  </li>
</ol>
