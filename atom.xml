    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For 10+ years, I haven’t worn any jeans. But in autumn 2019 the DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans arrived with me, and in the past two winters they have become my go-to trousers. So much so, that I am wearing it now since four months (and yes, that means it hasn’t been in the wash that long!).</p>

<p>Since around 2008 I haven’t worn a pair of jeans. My last jeans were from an Italian brand, but even when I still owned them I didn’t wear them much. My trousers, or pants, whatever you like to call them, were made from another fabric than denim. Mostly Polyester, but also linen, cotton and other synthetic fabrics were what I liked to wear, and actually still do for most of the year. But in the autumn of 2019 the <a href="https://bit.ly/3s2D4m2">∞ DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans</a> appeared at my porch, and while I was sceptical at first - I love my Houdini pants to bits - I also was curious to try these jeans, as they feature a water repellant and breathable membrane underneath the denim fabric.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50808928773/in/dateposted/" title="DUER All-Weather Denim"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50808928773_56706b96d0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DUER All-Weather Denim" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809668396/in/dateposted/" title="Instructions // DUER All-Weather Denim"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809668396_7edd02e6f8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Instructions // DUER All-Weather Denim" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The denim fabric is what makes DUER jeans special, as it is not 100% cotton, but the fabric is called L2X Denim and consists of 70% Cotton, 28% Coolmax (that’s made from Polyester) and 2% Lycra. This makes the jeans more stretchy and rather comfortable to wear, especially for cycling. The denim fabric also has a Silvadur treatment, that’s a bacterial inhibition treatment to extend the time you can wear the jeans without washes. Right now, as depicted on the photos in this article, the jeans has been worn daily for four months without that it has been in the washing machine. My regular Houdini trousers I wear anywhere between two and four weeks, then it simply is too obvious that I have been wearing the pants for a long time because you can see dirt on them. These DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans have a quite dark fabric, which “hides” dirt easier, but it probably also helps that I usually wear them when it starts to get around 0°C and so there isn’t too much mud &amp; dirt around - it’s pretty much all frozen when I wear them.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809786542/in/dateposted/" title="DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans Pockets n Stuff"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809786542_6d8a11887e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans Pockets n Stuff" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Because these pants have a membrane on the inside underneath the denim fabric - that membrane has a water resistance rating of 18.150 mm and a Moisture Vapor Transmission Rate (MVTR) rating of 13.000 G/M2/M24hrs - these are WARM 🔥 pants. It has to be -5°C or more and really windy for me to put on some <a href="https://tidd.ly/3b8r7VS">∞ long underwear</a> on underneath them, for temperatures above that the pants are warm enough on their own for me. This makes them really great winter pants in my opinion, as this membrane in combination with the DUER L2X Denim is giving me a pair of trousers which keep wind and snow at bay and me toasty and warm, all while looking like a regular pair of jeans. I can not wear these jeans if it’s above 5°C, as then I simply run to hot, so for me this is a cold weather jeans. However, it is comfortable also when inside - the usual inside temperature in Finland is around 22°C - and if you’re not exercising on a bike indoors with these jeans on, then you should feel just fine - that’s where the <em>breathability</em> of the membrane comes in handy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809669991/in/dateposted/" title="DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans Back"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809669991_e11b9f5fd7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans Back" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Alright, they only almost look like a regular pair of jeans, as they have some smart details which make them stand out a wee bit. One detail is the reflective DU/ER logo font on the inside of the trouser legs (it’s called a cuff, I’m told =), which makes you more visible in traffic in the dark. This is a wonderful detail and really useful in dark Finland &amp; Scandinavia, and once you’d arrive at the office, library or Café you could just roll the trouser leg down to hide the reflective detail again. Me, I keep them up, all the time. The pants are a length of 32” and rolled up it’s the perfect length for me, and stops just around my ankle.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809669601/in/photostream/" title="Cycling with the DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809669601_896a9fc249_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cycling with the DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There’s also a reflective logo patch at the waistband, so in case you aren’t wearing a reflector like every smart non-suicidal person in the North should in winter, you also could be seen via it if you have your jacket that high up. I don’t but then I have a reflector or two on my jacket. Other features include triple stitched inseams, gussets and back rises, so during all that cycling nothing rips open, double layered back pockets which should be equally durable and long-lasting, and in case you’re wondering: Yes, this is a five pocket jeans, and I’m wearing mine in the Slim Cut (there’s a <a href="https://bit.ly/3q1263g">∞ Relaxed Jeans</a> available, too).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809668926/in/dateposted/" title="DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans front"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809668926_602254a21c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans front" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>These are my go-to pants in winter, usually between late September and around late March, when it starts to get warm again. During these six-ish months I happily put on my DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans every day, and go cycling to the grocery store, walking and sledding with the kids, for a walk in the forest or visit a Café in town for a tasty coffee and some Pulla. They have great freedom of movement - they were made as a cycling jeans, after all - and look rather stylish, but the real selling point for me is that these jeans are made to be outside in cold weather, and that they don’t need to be washed that often. That’s good for the environment in several ways, and as these pants are made to last, I expect them to keep my toasty for another eight or nine winters!</p>

<p>If you’d like to grab a pair for yourself - they are available as a Men’s and <a href="https://bit.ly/3bhwthz">∞ Women’s version</a> - order them either directly from <a href="https://bit.ly/3s2D4m2">∞ DUER</a> if you’re in North America, in Europe you can get them from <a href="https://tidd.ly/3b7VbRz">∞ Bergzeit</a> and in Finland from <a href="https://varuste.net/p99564/duer-all-weather-performance-denim-slim-jeans">Varuste</a>.</p>

<p>Behind me lay the solitude of the Hetta-Pallas Trail, in front of me was <a href="https://www.yllas.fi/en/home-page.html">Ylläs</a> and Äkäslompolo with it’s many different options of fun in the snow. My new friends dropped me off at the <a href="https://sevenfellshostel.com/en/7-fells-hostel-eng/">7 Fells Hostel</a>, where I moved my stuff into the cozy little cabin which was waiting for me. Outside the sun was setting, but that didn’t stop me from a short stroll to explore the surroundings a bit more. Äkäslompolo is a compact and cozy village, probably one of the best Finnish winter villages as it is home to both the largest ski resort in Finland as well as a very extensive XC skiing network with over 400 km of Tracks. Add in superb possibilities for skitouring, Fatbiking and winter hiking, and you understand why this little village is so popular with winter lovers.</p>

<h2 id="fatbiking-in-ylls">Fatbiking in Ylläs</h2>

<p>The next morning brought clear and sunny skies, and it was an easy decision to head back out into the cold again. Going outside makes my life better, it’s a way to disconnect for hours from Social Media and the internet, and to do something which I like a lot better than sitting in front of a screen: Being in nature, breathing fresh, cold air, feeling the sun and wind on my cheeks. I decided to go for a Fatbike ride, as I could loan a Fatbike from the friendly folks of the 7 Fells Hostel, and they have a really nice Fatbike Trail network in Ylläs! I rode through the village, past the supermarket, Cafés and sports shops, towards the start of the trails.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802510028/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Riding"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802510028_f7dec84430_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Riding" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803257031/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Getting all the Infos"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803257031_d265ccc9be_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Getting all the Infos" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>It was a warm and sunny day, the temperature was +2°C and it was perfect for riding the Fatbike. There were very few people around - this was just at the start of the first Lockdown of 2020 in Finland, and pretty much only locals were around, as well as a very few visitors. I decided to ride to the Kesänkijärvi Laavu - five years ago I went skitouring on Kesänki and I have really good memories of this fjell, and at least seeing it from the lake would make me happy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803257121/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Which way?"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803257121_26715d4e57_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Which way?" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803257446/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Handlebar."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803257446_ee278c4088_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Handlebar." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But that wasn’t the only thing which made me happy. Riding in this warm weather, in the sun, on empty Fatbike trails, through young birch forests, over swamps and always with the beautiful hills in view, also made me happy. Really happy 😊</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803257751/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="&lt;Mountain"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803257751_47899021f8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="&lt;Mountain" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803373287/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Palls-Yllästunturi National Park"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803373287_fe507071fd_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Palls-Yllästunturi National Park" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Soon I entered the Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park, where the trails became a bit more narrow, and I was hollering and smiling as I rode through the forest, past the lake shore and towards the wee Laavu at the end of the trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803373447/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Closed Laavu"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803373447_dbe1030b09_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Closed Laavu" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At the Kesänki Laavu a thin line of smoke was rising from the fire pit. A large yellow sign was hanging at the top of the Laavu, telling visitors in Finnish, Swedish and English that it was closed because of COVID-19. I had a small sip of water from my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/hydro-flask-standard-mouth-with-standard-flex-cap-isolierflasche/?pid=10239">∞ bottle</a>, took a few bites from my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/clif-bar-clif-nut-butter-filled-chocolate-hazelnut-butter-energieriegel/?pid=10239">∞ Nut Butter Clif Bar</a> and explored the surroundings. There’s a Café across the XC Tracks - which also was closed - where there were two persons, who were, like me, enjoying the sun and silence.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802512608/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Closed Café"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802512608_fe64e153f3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Closed Café" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I was tempted to ride back over the lake, but thought better of it and came the same way - it was a good single track over all, and as it was warm and a yellow sign was warning me that the track over the lake was closed, I opted for the safe alternative. Longingly I watched back towards the hills, wishing I could go ski-touring on them in this grand weather…</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803259061/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Wee Hills"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803259061_c6f1f007ab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Wee Hills" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="skitouring-to-kuertunturi">Skitouring to Kuertunturi</h2>

<p>The next morning was already my last full day in Äkäslompolo, and the weather was grey. Let me be honest: I slept in, had a long breakfast, was reading and at some point in the early afternoon decided I better make the best use of my time here in the snow of Lapland - back home there was no snow, after all. So I packed my gear, put on my <a href="https://tidd.ly/3nn9nIY">∞ ski boots</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/pXmXznusheI">backpack</a> and skinned up Kuertunturi, which rises up just behind my Cabin at the 7 Fells Hostel. Half-way up I also shot a short video about dressing for ski-touring:</p>

<p>Then my <a href="https://www.dpsskis.com/collections/men/products/wailer_a100_rp">skis</a> and <a href="https://tidd.ly/3pSa5zu">∞ contour Hybrid skins</a> brought me further up the hill. OK, maybe my legs also had something to contribute…</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803371057/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Skis"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803371057_ee46c318d8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Skis" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802513378/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Top"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802513378_e81d700825_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Top" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At the top of this easy hill - there’s also a well-marked winter hiking trail going to the summit - I found good weather and amazing views. I had a clear view towards the closed Ylläs ski resort, Kesänki and Lainiotunturi and the over 50 km distant Pallastunturi hills, which I skied across just a few days prior! It was an absolutely stunning scenery which lay around me, and if the sun wouldn’t have been setting already I probably would have stayed longer to enjoy my last evening in Lapland from the summit of a fjell.</p>

<p>But as the sun was already setting, and my descent through the forest was in the shadow, I decided to head back down. I had some good turns, some ice, some fun moments and some pushing across a frozen swamp before I was back at my cabin, where a warm shower and a tasty <a href="https://tidd.ly/3rUiV1m">∞ LYO Food meal</a> were waiting for me. As well as some packing, but at least that’s something which I have down pretty well!</p>

<h2 id="visiting-ylls">Visiting Ylläs</h2>

<p>Your first stop should be the <a href="https://www.yllas.fi/en/news/corona-info">Ylläs Corona Info Website</a> and the <a href="https://koronaturvallinenlappi.fi/en/home/">Coronavirus situation in Lapland</a> website, which inform you both about the hygiene concept in Ylläs and the ski resort as well as the current COVID-19 situation in all of Lapland. Personally I would avoid the “busy” weeks and go when very few people are in Lapland, to minimize the risk of getting exposed and/ or putting a strain on the health care system. You yourself obviously should either have a negative PCR Test that is not older than three days or already received the vaccine. If that is all in order: Plan your trip!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802510513/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="My Cabin at the 7 Fells Hostel"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802510513_47c2045f74_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="My Cabin at the 7 Fells Hostel" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I stayed at the very stylish &amp; cozy <a href="https://sevenfellshostel.com/en/7-fells-hostel-eng/">7 Fells Hostel</a> which I can highly recommend, and also the <a href="https://yllaslodge.com/en/">Lodge 67˚N</a> gets good reviews. There are more <a href="https://www.yllas.fi/en/accommodation.html">accommodation options in Ylläs</a>, too, from Hotels to cabins in the woods. Ylläs has a host of <a href="https://www.yllas.fi/en/services.html">services</a>, from eating out over rental gear to shopping for groceries, so you can find everything in the village in case you forgot something or want to try XC skiing or Fatbiking!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803375862/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Busstop"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803375862_689c24eba9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Busstop" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>To the North and back South I travelled with <a href="https://www.onnibus.com/home">OnniBus</a>, <a href="https://www.matkahuolto.fi/en">local busses</a> and the <a href="https://www.vr.fi/en">train</a>, and while it is a long trip it is affordable, comfortable and takes less time than driving by car. If you have to get around in the village, there’s a ski bus and also taxis, so there really is no need for an own car.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802514333/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Road Home"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802514333_3f06d67995_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Road Home" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong> I think I spent again too few days in Ylläs. I still haven’t skied in its ski resort, and would love to go on more skitouring trips on the surrounding hills. Also the amazing XC Tracks are really inviting, so a longer trip to this hidden pearl is in order! What about you - have you been to Äkäslompolo and Ylläs?

<h2 id="big-trails-great-britain--ireland">Big Trails: Great Britain &amp; Ireland</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50743200828/in/photostream/" title="Big Trails Great Britain &amp; Ireland"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50743200828_827eb79e16_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Big Trails Great Britain &amp; Ireland" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This is my review copy of Vertebrate Publishing’s <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/walking/big-trails-great-britain-ireland/">Big Trails: Great Britain &amp; Ireland</a> book - I contributed a few images for the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/06/hiking-the-causeway-coast-way.html">Causeway Coast Way</a> in Northern Ireland to it! I might be biased thus, but this is an really good book to discover new trails and get really good information on them. The structure on how the trails are presented is very useful for future hikers, and starts off with a nice text presentation of the hike, as well as a map where in the UK or Ireland you can find this trail - and I really like that the trail is shown completely on this map, as that helps you get a feel for it. Beautiful photos make the trail look perfect and show what landscapes you can expect, which is followed by the Essential Information part: Here you get all the important information on how to get there, how long it might take to complete, the Pros &amp; Cons and where to find further information. A more detailed map of the complete trail also helps you plan the hike. There are 25 different Trails in this book, located in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and England. The trails are anything from 55 km in length to 300 km or more. If you find this book interesting but would rather stay in mainland Europe, then the sister book <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/walking/big-trails-heart-of-europe/">Big Trails: Heart of Europe</a> might be better for you.</p>

<p>Buy the book directly from <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/walking/big-trails-great-britain-ireland/">Vertebrate Publishing</a>, at your local book shop or order it from <a href="https://amzn.to/3h75cz8">∞ Amazon.com</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3auMaS2">∞ Amazon.co.uk</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2KOnKIn">∞ Amazon.de</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-last-hillwalker-bothy-tales-and-sky-dance">The Last Hillwalker, Bothy Tales and Sky Dance</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50744046602/in/photostream/" title="The Last Hillwalker, Bothy Tales and Skydance"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50744046602_bf9686d269_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Last Hillwalker, Bothy Tales and Skydance" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I bought these three books, maybe in part because they got so many good reviews, because Alex Roddie was the Editor for them, and also because I wanted something “easy” to read in the evening (I have read a lot of Science Fiction in the last months =). I wasn’t disappointed with these books, and they were really good entertainment. The only bad thing was that I always wanted to go sleep in a tent under a quilt, instead of a warm bed 😆. I first read <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/narratives/the-last-hillwalker/">The Last Hillwalker</a>, then <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/narratives/bothy-tales/">Bothy Tales</a> and then <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/narratives/narratives-sky-dance/">Sky Dance</a>, which is also the recommended order by the author.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/narratives/the-last-hillwalker/">The Last Hillwalker</a> was a very good book, and takes us along on John’s adventures of the past 40 years or hiking, climbing, backpacking and camping. I think for us younger hillwalking and hiking humans it’s fun to read how it was to start hillwalking and climbing 40+ years ago, as it is rather different than nowadays where you go online to find information, help and friends to go out with. The Stories in each chapter are entertaining, make you chuckle or think or both, and it’s tempting to read “just one more chapter” before heading to bed. The Last Hillwalker is a great book, and should give you a few good evenings of reading.</p>

<p>The second book, <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/narratives/bothy-tales/">Bothy Tales</a>, was a collection of short stories about Bothies, the open wilderness huts in the UK. This book was much shorter than the other two, and also the one I enjoyed the least. Maybe it was because it felt that most stories had the same elements: Hike in with a bag of coal to a distant bothy in the darkness, with rain or snow often also included, light a fire, make food, drink a dram. The book definitely had some fun moments - especially as my best friend’s name is also Martin, and we have experienced in the past 12 years similar situations as the protagonists of this book. Overall I felt this was a weaker book, but for a completionist probably still a must-read book.</p>

<p>John’s 3rd book, <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/narratives/narratives-sky-dance/">Sky Dance</a>, is his best work to date. It’s less autobiographical, less short stories, and more a really great novel. I had a hard time each evening putting the book down to go to sleep, as the story is really well written, captivating and also about an issue which is close to my heart. The two main characters, Angus &amp; Rory, are relatable and very likeable, and <em>“do what is right”</em>. With this book it feels John has grown as an author, and it makes me looking forward to <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/books-new-and-coming-soon/books-new-and-coming-soon-wild-winter/">his fourth book in April 2021</a>. You can read this book completely on its own, as you don’t need any of the information of the previous two books, but if you have read them some things will make you chuckle as there are smart call-backs to the previous works. Overall a great book that I can highly recommend!</p>

<p>Buy the three books directly from <a href="https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/bundles_3/bundles-3-john-d-burns-bundle/">Vertebrate Publishing</a>, at your local book shop or order it from <a href="https://amzn.to/2J9SPWL">∞ Amazon.com</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/37EsR77">∞ Amazon.co.uk</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/38hEIXG">∞ Amazon.de</a>.</p>

<h2 id="das-alpenbuch">Das Alpenbuch</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50743937486/in/photostream/" title="Das Alpenbuch"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50743937486_afb175f011_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Das Alpenbuch" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I received this Review copy of <a href="https://marmotamaps.com/en/book-of-the-alps/">The Book of the Alps</a> as my good friend Björn Köcher is one of the authors. This book, which is in German language, is a feast for the eyes. It has 46 chapters, which are sub-divided into seven subject areas: Geography, Flora and Fauna, Climate and Environment, Alpinism, Mountain Sports, Society and Economy and Arts and Culture. Every single page is jam-packed full of interesting information which are in turn depicted in easy-to-understand graphics, and <em>not just some graphics out of Word</em> but carefully crafted graphics which tell you about the different topics and issues. Be it which animal lives where on a mountain, a timeline of alpinism in the Alps or which ski length to pick for which art of skiing. This is a book which I read in the afternoon, between work sessions, with a cup of coffee, and I love to absorb the useful information and the pretty graphics. A fantastic book which I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about the Alps in Europe &amp; everything connected to them, as it is beautiful and full-to-the-brim with information for us outdoor enthusiasts.</p>

<h2 id="wanderlust-europe">Wanderlust Europe</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50743201188/in/photostream/" title="Wanderlust Europe"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50743201188_19f46b815f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Wanderlust Europe" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://gestalten.com/products/wanderlust-europe">Wanderlust Europe</a>. My (digital) friend <a href="https://www.alexroddie.com">Alex Roddie</a> wrote this visual tome of long hikes in Europe. Every trail is accompanied by a nice text which makes you curious about the trail in question, again with beautiful images to give you a feeling of what to expect. A map at the end of each Trail shows you where you’ll be hiking and helps with planning, as does the <em>Good to know</em> section which gives basic infos. This is as much a coffee table book which is nice to flip through while you’re relaxing, as it is a book to plan the next dozen long hikes you want to do in Europe. While this book showcases some of the best-known Trails in Europe which are already pretty busy (Kungsleden, The Pennine Way, Tre Cime Circuit, etc.) it also highlights some pretty new trails. If you’re new to the hobby of hiking &amp; backpacking, and don’t know where to go in your next summer holiday, this book will give you plenty to choose from!</p>

<p>In January 2002 I moved to Finland. Before I moved to this country in the North-East of Europe, I had visited the country and <a href="https://www.myhelsinki.fi/en/">capital Helsinki</a> a handful of times, and it always left me with a good feeling. The feeling that I could be who I want to be. Society didn’t care that I had long hairs, and I got the exact same treatment at the store like the young mother in her Marimekko dress and the bank clerk in a suit. I loved this feeling of being able to be me, like I wanted to be.</p>

<p>During my visits to Helsinki, and also living here for a bit while I was working at a sustainability startup and then in 2018 spending a wonderful summer in the capital with my kids while my wife worked at a Service Design Agency, this feeling of freedom to be and do grew. It is something I hugely appreciate: The possibility to life in the centre of the capital where I can put my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning shoes</a> on and go for a run in the city’s nature. Taking my small kids on a free boat trip to Suomenlinna and eat an ice cream (<em>if your child sits in a pram, you can use public transportation for free in Helsinki!</em>). Riding my bike on the extensive bike roads through the city. Walking safely to the harbour to take long exposure photos of well-known buildings in the middle of the night. All this is possible in Helsinki, without stress and in safety.</p>

<p>As you might know from my previous articles, in Helsinki you are never far away from nature, too. In my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/outdoors-in-helsinki.html">Outdoor Guide to Helsinki</a> I have shown how easy it is to enjoy the outdoors in and around the city, and a small Microadventure in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/microadventure-sipoonkorpi-national-park.html">Sipoonkorpi National Park</a> is just as easy as it is simply a short bus ride away. Going so easily and quickly to nature is a freedom which I really appreciate about Helsinki - if the hustle and bustle of the city gets too much it is not difficult to escape for a wee bit, so that you can <a href="https://www.myhelsinki.fi/en/work-and-study/helsinki-freedom/freedom-to-breathe">breathe in nature</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50729899462/in/dateposted/" title="Kota"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50729899462_342e41244f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Kota" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But you don’t have to take a bus to Sipoo or Nuuksio to get into nature, right in the city there’s plenty of parks, public beaches and small islands which are inviting for a walk, swim or picknick. Seakayaking or paddling is a fantastic way to explore the capital, and being on the water, paddling to a small island and going for a swim are for me the definition of being free.</p>

<p>It is not just nature, which is easily accessible in Helsinki. I loved visiting <a href="https://youtu.be/vFQ-iLa3m88">RopeCon</a> and meeting fellow geeks and nerds from all over Finland, and the Helsinki Pride Parade is a beautiful happening to attend and enjoy, <a href="https://www.myhelsinki.fi/en/work-and-study/helsinki-freedom/freedom-to-love">whatever your sexual orientation</a>. It’s one of the beauties of Helsinki and Finland, that you are free to be who you want to be: Gay, queer, non-binary, a role-playing geek or a hockey fan. Maybe that is why Finland was ranked as the <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2020/#read">happiest country in the World</a> in 2018 and 2019, and Helsinki is the happiest city in the world?!</p>

<p>It could be that that is the reason. And the city does a lot of things very well: Good public transportation, amazing Museums, libraries and public beaches and Cafés and Restaurants for any taste, from local over vegan to delicious Asian food, you can find anything to <a href="https://kathrindeter.com/category/restaurants/">suit your taste</a> in Helsinki when you get hungry. As the leading Nation in coffee consumption on the planet you can get plenty of amazing cups of coffee at the many lovely Cafés, too ☕️</p>

<p>There are many more good reasons why Helsinki is a great place to life. One more I can think of is that it’s very simple to start your own business in Finland, and Helsinki has a superb Start-up scene where you can connect with like-minded people and bounce off your ideas. Equally there are also many good companies to work for in different industries. Heck, you might even be able to keep your current job and simply move to Helsinki to live the good life in Finland! So in case you now are pondering coming to live (and hike!) in Finland, have a look at these five <a href="https://www.myhelsinki.fi/en/work-and-study/helsinki-freedom">interesting short movies</a> which highlight some of the aspects I mentioned in this article.</p>

<p>As for me, I am looking forward to my next visit to Helsinki, to meet friends, stroll along the coast, drink a tasty coffee and hear the waves lap against the shore! Maybe I will meet you there?</p>

While you’re reading this the first people are already out for a walk or run, and throughout the day humans across the globe will go at 7:00 pm of their local time out for a walk or run.</p>

<p><strong>So please join us!</strong> Walking or running is absolutely amazing for your mental health, gets your head free and your lungs full of fresh air (if you walk in the city, don’t forget to maybe wear a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/10/reuseable-face-masks.html">face mask</a> and practice social distancing).

    <updated>2020-11-18T19:17:37+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com//2020/11/the-digital-dilemma</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a problem when I go outdoors. The problem sits in my left trouser pocket, is a rectangle shape, a tad under 200 g light, and is called a phone. The problem is: It connects me to the world outside of this place where I am hiking and camping. And I wonder, if it is what I really want.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50617227087/in/dateposted/" title="At the Crossroads"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50617227087_25289982f0_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="At the Crossroads" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Chances are, you read this article on your phone. Hiking in Finland is a digital publication, and the chances are high, too, that you follow me on some of the Social Media networks that are out there: Instagram, Twitter, Youtube and Facebook.</p>

<p><em>“What’s the problem, Hendrik?”</em> you might ponder. Well, when I go outdoors, it is in 9 out of 10 cases for work. I’m in a really fortunate situation that I was able to make being outdoors my work. Ski-touring, backpacking, climbing or bikepacking - it’s my work. No complaints there, it’s awesome. I love being outdoors, and it is good for my mental health and general wellbeing.</p>

<p>Here’s the Dilemma, which I referred to earlier: That phone in my pocket. And the possibility to let you, my dear readers, Fans and friends, be part of my trip right in the instant.</p>

<p>The problem is also the possibilities that the phone gives me. <em>“I could share now how beautiful it is to sit at this fire!”</em> Or I could watch some Youtube videos. Read the News. See what others are up to on Twitter.</p>

<p>But do I do this for you, or do I do this for me? Do I need this <em>“instant gratification”</em> which I could get from positive reactions on Social Media?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50617115311/in/photostream/" title="Instagram Outdoors?!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50617115311_10ddfcaac2_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Instagram Outdoors?!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I don’t think I do it for me. Yes, I love to share my experiences from amazing places like the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/11/mullerthal-trail-route-1.html">Mullerthal Trail</a> in October, because I want to share with you how beautiful and wonderful this place is. But could it just wait? Would that allow me to experience and enjoy the place even more, if I wouldn’t need to feel like I <em>“Have to share”</em> this on Social Media right here and now?</p>

<p>I have done this, even on paid work trips, and it never has been an issue. It’s a wee bit more work (because I then need to remember to upload the stories and photos later on) but it’s possible. And it makes the trip a tad more enjoyable, because there’s one less thing to take care of.</p>

<p>But then, it’s not instant. I might make it look like I’m out all the time, which, you know by now, I am not. Not normally, definitely not this year. But it gives the impression, and while it might delight some people to see my latest photo of some amazing camp spot, it just as well might be making someone else more depressed that they don’t life this “amazing outdoor lifestyle”.</p>

<p>And would I miss the conversations, likes and comments? Yes. I like the chats I have with friends and Fans on Youtube, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook about trips, books, equipment, and always am happy to help and try to answer them all. Because I care.</p>

<p>But I try to get rid of putting any meaning to these numbers: How many likes, comments and RTs something gets. I do this for me, and you. And while at the same time I really appreciate, want and also need them (and especially the algorithms on all the Social Media platforms want them), I try to make a number not seem important to me. It is not, after all.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50616379803/in/photostream/" title="Flightmode Engaged"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50616379803_fed199361e_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Flightmode Engaged" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>When I am outdoors I try to really stay offline. It usually has a practical reason, too: Batteries in phones don’t last forever, and I only carry one power bank with me. And while I use the phone for navigating and photography, most of the time it is in Flightmode with all means of communication switched off. That makes the battery last the longest, and makes me less distracted. And when I navigate on steep, icy hills, being not distracted about some silly online stuff is good, because it means I won’t fall down 😆</p>

<p>All this is a long way of saying: In the future I plan not to post from the trail or mountains. When I feel lazy (as I don’t want to plan to do it later) or can not resist, I still might share some Instagram Stories from trips. When there’s an amazing Aurora Borealis, or an insane sunset, I might even post a photo right then &amp; there. But for the most part, what you will see from me on Social Media Networks, will be memories from times gone past. That doesn’t mean I’m outside all the time, even if I wish that could be the case, but it allows me to enjoy my time in the outdoors more. And that, Dear Reader, is probably the small nugget of wisdom I hope you take along from this article: To <strong>switch the phone off when you head outdoors, because it is good to be disconnected.</strong></p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>It is toasty warm, it is really light for what it does, and it lets all the air through so you want to wear something over the <a href="https://bit.ly/2UtFMRK">∞ Patagonia R1 Air</a> so the wind doesn’t blow away that lovely warm air layer around you! You can <a href="https://youtu.be/7vDo7rT7uv4">watch the Video</a> to get a good idea of this sweet piece of kit.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I bought the <a href="https://bit.ly/3pe27Ru">∞ Patagonia R1 Air Zip-Neck</a> in October and have been using it for around 10 days as I write this Review, for short day hikes, cycling and picking up the post 😁</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583047341/in/album-72157716816476902/" title="Patagucci"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583047341_e4fe099eb1_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Patagucci" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>This is a Midlayer garment made for cold weather and high exertion activities like winter backpacking, trailrunning in cold weather, mountaineering and ski touring. It works well for picking up the Post and Day hikes, too.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>I bought my Zip-Neck in Size S and it fits me perfectly (this is a slim fit garment, and I’m still 175 cm tall with a weight of 65 kg). It weighs 258 g.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50582306183/in/dateposted/" title="258 g in Size S"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50582306183_f932ba6fdf_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="258 g in Size S" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The features of this Zip-Neck, according to the Patagonia website:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hollow-core fabric with a unique zigzag texture</li>
  <li>A tiny Zippered Chest Pocket</li>
  <li>Off-shoulder seams</li>
  <li>A Half-zip for venting</li>
  <li>Soft Cuffs and Hem</li>
  <li>Fair Trade Certified™ sewn</li>
  <li>HeiQ Anti-Smell finish</li>
</ul>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50582306843/in/dateposted/" title="Zig. Zag."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50582306843_c6c887102c_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Zig. Zag." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>The fabric of the R1 Air is 100% recycled polyester, which is getting increasingly common nowadays and which is a positive development. Hollow fibres also have been around for a while (used for example in <a href="https://www.fiberpartner.com/products/fibers/hollow-polyester-fibers/">pillows and duvets</a>), and if my memory doesn’t betray me there are already a few outdoor apparel brands which have used hollow core fabrics in their garments.</p>

<p>Now that zig-zag pattern, which Patagonia says is <em>Unique</em>. I had to re-read my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/11/hoodylicious.html">Hoodylicious</a> article from 2012 as I was thinking that maybe the Silkbody Cellular Pilot Top had a similar fabric pattern, but it did not. My next step was to <a href="https://twitter.com/townsendoutdoor/status/1326852082708656128">consult Chris Townsend</a> as he has forty plus years more experience than me, and also he does not recall seeing such a pattern in outdoor garments before. So there we go, Patagonia indeed is the first to use this zig zag pattern <em>(and it’s warm &amp; good, as you’ll read in a moment)</em>!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583048346/in/dateposted/" title="Open Zipper"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583048346_1ee8d9adba_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Open Zipper" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>This is a Patagucci, äh, Patagonia piece. It’s a premium brand, and you pay a premium price, and so also the quality is premium. The R1 Air line of garments are Fair Trade Certified sewn in Sri Lanka, and the quality is indeed great, as you would expect.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50582304163/in/dateposted/" title="Made in Sri Lanka"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50582304163_89749533df_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Made in Sri Lanka" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>As it is made from 100% recycled polyester and is certified as bluesign® approved, with a HeiQ biocide finish (which is made from recycled silver salt) this is a garment which makes me smile - because it does well in terms of sustainability. <a href="http://www.kingwhale.com">Kingwhale in Taiwan</a> produces the hollow-core fabric, which is then shipped to Sri Lanka where is is made into the garments which we then wear outdoors. The Zip-Neck arrived with just a small hang tag and in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/plastic-wrapped-outdoor-gear.html">a small plastic bag</a>, so also on that front I am happy. If it is broken you can send it in to Patagonia to <a href="https://bit.ly/3kvDv3l">get it repaired</a>, and if you think it has served you enough over many cold winters, you could send it to Patagonia’s <a href="https://bit.ly/3eXq5f7">Worn Wear</a> initiative so that they can recycle it, or fix it and let it go on more adventures with someone else.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>Please treat this as an early review. This garment is available since late October 2020 - it was <a href="https://youtu.be/uYtkQtaUAq8">announced at the ISPO in January</a> and hence any “Reviews” you see online should be treated as “early impressions” after a wee bit of usage - unless you read this in May 2021 😉</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583043546/in/dateposted/" title="Thin"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583043546_13f43df6eb_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Thin" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As I wrote above already, I have used this Midlayer now 10 days for short day hikes, cycling and picking up the post. I haven’t been out backpacking with it, and I also haven’t used it for <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning</a> as right now it’s too warm for me to use such a garment for running. Speaking of temperatures - it’s right now November, with temps between 0°C and 8°C during the day, with frost at night. Already from the little usage I have and my 12+ years experience of winter backpacking I think this garment is made for significantly colder weather than this warm November, so I’m looking forward to taking it out ski touring and winter backpacking once winter arrives.</p>

<p>But let’s talk about warmth. Because that’s the first thing which comes to my mind when I think of this midlayer - it is ridiculously warm. The zig-zag pattern of the fabric allows for really big <em>“air gaps”</em> between the tufts of the hollow-core fabric, and these air gaps is what traps the air which your body heat warms up. In practice I believe these hollow core tufts are only there to keep the garment above your skin or baselayer, so that it can create this warm air field around you. It’s genius, really, and in combination with a wind jacket, hardshell or an insulation jacket it creates a double-sided, really warm layer of air around you. Because the zig-zag pattern is also on the outside, and so under a wind jacket or similar it creates another warm layer of air. I’m not getting tired of highlighting how amazing the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody</a> is as a windjacket, and it has surprised me to no small means how warm the R1 Air is in combination with that jacket in these cool temperatures. I can cycle with a T-Shirt, the r1 Air and the Alpine Start hoody, in November. Usually I’d wear a much warmer, heavier and thicker Midlayer + Insulation or Hardshell to not get cold!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583050181/in/dateposted/" title="Running away."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583050181_c593620c04_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Running away." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now on its own, or just over a T-Shirt or another baselayer, I will not use it. The thin fabric, so not the hollow-core tufts, but the cut-outs in-between them, well, they are nothing more than a mesh. You can see it in my Video above at the 4:21 mark really well, where I hold it into the sun and you can see right through it. In practice I have tried using it  on its own, but as I’m living at the coast we have always a wind blowing, and that wind goes right through the R1 Air and blows away your warm air field. Also when walking faster when in a windless forest I had the same effect - the air goes through it and takes the warmth away. Hence why I say this needs to be used with a jacket above it!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583169452/in/dateposted/" title="More close-ups."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583169452_52eafda0c6_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="More close-ups." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The tiny pocket on it, it’s good enough for a some <a href="https://trailbutter.eu">Trail Butter</a> pouches or a <a href="https://tidd.ly/3eQpKLn">∞ Clifbar</a>, you also can fit some batteries in it, but other than that it is small.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583168492/in/album-72157716816476902/" title="Trail Butter Sized Pocket"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583168492_e50038346c_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Trail Butter Sized Pocket" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The big zipper is great for venting, which might be necessary during ascents or when hiking for a longer time. I find it is easy for me to run “too hot” with the R1 Air in the warm November temperatures, and having the possibility to vent allows me to still use it. Plus, when slowing down, reaching the summit, or pottering around at camp, I simply zip it back up and am toasty warm. The collar on the Zip-Neck is really nice, it closes high and replaces a Buff for me.</p>

<p>Finally, the fabric is supposed to wick sweat quickly away from the skin making for a dry feeling. Now I haven’t undertaken any really sweat-inducing activities with it yet besides day hikes with a light pack, and on these I had a dry feeling. But if it was because of the moisture-wicking capabilities of the fabric or because I didn’t sweat that much, I don’t dare say. The fabric does have a none-smelly HeiQ finish, which is eliminating bad odours and keeps the garment fresh. That’s probably really useful (if it works) on longer hikes and when you’re wearing the R1 Air day-in, day-out for a few weeks.</p>

<p>By the way - the R1 Air is also available as a no-frills <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/patagonia-womens-r1-air-crew-fleece-jumper/?pid=10239">∞ Sweater</a> and a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/patagonia-r1-air-full-zip-hoody-fleece-jacket/?pid=10239">∞ Full-Zip Hoody</a>. All three styles are available as Womens and Mens versions, in different colours. But the best colour is purple 😎</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50582307068/in/album-72157716816476902/" title="Pocket Sized."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50582307068_efe9c1db7a_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Pocket Sized." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I have used this not enough to make some proper suggestions for improvement, but I have some things and features in mind which might make it better. First off are thumbloops. I’m a fan of these, and especially if gets cold it is nice to get more warmth to my hands with thumbloops. Then there’s the Pocket: I wonder if a larger pocket would make sense, or if maybe no pocket at all is better on the Zip-Neck (saving a tiny bit of weight)? Right now the Pocket is ok for some snacks or batteries, but even a Smartphone or a Notebook don’t fit in it. The question is if it needs to be any bigger - a map &amp; compass could go into the chest pocket of the jacket you wear over it, so what need is there for this pocket? It does well to keep snacks warm, though!</p>

<p>Finally, I wonder how durable the material will be. I fear it might be sensitive and only hold up for a few seasons, but it’s really too early to say this and in May 2021 I should know more about that.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583166172/in/dateposted/" title="Pocket."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583166172_0a5eb3ac78_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Pocket." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>It is too soon to call this warmest Midlayer I own just yet, but in the little time I have used it the R1 Air Zip-Neck really has made a very good impression on me. It is soooo warm (too warm for indoor use 😆), it is very comfortable on the skin, it is light, it is purple 💜 and it has an 1A+ Environmental track record. I can not wait to take it skitouring and backpacking this winter, and see how warm I will be in it. My early use at least suggests that I won’t feel cold!</p>

<p><strong>If you too don’t want to feel cold</strong>, head over to <a href="https://bit.ly/3pe27Ru">∞ Bergfreunde.eu</a> or <a href="https://tidd.ly/38O3AbN">∞ Bergzeit</a> to buy your own R1 Air when you’re in Europe. If you’re in North America, you’ll have to wait till february 2021 ro buy one from <a href="https://bit.ly/2UtFMRK">∞ Patagonia</a>. Remember, all styles are available as <a href="https://tidd.ly/3pwXUsy">∞ Women’s Versions</a> and <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/patagonia-womens-r1-air-crew-fleece-jumper/?pid=10239">∞ in different colours</a> in case you don’t like purple =)</p>

<h2 id="day-1-echternach---rosport---moersdorf">Day 1: Echternach - Rosport - Moersdorf</h2>

<p>Monday morning 7:00 o’clock, rain is hitting the windows of our <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/tower-hamelmaous">medieval fortification tower</a> in which were are sleeping while staying in Echternach, Luxembourg. Martin and me get up, happy about all this dry space and the warmth inside - we have experienced these kinds of mornings very differently over the past ten years, and while we were sceptical about <em>“not sleeping in a tent”</em> we really didn’t mind not having to pack up a wet shelter and gear this morning. Instead we sat in our warm &amp; dry kitchen, ate breakfast and then set off hiking <a href="https://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en/fiche/walking/stage-trail-mullerthal-trail-route-1">Route 1 of the Mullerthal Trail</a>. While bells of the church ring we start the hike from the centre of Echternach, the oldest town in Luxembourg.</p>

<p>We walk through the pretty Park just behind the Abbey and then along the river Sûre, which is also the Border to Germany on the other side. The light drizzle isn’t a problem, and after around 2 km we leave the river behind and climb up into the forest. Here the real Mullerthal Trail starts. Right away we see impressive rock formations tower above our right while we hike towards Rosport, the first village along the trail today. But till there it are still many kilometres, and the drizzle is becoming a more steady rain. It’s time for me to don my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/200-g-hardshell-montane-podium-pull-on-and-pants.html">Montane Podium Pull-on &amp; Pants</a>, a procedure which will be done several times per day on this hike, depending on the intensity of the rain.</p>

<p>Everything is wet. And green. A vibrant, wet green 🌳 Except the rocks - these tower in various shades of grey and brown along the trail, though truth be told - many are also covered in green moss. Once in a while traffic noise comes through the trees from the street far beneath us, but there’s other sounds closer by: The dripping of the rain on the beech leafs. Bird song accompanies us while we wander through the green jungle. Small streams gurgle through their beds when they run over rocks. And that soft, wet sound when you walk through mud with your <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/la-sportiva-crossover-2-dot-0-gtx.html">shoes</a>.</p>

<p>Never far away is also one of the Mullerthal Trailblazes, a red M on a white background. Overall signs really aren’t an issue on the trail - it’s a Premium Trail after all, which means there’s supposed to be a Trailblaze every 250 m. Also other signs are in no short abundance to be seen, from Signposts which tell you how far it is to the next place to trail markers for the dozens of other local trails which criss-cross the Mullerthal Trail. Sometimes we encountered signposts which had markings for seven different trails on them, from MTB Trails over border-crossing trails to local loop trails - there’s no shortage of outdoor possibilities in this corner of Luxembourg, be it hiking, trailrunning or Mountain Biking.</p>

<p>We continue in a good mood on this pretty trail, and even when it really starts to pour down we smile about the beauty which surrounds us. Mighty, green beech trees 🌳🌳🌳 keep most of the rain at bay and act like a giant umbrella. A soft brown blanket of old leafs makes for comfortable hiking. And small details make me smile.</p>

<p>We reach Rosport after a couple of hours and take a peak into the village if we spot an open Café, but no, there’s nothing to be seen. A large truck picks up milk from a local farmer as we hike out of Rosport, and we hope to get a short, dry moment in the Tudor Museum, but also it is closed. Ah well, happily I have some <a href="http://trailbutter.eu/">Trail Butter</a> with me, which I eat on the go.</p>

<p>We leave the forest behind for a moment and right at that time the wind starts to accelerate and hit us with its might - and the rain. We pass the Pilgrimage Chapel at Girsterklaus, and shortly ponder if we should try our luck and see if it is open, or simply continue. The rain and wind make the decision to search for some shelter easy, and much to our surprise and luck the Chapel is open - as is the toilet building in front of it! We wash our hands and disinfect them and look for the door to gain entry to the small Chapel.</p>

<p>Again we are in luck and find the Chapel open, and unoccupied. Better even, there’s a heating system blowing warm, dry air into the chapel, and we immediately sit down in front of it. We hang up rain jackets to dry a bit, snack some nuts, drink water. I wander around the Chapel, admiring the beautiful wooden carvings - some which are almost 500 years old.</p>

<p>As we set off a while later, the rain has stopped, and we also get back into the forest. A younger forest.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469409907/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Beech Forest, moist"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469409907_bfc8c0e979_6k.jpg" width="6000" height="4000" alt="Beech Forest, moist" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A forest next to open fields. In one of these we see a young deer, who is mighty unimpressed by us sneaking up on him to snap a photo.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469410092/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Wild Animals"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469410092_5f74849881_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Wild Animals" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The signs lead us on, and never astray.</p>

<p>Close to Moersdorf we pick some absolutely amazing tasty apples, plums and pears from the trees next to the trail. These <em>“Streuobstwiesen”</em>, or mixed orchard meadows, are often to be found along the trail, and in this Region of Luxembourg they use the fruits to make juice, cider and tasty food from them. And for us wet and hungry hikers, they are a very welcome snack!</p>

<p>It’s around 15:15 when we reach the signpost which says it’s 700 m to Moersdorf, the village where we planned to stop. <em>But it’s so early</em> we talk with Martin, <em>should we still continue to Mompach or Herborn? Then we have less to hike tomorrow.</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469620127/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Almost in Echternach!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469620127_34f4528c3e_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Almost in Echternach!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the end we decide to stick to the original plan, and hike down to Moersdorf. We locate the Busstop right away and don’t even have to wait long, before the Bus back to Echternach arrives. Public Transportation in Luxembourg is free, for everyone. As someone who does not own a car and who uses public transportation (or my bike!) all the time to get around, this is something I obviously absolutely LOVE. Free, punctual public transportation, across the whole country. Fantastic! It’s a 20 minute ride back to Echternach, and then we walk back to our medieval fortification tower for a warm shower and dry clothes. Obviously it also stopped to rain now…</p>

<h2 id="day-2-moersdorf---herborn---echternach">Day 2: Moersdorf - Herborn - Echternach</h2>

<p>Which is not something one could say of the next morning. The rain hammers against the windows of our tower, and after the breakfast we walk to the bus station to return to Moersdorf and continue our hike. Despite us both wearing our waterproofs we don’t look happy or in a high mood. But it doesn’t take long and we stand at the bus stop in Moersdorf, so all we can do is continue to hike back to the trail up in the forest. Which we do. And the forest doesn’t last long. In fact, a look on the map says we’ll be hiking out in the open for a considerable amount of time today. On a sunny, clear day one is supposed to have great views across the land from up here, but all we see are fields, windmills and the rain which is blowing into our faces.</p>

<p>Until the village of Mompach we pretty much are exposed to the wind and rain, so when we enter the forest after Mompach, and then see two Pavilions, we are very grateful for the possibility to get out of the elements for a moment. Martin brews us a coffee on his <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/primus-lite-gas-stove/?pid=10238">∞ Primus Lite+</a>, and after some more nuts, chocolate and a hot coffee we are in a better mood. Also, it seems we now will be hiking for a while in the forest, and not out in the open between fields.</p>

<p>It’s not a very photogenic weather, so we are fast. Less than an half an hour later we are seeing Herborn already, the next village which we will pass through.</p>

<p>Again there is no Café in sight, so we simply pass through the village in the rain. Happily, just before the forest, there is another open hut with a bench, where we have another short break out of the rain. It is now so wet that I decide to put my camera into my backpack and use my new <a href="https://amzn.to/35fK8B2">∞ GoPro HERO 9</a> to take photos and videos instead. It’s not something I would usually do, as I see my equipment as a tool that needs to survive these harsh conditions, but I also didn’t want to risk it to get even more soaked on the 2nd day of the trip.</p>

<p>Happily at some point the rain decided to make a short break, and we also were again in a forest. A pretty, vibrant green beech forest.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469275651/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="M"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469275651_e780818e5d_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="M" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>These last few kilometres of Route 1 were again enjoyable. We were in a good mood, here, in this 🌳 green forest. We made jokes. Laughed. Had another break, in another hut.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469438292/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Bench and Hut and Bin"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469438292_62bee33dc0_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Bench and Hut and Bin" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then we saw Echternach.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469281436/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Echternach"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469281436_268218a6af_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Echternach" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The forest road became a pretty path.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469439872/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Still down"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469439872_d4db696ccd_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Still down" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Slippery, yes. But better than an asphalt road between open fields.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469442542/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Jakobsweg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469442542_5531927d04_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Jakobsweg" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then we were back in Echternach, at the lake. Together with the rain.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50468586188/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Swan"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50468586188_a73ba9cfb9_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Swan" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Our conclusion of Route 1</strong> is that the first section from Echternach to Moersdorf via Rosport is a beautiful section (according to my Suunto Spartan Ultra GPS it were 20 km) through beautiful forests and along intriguing rock formations. The Chapel in Girsterklaus is pretty and does make for a good break spot, the apple, pear and plum trees which occasionally are next to the trail are in the autumn full of tasty fruits, and there’s some really scenic trail section.</p>

<p><em>Now for the section from Moersdorf to Herborn and back to Echternach…</em> I would not hike it if you’re not a completionist who is hunting for the title of <em>“I hiked the complete Mullerthal Trail”</em>. Maybe in sunny and warm weather the asphalt &amp; forest roads next to fields are enjoyable, but in the rain they were not. Martin and I both agreed that it would have made more sense to completely skip the 2nd part of Route 1 and hike on Route 2, which is the absolute highlight route of the Mullerthal Route with an amazing scenery spot every kilometre.</p>

<p>We were lucky that there were huts on the second day in which we could get a small break from the rain and wind, but this section was such a stark contrast to the beautiful forest part on Day 1 that we felt a bit let down. But then we had another four amazing hiking days on the Mullerthal Trail, so don’t worry 😁! Trip Reports from Route 2 and 3 will follow in short order.</p>

<h2 id="practicalities---where-to-stay-what-to-eat-and-how-to-get-around">Practicalities - Where to Stay, What to Eat and How to get Around</h2>

<p>We stayed at the start and the end of our trip in Echternach, which is a small town - the oldest in Luxembourg - which we really liked. We stayed the first three nights in the <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/tower-hamelmaous">medieval fortification tower Hämelmaous</a> which really was a beautiful experience. There’s a cozy kitchen at the ground floor, and then there’s four more floors in this round tower. It easily should sleep a family of four or more, and it’s also really close to the centre and the bus stop. At the end of our trip we slept in a <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/sleeping-like-diogenes">Wooden Barrel</a> on the Campground, which was a really cozy experience as well. I slept like a stone in my barrel, which is good for one to two persons and possibly a small child or two. The camping place is a wee bit outta town - some five to ten minutes of walking to the centre, but really close to the trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50587601737/in/dateposted/" title="Medieval fortification tower Hämelmaous"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50587601737_e6b4da72ff_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1535" alt="Medieval fortification tower Hämelmaous" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50586746458/in/dateposted/" title="Sleeping Barrel Echternach Camping"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50586746458_1587c47557_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Sleeping Barrel Echternach Camping" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We ate every evening in the <a href="https://aaleechternoach.lu/">Restaurant Aal Eechternoach</a>, which we picked because of the positive reviews it had on Google Maps - and as we went there every evening you probably understand that they also have good food =) They use a lot of local ingredients and also serve local beverages - the local apple juice was delicious, as were all their Vegan offerings. Martin ate the best Cordon Bleu of his life here, and it did look really very good indeed. There’s a small supermarket not far from the tower, and a few smaller ones on the main shopping street, where there’s also a nice wee bakery which had good baked goods.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50586736033/in/photostream/" title="Jackfruit Burger"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50586736033_c78cb38133_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Jackfruit Burger" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As I wrote above: <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/en/timetables-and-lines/bus/">Public bus transportation in Luxembourg</a> is free. Jump on a bus to get from one corner of the country to the other one (it’s a small country, so easy to do). The busses are plentiful and seem to stop even in the smallest villages, so hiking the Mullerthal Trail (or any other trail for that matter) in sections is easy to do.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Autumn is a busy time for us, as a lot of garden work needs to be done, we celebrate two birthdays, days get shorter and <em>Oh, there’s all the usual work, too!</em>. So a weekend get-away might seem like not the best idea, but indeed our small vacation in Rokua recharged our batteries and we had a lot of fun together as a family.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50396808772/in/album-72157716172733938/" title="Autumn colours in Rokua GeoPark 3"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50396808772_76300e2ed6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Autumn colours in Rokua GeoPark 3" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Days get shorter, mushrooms and berries are everywhere in the forests, and of course the trees start to be their prettiest 🍁🍂 Autumn is my favourite time of the year, and the possibility to share this special season with my family at the <a href="https://www.rokua.com">Rokua Health &amp; Spa Hotel</a> was very welcome, despite the busy times we usually have between the end of summer and the Holidays. So early on a Friday morning we packed our one <a href="https://tidd.ly/3o1B1wu">∞ Arc’teryx V110 Rolling Duffel</a> into a loaned car and started the drive North to Rokua. It is situated a wee bit from Oulu, and it was a beautiful, scenic drive along colourful trees to our destination.</p>

<p>We arrived early in the afternoon at the Hotel, checked in and then went to see both our room and the Kids Playroom. The Playroom was definitely a ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ facility, not only did they have toys for kids of all ages (and for both boys and girls equally!), but they also had a small Movie Theatre, a game room with XBoxes &amp; PlayStations, lots of board games and what our kids enjoyed the most, the little “gym”. Over the course of the weekend our two kids never got tired to go play here, and it definitely did set the bar really high for future hotel visits.</p>

<p>Since I learned to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/active-holidays-in-are-sweden.html">Downhill MTB in Åre</a> a few years ago I really love to ride bikes on Single Trails in the forest and hills. Mountain biking in Rokua is really enjoyable, as there’s a dedicated Team of locals who establish and maintain a superb trail network, and also in the <a href="https://www.rokuageopark.fi/en/experience">Rokua GeoPark</a> and the <a href="https://www.nationalparks.fi/rokuanp">Rokua National Park</a> you are allowed to drive on marked MTB Trails.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50396643361/in/album-72157716172733938/" title="MTBing in Rokua GeoPark 1"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50396643361_d663569daf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="MTBing in Rokua GeoPark 1" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Hannu rode a short 15 km loop with me, showing me a lot of beautiful, scenic spots along the way. From a Kota and a Laavu, to silent lakes which are surrounded by yellow birches, and lovely little trails through the GeoPark, I had a big smile on my face riding with Hannu, and really thankful that he went out with me. During the weekend he went on to coach a course at the Hotel about Mountain biking, and I am certain the participants came away with an equally big passion for riding on forest trails as him.</p>

<p>If you want to see more MTBing in Rokua, you should go watch my <a href="https://youtu.be/9UaMahrgToc">Video from Rokua</a> where there’s quite a bit of footage of riding - this was the first test of my new <a href="https://amzn.to/35fK8B2">∞ GoPro HERO 9</a> and I have to say that the image stabilization is pretty amazing!</p>

<p>On Saturday it was my turn to take care of the kids during the morning and afternoon, as M joined a Mushroom course. Having two people in the family who can identify mushrooms is better than one person, and M enjoyed the company and instructions at the course. Every participant got a small mushroom knife and a basket, and then they set off into the forest around the Hotel to collect. The Guide was around to help with identifying, but at the end the group went to the Kota next to the Hotel, where they went through all the mushrooms everyone had collected, and the Instructor explained what are the really delicious mushrooms, tasty mushrooms, edible mushrooms, and mushrooms you shouldn’t pick or eat 🍄 After that the instructor prepared a tasty dish from the really delicious mushrooms the whole group had collected!</p>

<p>While M was at the course the kids and me packed our <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/09/huckepacks-phoenix-lite-review.html">backpacks</a> and went for a short hike. I am very happy that our two kids like to go hiking - and they especially like it if there’s a 🔥 and marshmallows involved! We hiked a small loop, and used what would be the XC skiing loipe in winter for the way to the Jaakonjärvi Laavu. It’s an easy trail with some good views, but on the way back we decided to hike on and next to the abandoned rail track. This was a lot more fun and we saw more - more reindeer moss, more mushrooms, more berries and even a lovely orange-coloured swamp, as well as plenty of nice, little side trails.</p>

<p>At the Laavu I made a fire, we drunk hot juice and while the kids explored the surroundings I prepared them their sticks for grilling their marshmallows. It’s funny how such a small extra - molten sugar, basically! - can make from a simple hike a very memorable little trip.</p>

<p>The afternoon all four of us met up again, and we went together to the Spa and swimming pools. Our kids love to play in the water, and with a Sauna next door it is easy to go warm up in between swimming and so stay longer in the water!</p>

<p>Early on Sunday morning, after we had breakfast together, I sneaked out for another little MTB trip. This time I decided I wanted to ride to the southern-most Kota which could be reached on the cycling trails, at Rokuanjärvi. It was easy to follow the yellow dots of the MTB Trail from the Hotel till the Kota, where I met two young women which had camped out here. It’s a beautiful, scenic spot and I was happy they had a wee fire going and welcomed me inside, so I could drink a bit of water.</p>

<p>We chatted about cycling and hiking at Rokua National park and GeoPark, and then I said Farewell and cycled back to the Hotel - it was time to check-out and head home, after all. I filmed a lot with my <a href="https://amzn.to/35fK8B2">∞ new GoPro HERO 9</a>, and looking at the footage I am really amazed about this small camera, and can’t wait to take it skiing and packrafting! But that will be another story =)</p>

<p>While the kids enjoyed the last moments at the Playroom I packed up and got everything into the car, happy that we have an <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/06/ultralight-family-travel-with-eagle-creek.html">organized and lightweight packing approach</a> when we travel. That way packing is a breeze and soon we were on the way back south.</p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that we had a relaxing and adventurous family weekend at the <a href="https://www.rokua.com">Rokua Health &amp; Spa Hotel</a> and are ready for the remaining busy autumn! With its location right in the middle of the National Park and GeoPark - the only of its kind in Finland, by the way! - we could walk out of the Rokua Health &amp; Spa Hotel and be right in the middle of nature. Hiking, mushroom picking, Mountain biking, Trailrunning: It’s right in front of the door. As is a Playground, an Adventure Trail for kids, a lake in which you can go rowing, swimming and fishing, and in case the weather is not ideal for outdoor adventures: Stay indoors! With the modern Spa and swimming pool facilities, as well as the large gym, and not to forget the Kids Playroom you don’t have a reason to sit on your room when it rains outside. So if you too need a relaxing weekend away to recharge your body &amp; mind - head to Rokua!</p>

<p>Six years ago I hiked the Escapardenne Eislek Trail from Kautenbach in Luxembourg to La Roche-en-Ardenne in Belgium, and as I was fast back then (I was several years younger and carried less photo equipment 😁) I finished a day early and hence made a short trip to Berdorf and explored the local climbing crag and hiking trails. Since then I always wanted to go back to this corner of Luxembourg, and hike the <a href="https://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en">Mullerthal Trail</a>. Despite the on-going Pandemic I managed to fly to Germany, briefly visit my family and then travel by train and bus to Echternach in Luxembourg.</p>

<p>Together with my best friend Martin we were here to hike the complete Mullerthal Trail. There was just one problem: The weather forecast was wet. Wet as in <em>“It’s gonna rain the next nine days”</em> wet. Happily it didn’t end up raining all the time, but you’ll have to wait for that story in the detailed trip report later this month! For now I want to share some of my favourite impressions from this 112 km long trail with it’s three Routes:</p>

<p>You will be able to see some more photos on <a href="https://instagram.com/hendrikmorkel/">Instagram</a> this week before the article comes, so maybe give me a follow 😉 (and check out the Story Highlight Videos from the trail while you’re there!)! And if you can’t wait: The beech trees were still a vibrant green and just starting to put on their autumn 🍂 colours on as we left, so at least till the start of November you should be able to enjoy here the most beautiful autumn colours, in combination with the amazing rock formations and the very well marked trail!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you head outdoors in the city or have to travel, one thing is clear: You should be wearing a face mask. But instead of a disposable mask you should invest into a reuseable face mask. For yourself, and for the environment. Short on money? Then check out how I made a mask from an old T-Shirt, without sewing!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50403858361/in/dateposted/" title=", Maloja Face Mask Frontside"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50403858361_71f930ac97_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt=", Maloja Face Mask Frontside" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a href="https://www.christownsendoutdoors.com/2020/09/face-masks-reusable-not-disposable.html">As Chris wrote</a>: <em>“We all are, or at least should be, wearing Face Masks when out in Public.”</em> Right when this Pandemic kicked off Face Masks were hard to get by, and back in April I made from an old T-Shirt face masks for the whole family. This was super easy as the only thing one needed was a ruler, a pencil and scissors. I followed this <a href="https://youtu.be/K3mOrhxGiIU">simple Video</a> for those, and shortly later had four re-useable face masks which could be washed.</p>

<p>The DIY face mask from an old Patagonia T-Shirt has served me well over the past six months when I went grocery shopping. But in anticipation of an upcoming trip to Germany &amp; Luxembourg I decided I need to make a smarter impression on the Airport staff, and so I ordered for the whole family the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/maloja-mund-nasen-maske-printed-reusable/?pid=10239">∞ reuseable Face masks from Maloja</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50403155838/in/dateposted/" title="Maloja Face Mask, Front"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50403155838_98e11f2f99_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Maloja Face Mask, Front" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>It fits well over my beard, is easy to take off for eating or drinking, all without touching the front of the mask.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50403858236/in/dateposted/" title="Maloja Face Mask, off"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50403858236_eb76fbcf3f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Maloja Face Mask, off" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Maloja mask is Made in Europe, and has three layers: An inner and outer layer of a breathable functional fabric (Polyester), which is comfortable on the skin and allows me to breath normally. Between these two layers is a fleece insert which acts as a droplet filter. Finally, it has a Polygiene ViralOff finish, which <em>reduces viruses by 99% in two hours</em> [<a href="https://polygiene.com/viraloff/">Source</a>]. The mask has an adjustable nose bow and elastic straps for easily securing it around your head and neck. Also with my short beard it closes completely around the face and you can wear glasses and hearing aids with it, as the straps don’t interfere with these. The face mask is washable at 40 - 60 °C, although the effect of ViralOff slightly wears off after approx. 20 washes.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50403858026/in/dateposted/" title="Viral Off"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50403858026_7db3717f39_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Viral Off" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The best thing about the Maloja Face Masks is that they were made with people in mind who want to do sports. Mainly indoor sports, in a gym, where you can maybe not practice social distancing very well. I found them really breathable indeed, and like Chris in his article I will always now carry one when I go outdoors, as in cold wind or when it snows it also keep the face warm, while allowing me to breath comfortably!</p>

<p>The Maloja face masks come either in a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/maloja-face-mask-reusable/?pid=10239">∞ uni colour</a> which then cost around 10€ for one or with <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/maloja-mund-nasen-maske-printed-reusable/?pid=10239">∞ different prints</a> which then cost between 13 and 16€ depending on where you buy them. There’s also a <a href="https://tidd.ly/34e0CJp">∞ kids mask</a> available. I bought our masks at <a href="https://www.camu.fi/maloja-reusable-mask-printed/14448#4">Camu</a>, but also <a href="https://tidd.ly/3cKxr4C">∞ Bergzeit</a> and <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/maloja-mund-nasen-maske-printed-reusable/?pid=10239">∞ Bergfreunde</a> have them and send them fast &amp; cheap around the globe. With two of these I now feel ready to travel south!</p>

<p>Last week Friday we drove early in the morning North. North to Rokua. While in Vaasa only the maple trees have started to turn yellow, orange and red, up in Rokua my favourite season was already in full swing, and Birch trees stood in golden Dresses along the trails and lakes. It was beautiful.</p>

<p>We spent the weekend at the <a href="https://www.rokua.com/en">Rokua Health &amp; Spa Hotel</a>, which is located right in the middle of the Rokua GeoPark. From there we were able to go explore the surroundings easily.</p>

<p>We were both hiking and Mountain Biking, as there’s a superb MTB Trail Network in the area. I was lucky enough to have Hannu show me around on Friday afternoon, and M took part in a Mushroom Course on Saturday while I went hiking with the kids.</p>

<p>If we weren’t outside, we enjoyed the modern &amp; clean facilities at the Hotel. The kids loved the amazing Kid’s Playroom and were happy to play there by themselves. Happy kids, happy parents 😊</p>

<p>A ridiculously small pack size and a weight of around 2 kg make the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/Anfibio-packrafts/Anfibio-Rebel-2K::889.html?language=en">Anfibio Rebel 2K</a> an absolute dream to carry on backpacking trips, especially if you go off-trail over the hills. On the water the Rebel 2K shows that it’s not a kids toy: You can run rapids in it, with the optional skeg you paddle large water bodies more efficiently and faster, and the tube bags are amazing to store your gear while paddling, without having a backpack in front of your eyes! <a href="https://youtu.be/Xp3Pkxnl_po">Watch the Video</a> to see it in action:</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>The Rebel 2K arrived in March 2020 with me, and I have used it for paddling on lakes and rivers, paddling in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/bjorko-panike-trail.html">Kvarken Archipelago</a> and I paddled <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/impressions-from-lemmenjoki-and-ivalojoki.html">80 km on the Ivalojoki</a> in Lapland. It has seen a lot of use, and the season isn’t over yet!</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> The Anfibio Rebel 2K you see in this Review and Video is an early version (late 2019), and since then some things have been changed (e.g. the handle on the inside has been removed) and other details further improved.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The idea of a packraft was to allow you to ferry across large rivers and water bodies in remote areas. Nowadays packrafts are a sport on itself, and are used to run difficult, hard white water rapids, in Adventure Races, for fishing and also for trekking and relaxed paddling! Packrafts are inflated with an inflation bag and have one (rarely more) large air chamber. They are light weight - anything from 500 g to 5 kg or more.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50348476217/in/photostream/" title="Anfibio Rebel 2K"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50348476217_f790f2d211_b.jpg" width="1024" height="575" alt="Anfibio Rebel 2K" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>My Anfibio Rebel 2K with the optional tube bags weighs all in 2430 gram. Included in that weight is also the special Anfibio Rebel 2K Comfort Seat, which is 295 g, and the Anfibio DeckPack with 225 g. Not included, but useful to take along on large lake crossings, is the Anfibio Skeg, which is 85 g light. And obviously you also need the inflation bag, which is 108 g. You also need a paddle, PFD and a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/petzl-meteor-helmet-climbing-helmet/?pid=10239">∞ Helmet</a> if you want to paddle rapids.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The features, according to the Packrafting Store:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spacious, 37 cm wide inner with great foot space</li>
  <li>J-shaped Spraydeck which can be rolled to the side, making it an open boat</li>
  <li>Optional TubeBags for transport of your gear inside of the packraft</li>
  <li>Fin Mount for the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Accessories/Anfibio-Skeg::691.html">optional Skeg</a></li>
  <li>Included Comfort Seat</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Designing such a playful, versatile and lightweight yet durable packraft is an innovation, yes. You have to be more careful on low water, but with normal care and the intended use this packraft should last you long!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50352518397/in/dateposted/" title="Salamander"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50352518397_a2a08fe110_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Salamander" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The Packraft is Made in China, and this helps with it’s quality. Not many Western countries have access to the skilled labour force, the materials or tools necessary to produce such high quality packrafts which still do not cost a fortune. I found the quality, looking at the complete package, to be great. As the Packrafting Store gives an extended 3 year Warranty on the Rebel 2K, I imagine they are also convinced that it is a quality product!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50352667302/in/dateposted/" title="Read Carefully"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50352667302_ea11dfc50e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Read Carefully" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>As the packraft is Made in China it means it has to be transported by sea to Europe or elsewhere, and also labour and environmental standards are still lower in China than in Europe. On the other hand, most other packraft manufacturers also use materials which are made in China. I didn’t find a mention about sustainability or similar on the Packrafting Store website, which is something which could be addressed. In use a packraft is a long-lasting item, and always can be repaired, so I am not sure if the topic of recyclability is needed.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <em>I found this <a href="https://www.transa.ch/marken/anfibio/">short information</a> (in German) about the materials, recyclability and fair pay. The Packrafting-Store.de also reached out to inform me that their packrafts, which are Made in China, are transported via a land route to Europe, and not via sea!</em></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I absolutely am in love with the light weight of my Anfibio Rebel 2K packraft setup. Together with the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Paddle/Classic-paddles/Anfibio-Wave::875.html?language=en">920 g light Anfibio Wave paddle</a>, the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Accessories/Anfibio-Buoy-Boy::950.html">Anfibio BuoyBoy Vest</a> and my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/petzl-sirocco-helmet-climbing-helmet/?pid=10239">∞ Petzl Helmet</a> I have a packrafting setup which weighs around 4,5 kg. However, more important for me is the compact pack size which fits easily into or on top of a <a href="https://bit.ly/3l5QkTA">∞ Hyperlite Mountain Gear SouthWest 3400 pack</a> or the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/09/huckepacks-phoenix-lite-review.html">HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite</a>. Having such a compact packraft setup, which also is able to run Class II or more rapids, is immensely useful for me as it allows me to go more off-the-beaten track and run more remote waters.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50137014122/in/album-72157715182503422/" title="Summit Selfie V2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50137014122_2de7abcf10_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit Selfie V2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I found the Rebel 2K to perform well in rapids up to Class II+ with a good amount of water. The raft is agile and it’s easy to get it to go where I want it to go, and it also breaks well through waves. It’s OK in turning into an eddy or easy surfing, and I never capsized in it - it’s a pretty wide boat, and then packrafts generally are difficult to capsize. I haven’t tried doing an Eskimo roll in it, as I don’t have thigh straps, but you could install those for getting even more control over the raft and doing rolls. I used my legs, pushing against the inner tubes, for control, which worked good. I think also beginners will feel confident in this packraft, when running their first white water (as confident one can feel when one is for the first time running white water!)</p>

<p>The Spraydeck is a bit of a weak point for me, though - the Velcro closure will at some point let some water through, and I can’t get the Chimney to close reasonably well around my chest which means it will slide down after a while of paddling. I maybe simply should sew on some shoulder straps to solve this issue 🤔 (<strong>Edit:</strong> <em>The Spraycdeck + Chimney has been improved in current models, and should be better than mine, which is a packraft from the first batch.</em>) I also had some water pool on the Spraydeck after especially big waves, but simply pushing my knees and the Chimney up got the water off the boat. If I don’t need the Spraydeck it’s stowed away in a minute, neatly rolled and strapped to the side, making it an open boat. This is ideal for only crossing water bodies.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50351661298/in/dateposted/" title="Anfibio Rebel 2K Open Spraydeck"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50351661298_2316213035_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Anfibio Rebel 2K Open Spraydeck" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Comfort seat which comes with the raft is good and comfortable, but the strap which you use to connect the seat to the raft ripped out of the seat after a day on the water - that should probably get a better, more durable seam in the future. In use I found this great, as that way I could take the seat easily out to inflate + deflate and use it in camp for sitting. Inflating the seat is hard work - the valve needs strong lungs to inflate, and deflating it is also not my favourite part of a trip, but practice makes perfect. Overall the cockpit of the raft is really generous - 37 cm width on the inside is plenty for me, and I can sit with legs completely stretched out in the boat. There’s a lot of space for my feet and legs, which allows me to move around to switch positions.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50137008647/in/album-72157715182503422/" title="Final Camp"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50137008647_fb866210fe_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Final Camp" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On calm lakes, the sea and slow-flowing rivers the Rebel 2K performed flawlessly, especially with the Fin mounted and the wind in the back. I was able to paddle 4 to 5 km an hour with it under such conditions, but even paddling into 10 m/s wind I paddled 2 km in an hour. I do feel it is best suited for paddling on rivers with a good flow - or then that’s what I prefer, as it’s less work with good speed 🤣</p>

<p>At the start of my Ivalojoki trip I got a <em>tiny</em> puncture into the main tube after I was sliding over gravel in some really low water sections (I should have simply got out and walk it, but I didn’t want to get wet feet 😬) and it drove me insane - I spent two evenings looking for an hour each for the hole, without success. On the third day on the water I by coincidence found it and was able to fix it, which gave me peace of mind. I also would recommend anyone who wants to buy a Rebel 2K to order a set of <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Repairs-stuff/Anfibio-LifePatch::804.html">LifePatches</a> with the raft, as strangely there’s some repair fabrics coming with the raft but nothing to attach them with. That tiny puncture wasn’t bad, I had to inflate the packraft every hour with two, three puffs to get it again fully inflated, but it still was something that made me feel uneasy when running the more demanding rapids - something which I could have avoided completely if I’d remember my Rule #1: <em>“Never slide with your packraft over gravel banks!”</em>. So, learn from my mistakes, and do it better!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50351661393/in/dateposted/" title="Anfibio Rebel 2K Bottom damage"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50351661393_bb41abdf16_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Anfibio Rebel 2K Bottom damage" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Finally, the optional Tube Bags. Well, <em>optional</em> only if you are not going to do long paddling trips with the raft, and as you’re reading this review chances are that is exactly what you have in mind. So take the Rebel 2K <strong>with TubeBags</strong>. It’s so much better than strapping the backpack with all your gear to the front of the boat, it limiting your view on the water and the possibility to transport your bike on it. I love the TubeBags. They are so easy to use, and 70 l of Volume per Tube Bag is ridiculously large. I could fit the complete content of my backpack in there, all the camera gear, and the backpack itself. It’s fantastic. You need to plan what you need throughout the day, as you can not open the TubeBags when the raft is inflated (doing that will break the TubeBags), so pack your stove, coffee and lunch into the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Accessories/Anfibio-DeckPack::808.html">DeckPack</a> and you’re good to paddle the whole day without going hungry or decaffeinated.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50137010432/in/dateposted/" title="Full Deck Pack"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50137010432_91b0434902_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Full Deck Pack" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>Durability versus lightness, it’s the Battle of Eternity. In one of the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/MRS-packrafts:::43_65.html">MRS Packrafts</a> I can slide over gravel all day long without much of a problem - but then it is almost double as heavy as the Rebel 2K, and also a lot bigger in pack size. And as my packrafting style is more of a <em>“Hiking in the hills and then paddling”</em> the Rebel 2K suits me much better, as it makes the hiking and backpacking part of the trip more enjoyable. Nevertheless, I wish the Rebel 2K could be a tad more durable, while still being just as light. I also would wish for a better Chimney on the spraydeck, or a way that it gets tighter on top and doesn’t slide down so easily. I know that this is a problem which only really slim people like me will have, but this is my review, and I can wish here for things that better suit me 😆</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>If you’re new to the world of packrafting and want the packraft to be an addition to your backpacking trips, or want to be able to paddle easy white water rapids, or cross lakes or the sea, then the Anfibio Rebel 2K is for you. This is one of the most versatile packrafts on the market, which combines a lot of great features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Light weight and compact pack size</li>
  <li>The forgiving and easy handling of the packraft in white water makes it ideal for beginners</li>
  <li>TubeBags are fantastic to transport gear on paddle trips</li>
  <li>With the optional fin you get faster on lakes and paddle more straight &amp; efficiently</li>
  <li>The fantastically low price of 827 €!</li>
  <li>Did I mention the compact size and light weight yet?</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all the Rebel 2K is for me the ultimate adventure packraft – the packraft I take when I will be hiking off-the-beaten track to get to scenic rivers, on which I then can paddle back into civilization. It is light on my backpack and great on the water - exactly what I expect from an adventure packraft!</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>The Accordion closure of the Rolltop closure is a HUCKEPACKS innovation and makes your roll-top backpack look clean, with easier and less noisy access to the inside.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>Hand-made in Germany, from the highest-quality and lightest materials available. The quality is absolutely topnotch, and I expect this pack to last me many years =)</p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>HUCKEPACKS produces in a small workshop in Cologne (you can <a href="https://youtu.be/7oWBgnSEBMY">see it in this interview</a>) where the materials are cut and sewn together to create their ultralight packs and accessories. During cutting attention is paid to minimize waste, and also otherwise they try to minimize waste during production. The packs being made from DCFW or DxG I am not certain about what their recyclability is, but the life-cycle of the backpacks is long with normal, good care.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>As always, this is the most important part of the whole article - get a cup of coffee ☕️ or tea 🍵 and then read on.</p>

<p>The HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite is the lighter brother of the <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/phoenix/">Phoenix DxG</a>, and the Lite is made from black Dyneema Composite Fabric Woven (what we called cuben back in the day) in different strengths. The material is waterproof, the pack isn’t however - because the seams aren’t taped. In reality I haven’t had any rain/ water get into the pack, and the material is durable and has survived bushwhacking and heavier loads without problem thus far.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50327464042/in/dateposted/" title="HUCKEPACKS"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50327464042_756c9af547_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="HUCKEPACKS" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>COM. FORT. ABLE.</strong> I really love how comfortable this pack carries. The four segments of the ZLite, which function as the backpanel on the ergonomically designed back of the pack, are really pleasant on my back. And if you’re not a fan of it you also could use a different mattress or none at all, if you for example use the Burrito Frame packing method. I do get a sweaty back, but I do get that pretty much with every backpack I use. With food for 5 days, a tripod and camera gear the pack was really comfortable to carry all day long.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50327462992/in/photostream/" title="Shoulder Strap &amp; Back Pad 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50327462992_e7e4e47633_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Shoulder Strap &amp; Back Pad 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I always have loved the shoulder straps Mateusz has on his backpacks, and these are no different. They are really well designed and with a good, ergonomic fit that carries also heavier loads in comfort, and most importantly: I can attach my <a href="https://bit.ly/3bKwoRH">∞ Peak Design Capture V3 Clip</a> on them, for easy access to my camera. The shoulder straps are made from a 3D Mesh and Copolymer foam, in different thicknesses which makes them soft &amp; flexible and they adapt well to you body, while at the same time transferring the weight really well, ensuring a comfortable carry.</p>

<p>The Side pockets are spacious, and I can grab my water bottle while hiking, which I really appreciate, and there’s also space for more stuff, like my tripod, a Kuksa and my chili nuts. The front mesh pocket is big enough to fit in a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/09/hyperlite-mountain-gear-dirigo-2.html">large shelter</a> or my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/200-g-hardshell-montane-podium-pull-on-and-pants.html">rain gear</a> in there without problems.</p>

<p>The Hipbelt Plus Lite which I have with the pack suits my style better - I’m not a fan of the simple 20 mm hipbelt strap it comes with, and feel the Hipbelt Plus Lite is a good alternative for me. It wraps around my narrow hips nicely, and transfers the weight really well. Also long days with 10 to 12 kg are not problem, which is often the weight I carry at the start of a trip with all my camera gear, food and water.</p>

<p>And then finally, the collar and Accordion closure of the Phoenix Lite. Some of you might remember the original <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/first-look-laufbursche-huckepack.html">Laufbursche Huckepacks backpack</a>, which already had a very innovative closure that ensured that no water can get inside the pack. With the Phoenix Mateus went for a classic Toploader design with a rolltop closure – but the rolltop closure has a twist - actually, more a fold =) The Accordion closure gives this pack a really clean appearance as it folds the material, which in other backpacks comes out at the sides, to the inside. I imagine this adds to the durability of the pack, but it definitely makes it easier to get things from the inside, as you don’t even have to open the small hook as you can grab past it inside. No noisy Velcro which keeps it together, but a clean, minimalistic and durable way to close the top. I love it.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>From a design perspective I understand why the Phoenix Lite’s main body is 40 l Volume and not more, but I have on the start of my trips often found that I’d wish the pack had 5 or 10 l more Volume. The simple reason is that in addition to the backpacking kit and food I also carry camera gear which can range in Volume anywhere between one and ten litres. Especially at the start of a trip, when there’s food for seven days along, it’s for me really hard to figure out how I get my camera stuff inside. This is a problem which likely not many will have, but I wish that somehow the pack would have a wee bit more Volume so I could fit my camera gear easier inside (I solve this problem usually by having the camera stuff in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/05/huckepacks-beipack.html">beiPACK</a>!).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50327283211/in/photostream/" title="Tripod on the right, beiPACK, Camera Gear and Phoenix Lite"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50327283211_08a9d35cf3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tripod on the right, beiPACK, Camera Gear and Phoenix Lite" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I also would like to lose the grommet in the bottom. I haven’t had any water come inside through it, but similarly I never had to drain the inside of my pack. But I see as a possibility for moisture/ water to get inside the pack when I set it down where it is wet.</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like the side compression go the complete length of the pack. Now it only compress the upper 2/3 of the pack, and not the bottom, and I’d wish that the side compression straps would be more like on the <a href="https://ula-equipment.9xrw.net/P3qZN">∞ ULA Ohm</a>, which has from all the backpacks I have used in the past 20+ years the best side compression system.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I love how clean the pack looks when packed - there’s nothing superfluous on there, just a functional, beautiful pack which carries extremely well. And while I find it sometimes hard to fit everything I need to have along on a trip (as you can see above) it is a spacious pack for week-long trips. One thing I really appreciate and like is that a full pack doesn’t ride above my shoulders. Usually the pack stops on the same line as my shoulders, which is from an ergonomics point-of-view for me really good. It also gives usually the impression that one is on a day trip, as the pack is so small 😆 All in all this is my go-to pack when I’m heading outdoors, and I’m looking forward to many more great trips with this durable, beautiful, comfortable and well-designed pack. Also, make sure to see my detailed <a href="https://youtu.be/3tV8alDSVMo">HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite Review Video</a> to see what I carry in the pack and all the details in action!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>#NukuYöUlkona</strong> is an event from Suomen Latu, which inspires people in Finland (and elsewhere =) to sleep a night outside! This year I took the kids and our new family tent along, and we spent a beautiful afternoon, night and morning outside in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Kvarken Archipelago!</p>

<p>Packing for three is 3 times as complicated as packing for one - but as long as three spoons, three Kuksas and one stove, as well as Marshmallows, are along, nothing can go wrong! Seriously though, I had to make a list to make sure we had everything along on our hiking and camping trip for the #NukuYöUlkona Challenge. I also made them carry some gear - the older one a bit more, but even the small one carried 2 l of fresh water, her book and sleeping buddy for the whole 3,5 km without complaints!</p>

<p>I decided to take my small kids to Kvarken, and camp with them at Långgrundet, which is the fire and campsite I explored earlier in the year when I was <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/bjorko-panike-trail.html">packrafting here</a>. The trip had everything to go well: A great weather forecast with not too fresh temperatures during the night, clear skies to see the stars (and some faint Northern Lights!), a really nice trail, a lot less bugs than a few weeks ago still, and tasty berries along a nice trail. My wife dropped us off at Svedjehamn and then the three of us set out on the trail.</p>

<p>Along the trail we tasted lingonberries and Seabuckthorn berries, which grow a lot here in the Archipelago. They are a bit sour, but super healthy, and I find them really tasty. The kids got in the middle some Marshmallows as a motivation to keep going, but thanks to our regular Sunday hikes they are happy and able to walk longer distances - and so this 3,5 km trip was done after just an hour of hiking. As we arrived at Långgrundet we went to look together for the best spot for our <a href="https://tidd.ly/34LniCV">∞ new family tent</a>, and together picked a really good spot. I told the kids what’s most important, and they did a great job with pitching the tent and checking if it’s a flat spot =)</p>

<p>The next thing was what the kids waited for the most: Dinner! While I myself have a vegan diet since two years now, the kids like to eat some meat now &amp; then, and they wished to take some Bratwurst with us so we could grill them over the fire! They loved the grilled sausages which they ate around the fire hungrily, while I prepared two <a href="https://tidd.ly/2X2n0CX">∞ LYO Food meals</a> for us. We took them and our three long-handled Titanium spoons to the jetty, where we sat down in the setting sun and enjoyed our second dinner above the water. And because I wanted to make sure that they’re warm at night, we topped things off with a hot chocolate with more Marshmallows after that! Their bellies full they definitely were happy, and after brushing their teeth (they were not a fan of my <a href="https://amzn.to/3fd2AgD">∞ DentTabs</a>😁) the two of them retired to the tent and were reading with their headlamps on.</p>

<p>Once they put their lights off I went to take some photos.</p>

<p>I stayed up till a wee bit past midnight, as there was a good chance to see the Northern Lights that night, but ultimately was pretty tired and so also went to brush my teeth, topped off my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/therm-a-rest-neoair-uberlight-sleeping-mat/?pid=10239">∞ Uberlite</a> with one more puff and then snuggled up in my <a href="https://katabaticgear.com/shop/chisos-sleeping-bag/">Katabatic Gear Chisos</a> quilt. The kids were already peacefully sleeping under their own quilts (one <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/as-tucas-sestrals-quilt.html">As Tucas Sestrals Quilt</a> and one <a href="https://www.vaude.com/en-INT/Equipment/Sleeping-Bags-Mats/Sleeping-Bags/4792/Alpstein-450-DWN">Vaude Alpstein 450 quilt</a>), and soon I too was sleeping - though there were a lot of Whopper Swans making noise around us, and also some sheep with bells were walking around.</p>

<p>The next morning the oldest one was up at 8 am, and together we got silently out of the tent while the little one continued to sleep in the middle. I started to prepare breakfast for us - instant chocolate porridge with strawberries and raspberries - and then picked the little one up when she woke up. Together we sat at one of the benches, eating all our porridge, enjoying the warm, sunny weather on this Sunday morning.</p>

<p>And then it was time to start to pack already and head back to Svedjehamn. I asked the kids if they’d like to pick some Seabuckthorn berries for us, which we could make into a cake at home, and much to my surprise they were up for it (they did get several Marshmallows as a reward, too 😃)! This was perfect, because while they were picking berries I was able to pack everything into our three backpacks - of which I had the biggest one, a <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=47cd1998-e608-4548-aa0f-3d33e964ad3a&amp;website_id=a037a589-aec6-4e81-920c-77b10ab91eff&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fhyperlitemountaingear.com%2Fcollections%2Fpacks%2Fproducts%2F3400-southwest">∞ Hyperlite Mountain gear SouthWest 3400</a>!</p>

<p>Soon after, we shouldered our much lighter packs, and started the enjoyable hike back.</p>

<p>An hour later our little adventure came to an end. Again we picked tasty lingonberries and Seabuckthorn berries along the way, passed the birdwatching tower and the picturesque red boat sheds, and gave mom a big hug when we met her at Svedjehamn!</p>

<p>It was a great little trip with my kids. They also enjoyed it a lot, and are already asking when we will go the next time! With autumn at our doorstep the best time to go hiking and backpacking just started, so I hope we get to explore some trails around Vaasa and camp out together soon again!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, practically I wasn’t alone in Lemmenjoki National Park, as there were about 17 Million Mosquitos, 3 Million Black (Horse) Flies, one Reindeer, one Hawk, one Eagle and dozens of tadpoles. But once I left the Gold Trail behind me, I was alone - and loved it!</p>

<p>You know what is the problem with Lapland? It’s so darn far away from Vaasa. To be precise, it’s a 4 hour train ride and an additional 12 hour car ride far away. That’s a lot of sitting on your buttocks, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oolaw/">Olli</a> and me were mighty happy to roll on the very full parking lot of Lemmenjoki at 23:00 o’clock on a Sunday night in July. Now Lemmenjoki is Finland’s largest National Park, with an area of 2860 km², but also pretty inaccessible if you don’t have a car - as there’s not really any public transportation going to the Park - <em>and</em> it is also a bit <em>“off-the-beaten-track”</em> so we were pretty surprised to find a full parking lot. But then it was July, the month where Finns traditionally take holidays, and there’s also this <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/04/planning-your-first-hike.html">Pandemic</a> going on so maybe it was obvious that Finns will flock to their National Parks?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50247531077/in/dateposted/" title="Sign at the Parking Lot"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50247531077_7078ba7797_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sign at the Parking Lot" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Anyway, after roughly 16 hours of sitting I put on my new <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/inov-8-mudclaw-g-260-trail-running-shoes/?pid=10239">∞ inov-8 Mudclaw G 260 shoes</a>, shouldered my heavy <a href="https://bit.ly/3l5QkTA">∞ Southwest pack</a> with food for nine days and all the packrafting gear, and then Olli and me hiked to the Muurhaislampi camp spot some 900 m away. The sun was still shining, there were a few Mosquitos accompanying us, and at the camp spot we also met some other hikers who were still up and pitching their shelters. Olli and me had an (non-alcoholic) beer to celebrate our arrival, and then it was off to sleep.</p>

<p>Well, I at least tried to sleep. A lonely Reindeer with a bell around its neck kept walking around the camp ground and the lake, the <em>“ding-dong, ding-dong”</em> of the bell keeping me well awake. I was up early thus, made my breakfast porridge and coffee and waited for Olli to appear. He’d accompany me for a few kilometres to the summit of Joenkielinen, before he would continue to Kevo Nature Reserve. A bit after 9:00 I started to hike, just to meet Olli an hour later at the Sotkajärvi Laavu, where he had breakfast and I another coffee (Olli isn’t one for a breakfast right after getting up!). The temperature was already warm - maybe around 21°C - by the time we started the climb up the fjell. I decided to leave my heavy pack down by the trail, and hid it a bit. Happily Finland is still a safe country where this is possible to do - I really enjoyed hiking up the mountain with nothing but my camera in hand and the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/05/huckepacks-beipack.html">HUCKEPACKS beiPACK</a> around my shoulder.</p>

<p>We summited 45 minutes later, a great speed for the 3 km and around 300 m of ascent, especially since it got warmer, and warmer. Up on the summit of Joenkielinen a stiff breeze was blowing which helped us cool down. Taking in the magnificent views we did: You could see till Norway in the North-West, the Muotkatunturi Wilderness Area in the North-East, and Hammastunturi in the East. Gentle, rolling hills in every direction, in between there were silver slices of water bodies on which the sun reflected, and of course forests 🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲. It was a great summit to view the surroundings, and a day later I’d be standing alone on an even higher summit. Olli and me said good-bye - we’d meet again at the weekend - and while he ran back to the Parking lot I hiked down to my backpack - which was still there!</p>

<p>The trail continued as before, on a beautiful esker ridge which became a forest. I reached Searitniva after a while, and used the boat ferry to get to the other side of the Lemmenjoki river. There was a canoe and a row boat on the shore, and several people sitting around the ring of fire. I checked out the day trip hut, and then took my shoes off and ate some of my chilli nuts in the sun. I tried to slow down, not hurry to much, but didn’t enjoy the loud talking from the other people, so soon shouldered my <a href="https://bit.ly/3l5QkTA">∞ SouthWest backpack</a> again and continued. The 5 km to Härkäkoski were not fun: Too much mosquitos and horseflies where buzzing around me, and while they couldn’t get me because of the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/sea-to-summit-nano-mosquito-headnet-mosquito-net/?pid=10239">∞ Sea to Summit Nano Mosquito Headnet</a> I was wearing, their buzzing sound wasn’t pleasant, and neither was the by now really hot weather. I also didn’t have a coffee and the lack of caffeine did the rest.</p>

<p>I arrived at Härkäkoski, where there’s a rental hut, a campground and another boat ferry. I filled up my BeFree water bottle, took the stove out and made myself a coffee, which made me feel a lot better. The next two kilometres to the Ravadasjärvi Hut felt amazing again, with a pretty trail, a lot less insects bothering me, and it also was less warm. I soon arrived at the Ravadasjärvi Hut, and it was 17 o’clock. A good time to stop hiking, but then I did want to go to Kultahamina.</p>

<p>I chilled in the sun, let my feet cool down in the water of the Lemmenjoki river, and then asked a dad with his two sons who were making dinner if they’d been to Kultahamina and if it is as pretty as here at Ravadasjärvi. <em>“Nope”</em> he said, this spot would be a lot nicer. I answered some of his questions, and then decided to call it a day and put my gear into one of the two open shelters and stay here. I did hike some 23 km after all, and this was a beautiful evening with the sun shining. I rolled out my quilt and mattress in the hut, and then went to sit outside to make dinner and a cup of tea. I got to chat with Maria, who was hiking on her own with her dog.</p>

<p>Later that evening Maria, her dog and me hiked to the Ravadaköngäs waterfalls, which were pretty in the evening light, and it also made for a good evening stroll. By 21 o’clock I was under my quilt in the bivy, the couple of mosquitos who found a way inside the hut trying to get to me, but without any success thanks to the mesh net. I slept a solid 10 hours till 7:00 the next morning, including a wee stroll in the middle of the night to photograph the sunrise which bathed Morgam-Viipus fjell in a beautiful light pink-orange glow.</p>

<p>I was the first one up that morning, and silently enjoyed my breakfast. I had a long day ahead of me - because I didn’t camp at Kultahamina an additional 7 km were on top of my guesstimated 25 km route for the day, so you won’t be surprised to read that I was on the trail before 9:00 o’clock. I passed Ravadaköngäs again, this time the sun shining on the waterfall, and I enjoyed seeing it in this light again. The trail to Kultahamina was gorgeous, and I enjoyed this section immensely. Beautiful soft forest trails, passing some tiny streams which provided me with fresh, cold water on this already warm day, were very welcome. The Morgamnive campsite, down by the Lemmenjoki river, looked really inviting and even better than where I slept the previous night, but this are things you can not know before.</p>

<p>I arrived at Kultahamina around 11:00 and was put off by the 15+ Quads with trailers which stood under tarps close to the jetty and the open wilderness hut. Up till the 1st of July it was legal to search for gold in the National Park with “engine-powered machine” but now you’re only allowed to use a spade and a gold wash pan. I had a look around Kultahamina and had a small porridge break at the campfire place. A bunch of people started to hike past me, and I saw that one of the boats had arrived at the jetty. There’s a useful motor boat shuttle service running from Njurkulahti to Ravadasköngäs and Kultahamina twice a day, and many people use this possibility to either go up or down the river - it’s around 20 km of hiking you skip that way.</p>

<p>I finished my porridge and coffee and started the next leg of my hike. My map suggested there’d be an old trail crossing the river over to the other side, but shortly after exploring it the result was that my brand-new <a href="https://tidd.ly/3kXJP4R">∞ inov-8 Mudclaw G 260</a> were no longer bright green, but muddy brown - and I still wasn’t on the other side, but now also had wet shoes and socks. Yay! So back to the jetty I went, inflated my <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/Anfibio-packrafts/Anfibio-Rebel-2K::889.html?language=en">packraft</a> and paddled in 3 minutes over to the other side.</p>

<p>Once I had the packraft stored away again, the hardest stretch of the whole trip started: Hiking up to the summit of Morgam-Viipus. Roughly 400 m of ascent over 2 km, it was steep - add in a temperature of 22°C degree and my Army of Mosquitos and Black-flies which accompanied me, and you can picture how happy I was when I left the forest behind me and was above the treeline, where a nice breeze blew at least the annoying mosquitos away! During that strenuous hike I also was pondering the question if mosquitos and black flies have a territory which they inhabit and which they do not leave, or if they are nomads and would accompany me till Sallivaara or Ivalo 🤔</p>

<p>At the summit I had another coffee and chilled in the sun. It was a pretty day, and a large stone circle kept the wind at bay. The views towards the West were superb, as was my planned route towards the South and Sallivaara - it looked like a long day was still ahead of me… I walked on the soft, mossy ground to Viibosoaivi, and then passed a beautiful camping spot by the two lakes between the summit of Viibosoaivi and Sállejohoaivi. Tadpoles were swimming between the stones at the shore, there was little wind, plenty of flat spots for my TrailStar and bivy, and there were no mosquitos! I really should have just camped there - something which I can write now in hindsight, and which you should do when you’re going backpacking in Lemmenjoki!</p>

<p>I continued to the summit of Sállejohoaivi, and had dinner with a view. It was 17 o’clock, I was hungry, and I knew I wouldn’t be any time soon at Sallivaara, so I might as well make my pack a bit lighter and eat up here. I had a tasty REAL Turmat Vegan meal, a cup of tea and a smile on my face about the beauty which surrounded me. The sun ☀️ still stood high in the sky and it was warm, something which I welcomed as it meant I could hike in my T-Shirt here above the treeline.</p>

<p>My planned route now took me down via some boulder fields, and then I crossed a reindeer fence and a small stream before climbing a boulder field back up towards Jänisvaarat. When I arrived there, past 19 o’clock, I realized I had to abandon my original plan of hiking all the summits on my route towards Sallivaara. I had wanted to summit Iso Jänispää, Pikku Jänispää, Jänispäät and Jänispään Etelälaki on my route towards my goal for the day, but it was late, I was getting tired after already over 20 km of hiking and I wanted to arrive not too late. So I switched to the Altimeter view on my <a href="https://www.suunto.com/fi-fi/Tuotteet/Urheilulaitteet-ulkoiluun/Suunto-Spartan-Ultra/Suunto-Spartan-Ultra-All-Black-Titanium/">Suunto Spartan Ultra</a> which helped me to stay on the same altitude - which meant I saved energy - while I skirted the Jänispää summits.</p>

<p>It was late - probably around 21:30 o’clock - when I stood on the summit of Jänispään Etelälaki. It felt the day went on forever by now, and I still had 5 km to go till Sallivaara. There were a few swamps which I had to cross, and as I now dropped down between the trees also my mosquitos friends were back around me, accompanying me on this final stretch. The hiking went through dense birch trees to swamps full of Labrador Tea to sparse pine forests, and of course shortly before reaching Sallivaara I had to cross a swamp and got wet feet. This seems to be Murphy’s Law for me - dry feet most of the day, but shortly before camp… they get wet. And muddy. Yay.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock I walk inside of one of the huts at Sallivaara. There’s plenty of open huts here, but I need a moment to find the Open Wilderness Hut which is for us backpackers and hikers. I hang my sweaty clothes up, light a wee fire - more to get rid of the mosquitos and dry my clothes than to make it warm inside. The thermometer outside says it’s still 18°C, and I grab my two water bottles and walk to the spring. I have to cross the whole area to get to the small water spring, and am upset that I didn’t take my camera with me. It’s the Golden Hour, and the Reindeer Herding site, the huts and especially the absolutely gorgeous swamp are bathed in a golden light, and it all looks fantastic. Just the mosquitos… probably feel this walking buffet is for them. My hands are the only exposed skin, but it’s insane how many mosquitos land on them and get smacked to death in seconds. I must have killed three dozen mosquitos just while filling the water bottles at the spring, and then make a small run to leave most of them behind. Back at my hut I am just tired. It were 33 km, 26 km off-trail over the fjells, and so I slip into my bivy, happy that the mosquitos again can not get to me, and soon fall asleep.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning I get up late - it’s 9:00 o’clock when I crawl out of my quilt. Minutes later the <a href="https://tidd.ly/34fQqle">∞ Windboiler</a> is emitting steam, and I pour the boiling water in my large Kupilka Kuksa for my coffee. After the coffee I make a LYO Food coconut porridge, and start packing up. But before hiking to the Repovesi bridge and starting the packrafting trip of the part, I want to explore Sallivaara. My first stop is the information hut, which has information booklets in four or five languages about this site. The stories are beautiful, and tell so much of how infrastructure developments up here in Lapland can significantly impact the lives of the local Sámi people. Also the stories about the wolves, which have killed reindeer - but never a human - are things I wish more people would know.</p>

<p>Next I hike up the hill. I felt like this wouldn’t be necessary as I was on much higher hills the previous day, and didn’t think that this wee summit has anything of interest to show. How wrong I was! I could see the magnificent swamp I saw the previous evening, many pretty forest islands in the swamp, lots of fine summits - and also the bridge I’d be hiking to! A bird of prey was calling, and some rain started to come down - just to stop a few minutes later. The views from the hill were great thus, and I was happy that I walked up. Back at the hut - it’s about one kilometre to the huts and the round-up fence - I shouldered my pack for the final 7 km of this trip.</p>

<p>These 7 km went through plenty of swamps, and all the mosquitos tried again and again and again to get a drop of blood from my hands. While the scenery was superb - I love hiking through swamps - the mosquitos and black flies, together with the warm weather, were really going on my nerves. It felt that if a breeze blew away a bunch of mosquitos while out in the open, 10 seconds later a new swarm was ready to annoy &amp; attack me. I was so happy when I reached the road - where still dozens of mosquitos were around - and had my packraft inflated &amp; packed, ready for the next leg of the trip.</p>

<p><strong>Lemmenjoki National Park</strong> was amazing. I loved hiking on the Gold Trail, checking out the great huts and campsites along the way, and am a bit sad that I didn’t explore the North-Western part more, and also didn’t have time to go further south and check out some of the Fire Watch-out Towers. There’s quite a few open Wilderness Huts in the park, but besides the Gold Trail not really any trails - which makes it ideal for off-trail adventures. Hiking above the treeline is easy and rewarding with great views and no mosquitos, and down by the Lemmenjoki river you can see &amp; learn about the gold rush history of the area.</p>

<p>The biggest down-side to Lemmenjoki is getting there. You can get with public transportation (for example via <a href="https://www.vr.fi/cs/vr/fi/etusivu">night train</a> till Rovaniemi + <a href="https://www.matkahuolto.fi">bus</a>) till Ivalo, but then you’ll need to invest around 90€ for the Taxi-ride to Njurkulahti - one-way. You always can try to split the costs for the Taxi ride with other hikers you might meet on the bus to Ivalo, or try to hitch a ride - here up North it can be really easy to get taken along. I was lucky that I was able to share a ride with Olli and that he dropped me off at the trailhead, but also that was a 12 hour ride from Jyväskylä (including some breaks!).</p>

<p>On the trail I encountered dozens of people, which surprised me as I didn’t expect so many people to come this far off-the-beaten track. But it seems there were many day hikers who used the motor boat shuttle up or down the river, so after the last pick-up around 19 or 20 o’clock in the evening only the backpackers are left, and they were few. I imagine in the off-season (beautiful autumn, starting soon!) you will encounter few people on the trail, and again no one off it. Make sure to have your navigation skills up-to-date, a map, compass and your favourite <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/383480947">∞ navigation app</a> along for off-trail adventures, and then get ready to explore Finland’s largest National Park!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have wanted an ultralight rain jacket and pants since ages - something which is compact, very light and which keeps me dry when it starts to pour down 💦. I’m happy to report that I finally got something which fulfils my expectations - the Montane Podium Pull-on &amp; Pants!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49956448727/in/dateposted/" title="Öjenskogen Impressions"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49956448727_07a0a75d0e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Öjenskogen Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the above Video you see everything which you need to know and I have to say about the <a href="https://www.montane.com/mens-c1/unisex-podium-pull-on-p911">Podium Pull-on Hoody</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.montane.com/search?query=Podium">Pants</a> from Montane - in the rain 🌧 ! These are Unisex rain garments made for trailrunning, but with a light or <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/under-2-kg-baseweight-sul-summer-backpacking.html">SUL backpack</a> on your shoulders they also work really well. Just don’t use it if you carry a 15 kg or more heavy pack!</p>

<p>If you squeeze them together in the included stuff sack then the pull-on in Size S weighs 103 g, and the pants is even under 100 g at a mere 98 g. The rain gear I have worn (and still wear on longer trips where more rain is expected) is closer to 1 kg in weight together, so this is a major update &amp; weight saving for summer trips where I can get away with such light kit.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49956161841/in/dateposted/" title="Öjenskogen Impressions"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49956161841_6fc623970f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Öjenskogen Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I also used the pants and Pull-on on my recent <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/impressions-from-lemmenjoki-and-ivalojoki.html">packrafting trip in Lapland</a> as a waterproof jacket + pants while paddling (as I don’t yet own an <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Kleidung/Anfibio-ZipSuit::703.html">ultralight drysuit</a>!), where they did a great job. On the first day I forgot to switch jackets and the sleeves of my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody</a> got really (soaking) wet, a problem I didn’t have at all with the Montane Podium Pull-on. So it’s also multi-use, which is great!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50136774041/in/dateposted/" title="Psyched after running the &quot;hardest&quot; rapid on the trip"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50136774041_89a6246871_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Psyched after running the &quot;hardest&quot; rapid on the trip" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>It obviously also works well as a rainwear kit when <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning</a>, the small pack size means it fits in your trailrunning pack without problems. So if you practice trailrunning at home to keep fit and want something to take along on long runs to keep dry in the rain, this will suit just fine!</p>

<p>The only downside I found with both the pants and Pull-on are that I run really hot under them. Now both garments are made from Montane’s <em>Aqua Pro Lite</em> fabric which has a breathability rating of 15.000 g/ m2/ 24 h MVTR but in practice I found that it can get sweaty and warm underneath them if you throw them over your normal (hiking) garments. My solutions to this (and as a Disclosure, I do run hot easily!) is to only wear boxer shorts and a T-Shirt underneath them and have the zipper on the Pull-On open as much as possible. That keeps the temperature underneath at a bearable level, especially since I used these in summer temperatures where it was between 15°C and 30°C air temperature. Maybe in spring and autumn when it is cooler and less humid, that it will be less warm under it.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s not the most durable piece of kit, so do not wear this if you have to bushwhack or carry a heavy 20 kg backpack. The intended purpose is firmly for trailrunning, Ultra runs and not for backpacking - though it is completely fine to use it with an ultralight backpack in my experience. The material is really thin, and very stretchy, and hasn’t suffered on my trips in the past four months, but then it also hasn’t rained that much here and hence I haven’t worn it so often.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50194571363/in/dateposted/" title="Montane Podium Pants &amp; Pull-on"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50194571363_18edc0e8e5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Montane Podium Pants &amp; Pull-on" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, if these looks like something for you and you also want to carry a real UL rain jacket and pack in your pack, which does a good job of keeping you dry in the rain, then you can pick up the <a href="https://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/mens-clothing-c1/mens-waterproof-shell-c51/waterproof-smocks-c202/podium-unisex-waterproof-pull-on-p13318">Montane Podium Pull-on</a> at <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/04/one-stop-shop-ultralight-outdoor-gear.html">Ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk</a>, at <a href="https://amzn.to/31sGVvY">∞ Amazon.co.uk</a>, where you also can get the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Pv3wTb">∞ Montane Podium pants</a>. Currently both together cost around 178 €, which is less than their combined weight 😁</p>

<h2 id="awesome-maps">Awesome Maps!</h2>

<p>I have written about maps before (a loooong time ago <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/06/waterproof-hiking-maps.html">here</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/04/planning-a-trip-in-the-lake-district.html">here</a>). I ❤️ Maps. I love looking at them, planning hikes with them, love reliving past trips with them, just folding them back into the original way, that I don’t love that much (I’m not so good at that). A map you don’t need to fold at all are the maps from <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">∞ Awesome Maps</a> as you should frame them and hang them from your wall to look at. Like my <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/collections/canvas-world-maps/products/mountain-bike-mtb-trails-map-canvas?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">∞ Mountain biking World Map</a>, which I put up in my man cave. I started to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/active-holidays-in-are-sweden.html">Downhill MTB in Åre</a> a few years ago and absolutely love the sport, and I found this Awesome Map the prettiest - I love the style, colours and graphics.</p>

<p>But Awesome Maps not only makes this Map - they make (in Germany!) <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/pages/our-maps?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">∞ a dozen of inspiring outdoor maps</a>. And you don’t need to get them as a Canvas map either (though I highly recommend them!), the paper maps are just as pretty, more affordable and can also be easily hanged from the wall - either with the <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/products/wooden-oak-poster-hangers?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">∞ handmade Oak hanging frame</a>, some Blue Tac or you get it framed at your local framing business! The paper maps are made from the good stuff, too: 250 gsm art paper which is acid free and silk coated, and you even can write on them with an whiteboard marker! That’s perfect if you wanna put a check ✅ behind e.g. the trails you have hiked already!</p>

<h2 id="diy-frame-for-the-canvas-map">DIY Frame for the Canvas Map</h2>

<p>So that’s the canvas map Awesome Maps sent me, together with the <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/products/custom-made-diy-canvas-wood-frame-kit?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">∞ DIY Wood Canvas Frame</a>. I wanted the canvas map as it is larger and fits better into my man cave, and I also can hang it easily from the shelves in my man cave, as you hopefully agree 😊 And even if you don’t agree, hanging the canvas map from the shelves means I can hide the things behind it easily!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49742175336/in/dateposted/" title="Assembled the frame myself, which was a nice DIY Project"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49742175336_671f6a922f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Assembled the frame myself, which was a nice DIY Project" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Assembling the DIY Frame was easy: All I needed was a hammer and a canvas stapler, both tools which I owned already. It was a easy 20 minutes task to assemble the frame and staple the canvas to it, and then it was just a question to bring the large map from the living room to the cellar!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49742175451/in/dateposted/" title="Finished Awesome Map!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49742175451_b5b65ccd42_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Finished Awesome Map!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There I used two hooks from my IKEA shelf to hang the map, and <em>Voilá!</em> I have an awesome map to look at when I’m painting or packing or planning in my man cave!</p>

Definitely not for beginners, but for advanced backpackers a way to get even more enjoyment when hiking, while also sleeping comfortably &amp; warm at camp!

<h2 id="why-super-ultralight">WHY Super Ultralight?</h2>

<p>That questions is probably on a lot of readers minds. While I see more &amp; more lightweight backpacks and shelters when I am out <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/destinations/">backpacking in Finland</a>, there are still lots more people backpacking with heavy 80 l Volume backpacks, hiking on established trails &amp; sleeping in our Open Wilderness Huts. Which begs my question: Why so heavy? As you will see in this article, I own &amp; use UL gear since 10+ years, and yet things have to go broken. Which means ultralight equipment - backpacks, sleeping pads, shelters &amp; tents as well as garments, shoes and quilts - is durable and long-lasting, without being overbuilt.</p>

<p>While my base weight is usually somewhere around 3 to 5 kg, in the summer I do SUL trips as it’s very enjoyable to not carry the heavy camera and tripod, to leave the large backpack at home and simply to enjoy the small pack which carries everything I need for hiking on a trail on a warm summer day. People have a hard time believing that you can fit everything into a 24 l backpack, but hey - equipment materials have become lighter and can be compressed a lot more nowadays, so it’s pretty easy, as you can see in the accompanying video underneath. So for me going SUL in the summer is about enjoyment, being more connected to nature and the surrounding environment, while being able to cover longer distances without pain &amp; stress. It simply is fun to be out with a light pack, without sacrificing any comfort or safety. And yes, there’s also some gear-nerdery going on on such trips, and testing what is possible! <strong>You can view the complete list at the end of the article or <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/z1a081">here</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="carrying">Carrying</h2>

<p>Going SUL starts with the backpack for me. I want a comfortable, durable, and obviously really light backpack for short SUL Trips. HUCKEPACKS sent me their amazing <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/specials/packl-special/">PACKL Special</a> in Orange VX07 fabric, and I have been using this pack on short trips and day hikes since the spring. Now at 284 g and an extra 34 g for the foam CCF pad on the inside experienced hikers immediately will say <em>“There are lighter options!”</em> and they are right. For example the <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/packl-lite/">PACKL Lite</a>, also from HUCKEPACKS, is only 146 g <em>“heavy”</em> - that’s a whooping 138 g less, which in SUL Terms is A LOT. But I have the PACKL Special, and as my other equipment is really light, I can take this <em>slightly heavier</em> backpack 😃 And with it’s three extra pockets for organizing and the two mesh pockets for water bottles, this pack keeps my stuff organized and easy to access. It’s also really pretty, and easy to see which is good if you’re hunting in areas where there’s hunting going on. But yeah, I’m tempted to maybe pick up the PACKL Lite next summer, to go even a bit more light…</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49955656098/in/dateposted/" title="Öjenskogen Impressions"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49955656098_f20a8457a7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Öjenskogen Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sleeping">Sleeping</h2>

<p>MY SUL Sleep System is a combination of old and new gear. It is for me really amazing to see how some equipment has gotten progressively lighter over the last ten years, while other gear already was really light. The foundation of my comfortable &amp; warm sleep system is the <a href="https://tidd.ly/3jQB0JF">∞ Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Uberlite</a> (<a href="https://youtu.be/5oXFCJi0TII">Here’s my Review</a>), an amazingly warm &amp; comfortable inflatable sleeping pad which weighs a mere 232 g in the Regular length. That is 120 g lighter than my previous summer UL mattress, the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite.html">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Xlite</a> (which I still own and use regularly). A CCF pad or two could lighter, but honestly - this mattress is so compact in pack size, is so warm, comfortable and easy to use, that I don’t see a reason to use any other mattress.</p>

<p>My Medium-Length and Standard Width <a href="https://zpacks.com/products/30f-classic-sleeping-bag">ZPACKS Classic Sleeping Bag</a> is 340 g light, and this quilt is 10-ish years old. It’s a quilt I use on warm summer trips where I know the night temperatures will not go below 5°C (preferably a bit higher, though) and I absolutely LOVE ❤️ the amazing pack size of this quilt. It can be compressed to the size of a small loaf of bread with the cuben stuff-compression bag (18 g), something I can not do with my similarly great <a href="https://katabaticgear.com/shop/chisos-sleeping-bag/">Katabatic Gear Chisos 40°F quilt</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, so keep the Mosquitos away and stay protected from dew and rain splatters, I use the <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/millaris-bivy-sack/">As Tucas Millaris Bivy</a>. It’s 180 g light including the stuff sack, and is really spacious and also fits my winter sleeping bags. It works best against Mosquitos with two pegs to stake out the front, and then you can create with the elastic string a spacious interior space to sleep in, Mosquito-free. I used this sleep system also on my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/impressions-from-lemmenjoki-and-ivalojoki.html">recent trip in Lapland</a>, where it did a great job.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50137012222/in/dateposted/" title="Bed"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50137012222_214854e72b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bed" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="shelter">Shelter</h2>

<p>In addition to the aforementioned Bivy I also carry a tarp on my SUL Trips. You simply never can know when it starts to rain, or when the wind starts to blow so much that you want more protection. Hence a tarp. This <a href="https://www.gossamergear.com/collections/shelters-sleeping-pads/products/twinn-tarp">Gossamer Gear Tarp</a> isn’t made anymore, as I have a SUL Cuben version which weighs a mere 167 g incl. the straps. I also own &amp; can recommend the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=47cd1998-e608-4548-aa0f-3d33e964ad3a&amp;website_id=a037a589-aec6-4e81-920c-77b10ab91eff&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hyperlitemountaingear.com%2Fcollections%2Fultralight-backpacking-shelters-tents%2Fproducts%2Fflat-tarp">∞ Hyperlite Mountain Gear Flat Tarp</a> but it’s a bit heavier with all the straps. I still love tarps and especially with a bivy it’s a great setup, also in bad, rainy and windy weather. This tarp is really spacious, and pretty easy to pitch thanks to the Catenary curves - that way it’s simple to get a good, tight pitch.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50165394418/in/dateposted/" title="SUL Setup Summer 2020"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50165394418_6e73f70bca_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="SUL Setup Summer 2020" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="kitchen">Kitchen</h2>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/the-2nd-renaissance-of-esbit.html">Back in 2013 I wrote about Esbit</a> and the Solid Fuel Cook System from LiteTrail is still what I use today on SUL trips in the summer. It’s still amazingly compact, easy to use, efficient and at 90 g for the stove, ground + windscreen, pot with lid and the stuff sack hard to beat. I also have a tiny 8 g knife in the pot, my foldable Esbit Spoon - though in a pinch you also could simply use a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/lifeventure-titanium-long-handled-spoon/?pid=10239">∞long-handled spoon</a> instead - and the Esbit fuel tablets.</p>

<p>For water filtering and transport I have an old <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/salomon-soft-flask-std-42-water-bottle/?pid=10239">∞ 500 ml Flask</a> and a <a href="https://youtu.be/CneJY3F6zuY">Katadyn BeFree</a> - though I have heard a lot of good about the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/salomon-soft-flask-xa-filter-water-bottle/?pid=10239">∞ Salomon Soft Flask XA Filter</a> which is a bit lighter, but has a smaller volume. Nevertheless, I’d be curious to try the Salomon filter at some point - sadly a Waterfilter is something which one nowadays also should use in Finland, especially in areas where there’s a lot of other backpackers and hikers.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50166216747/in/dateposted/" title="SUL Esbit Kitchen"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50166216747_c150b7bb0f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="SUL Esbit Kitchen" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="hygiene">Hygiene</h2>

<p>My hygiene stuff is properly light - everything together a scant 37 g. I was lucky enough to find a foldable toothbrush years ago and I should have bought a few to stash away for the future. I also bring tooth silk and a tooth pick along because clean teeth are a bliss. I am using <a href="https://amzn.to/3fd2AgD">∞ Dent Tabs</a> since many years - they’re easy to pack and use, really light and leave less trash than a tube of tooth paste. I tried dehydrating my own Dent Tabs, but that wasn’t successful so the ones from DentTabs they are! For soap and cleaning I use nothing else than <a href="https://amzn.to/313znzB">∞ Dr. Bronners Peppermint</a>, I also have a few painkillers along, and a <a href="https://amzn.to/2BIt1xd">∞ Lipbalm from ClimbOn</a>. The Lipbalm also works really well for small scratches, wounds and blisters, so is proper Multiuse. It’s also made from 100% natural materials, which is always a plus in my book. All that hygiene stuff goes into a 10 year old ZPacks Cuben fibre bag, which still holds up really well. And yes, toilet paper is missing in the list and is needed, but won’t slow me down 😉</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50168619983/in/dateposted/" title="SUL Hygiene kit"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50168619983_1b5e51d53f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="SUL Hygiene kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="appareal">Appareal</h2>

<p>Lets start with the last bits of civilization: My wallet, keys, Suunto watch and phone. I bought a nice <a href="https://www.treadlitegear.co.uk/tread-lite-gear-zip-coin-card-case-wallet-from-83g-336-p.asp">wallet from Treadlite Gear</a> in which I have some Credit Cards and cash. My keys I usually leave at home/ car/ hotel depending on the trip, so these are not carried. On SUL trips I don’t take a camera as my Full Format <a href="https://amzn.to/2X9sE6d">∞Sony A7 III</a> with the <a href="https://amzn.to/3jQ8x6P">∞ GMaster 24-70 mm f/ 2.8 lens</a> is <strong>REALLY</strong> heavy, and the camera of my iPhone 7 is still plenty good for snaps in good weather. I am tempted to take my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/sony-rx100-iv-field-report.html">Sony RX 100 IV</a> at times, but then that is an additional 291 g … I also use the iPhone together with the <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/383480947">∞ Hikepack App</a> for navigation, and I can get 4 days of use out of the phone if it is in Airplane mode and with Battery Savings on. In addition I have the <a href="https://amzn.to/2X8JaUb">∞ Suunto Spartan Ultra</a> on my wrist which I use for tracking and navigation.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50032347368/in/dateposted/" title="Selfie on the Mälsorleden"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50032347368_ee84847a0d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Selfie on the Mälsorleden" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Depending on the weather + bugs to be expected I either wear shorts or a long pants. I have been a Houdini Friend in the past, and still am buying and wearing their garments if they suit me well, so most things are from Houdini - even if there are lighter options available, but I have these, the company does well for both people and the environment, so there’s no reason for me to buy different things. So, my <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/en-eu/clothing/shorts/ms-daybreak-shorts-249874?color=249874106">Daybreak Shorts</a> come on if I don’t expect a lot of Mosquitos and a lot of sun, and if the bugs are out then I put on the <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/en-eu/clothing/pants/ms-motion-pants-245174?color=245174174">Motion Lite Pants</a>. Both have zippered pockets, are durable, comfortable, have great freedom of movement and I can wear them for days on end.</p>

<p>On top I usually have a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/houdini-activist-tee-t-shirt/?pid=10239">∞ Houdini Activist T-Shirt</a> as the material mix of Merino Wool and Lyocell is working really well for me, I can have this on for a week without a problem. You might see white sweat stains after that time, but it doesn’t smell bad and is still comfy to wear. Depending on the bugs/ wind/ sunshine I also might be wearing the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start windjacket</a>, which is still - 7 years later! - my favourite wind jacket. Underneath I usually wear <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/ortovox-120-comp-light-boxer-merino-base-layer/?pid=10239">∞ Ortovox Comp Light Boxers</a>, at 54 g and being without any seams these are after much testing the best boxer shorts I have found. Their wide elastic “belt” doesn’t push or anything bad, it’s simply a really well designed boxer shorts which is very comfortable, again with the benefits of Merino Wool. If I wear shoes and socks, then the latter usually are <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/darn-tough-unstandard-stripe-crew-lightweight-with-cushion-sports-socks/?pid=10239">∞ Darn Tough Socks</a> as these are simply really good - comfortable &amp; durable.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50057615823/in/dateposted/" title="LUNA Sandals OSO Flaco"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50057615823_f1e1f665f9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="LUNA Sandals OSO Flaco" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Footwear-wise I like to hike in the summer in my <a href="https://bit.ly/2BFopb7">∞ Luna Sandals OSO Flaco</a>, these are simply AMAZING sandals and as soon as it is warm enough in Finland I will pretty much wear them all the time. But if it looks like there’s going to be rain, cold weather, lots of swamps to cross or mountains to climb, then other shoes come on. On my last trip I tried the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/inov-8-mudclaw-g-260-trail-running-shoes/?pid=10239">∞ inov-8 Mudclaw G 260</a> which let me done a bit durability-wise, in wet weather I’m a huge fan of the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/la-sportiva-crossover-2-dot-0-gtx.html">La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX</a>, but I also use shoes from <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/brands/salomon/trail-running-shoes/?pid=10239">∞ Salomon</a>, <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/on-cloudventure-peak-trail-running-shoes-bf/?pid=10239">∞ On Running</a> and many other models from <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/brands/la-sportiva/trail-running-shoes-bf/for--men/?pid=10239">∞ La Sportiva</a>.</p>

<p>In my pack I have three extra garment pieces on SUL Trips: The <a href="https://www.phdesigns.co.uk/waferlite-down-jacket-k-series">PHD WaferLite Down Jacket</a> which is hands-down the lightest and best down insulation piece I own for summer trips. 132 g light with a full zipper, it’s just the right jacket for fresh summer evenings where a cold wind blows or you need to huddle down in the rain under the tarp. The second and third apparel pieces are the <a href="https://www.montane.co.uk/mens-c1/unisex-podium-pull-on-p911">Montan Podium Pull-On</a> and <a href="https://www.montane.co.uk/unisex-c314/unisex-podium-pants-p910">Podium pants</a>. I wanted an SUL rain pants + jacket since ages, and was happy when Montane asked if I’d like to try them. These are quite a treat to carry at a combined weight of 203 g, and in the rain showers and thunderstorms I used them they have performed just fine and as you’d expect: They keep you dry.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49956161841/in/dateposted/" title="Öjenskogen Impressions"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49956161841_6fc623970f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Öjenskogen Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As seen above, I also wear a cap and sunglasses. My eyes are sensitive to the sun, so a pair of protective shades like the <a href="https://tidd.ly/3094EBX">∞ Oakley Latch</a> are mandatory for me on summer trips. The <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/patagonia-boardshort-label-funfarer-cap-cap/?pid=10239">∞ Patagonia Boardshort Funfarer Cap</a> is comfortable and has a closed back, which I prefer in Mosquito season. And while it isn’t in my list, if I expect <strong>A LOT OF MOSQUITOS</strong> then the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/sea-to-summit-nano-mosquito-headnet-mosquito-net/?pid=10239">∞ Sea to Summit Nano Mosquito Headnet</a> comes along (11 g extra, and so worth it!).</p>

<h2 id="food">Food</h2>

<p>I have a 95% Vegan diet since two years now, and it’s amazing how easy it is to eat healthy and tasty vegan food when outdoors. There’s a host of companies which make amazing vegan backpacking meals, so for people without the time to make meals yourself these are a really good option. I’m a huge fan of the <a href="https://tentmeals.co.uk/collections/main-meals">Tentmeals</a> meals &amp; breakfasts (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">My Patreons get a 25% Discount!</a>), the <a href="https://www.firepotfood.com/collections/firepot-dehydrated-meals/vegan">Firepot Vegan meals</a> are absolutely delicious and also the Vegan options from <a href="https://tidd.ly/2X2n0CX">∞ LYO Food</a> are always something to look forward to after a day of hiking or packrafting. From back in the day when I also was eating meat, fish and poultry I can recommend meals from the aforementioned brands and also <a href="https://realoutdoorfood.com/products/">REAL Turmat</a>.</p>

<p>Snack-wise I mix Chili Nuts and Honey-Roasted Nuts together, this is my absolute “<strong>Feel-Good Food</strong>” which helps me to stay motivated when I have a long day or a steep climb up a mountain. Similiarly I use <a href="https://tidd.ly/2P6YYSG">∞ Clif Bar Shot Bloks</a> as these are easy to consume, tasty, and the ones with coffein allow me to skip the coffee breaks if the day calls for it. Speaking of coffee, I use <a href="https://www.naturata.de/bio-produkte/kaffee-kakao/espresso-kaffee-sticks-bohnenkaffee-instant-25g/">Naturata Espresso Sticks</a>  since this year, it’s easier to get than than Starbucks Via, in my opinion even tastier, and it’s also Fair Trade and Organic.</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>

<p>This article, <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/z1a081">list</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/sYMGl8INJMo">video</a> show that it is nowadays extremely easy to carry really little &amp; very light equipment on your backpacking trips while still being safe, comfortable, well-fed, dry in the rain and warm at night. 95% of people hiking on maintained trails don’t need much more than what is shown in the article - and even if they do (a map and compass is a good addition, as could be a powerbank and maybe some fresh clothes for camp) the added weight still will have them carry less than what the majority of people seem to carry outdoors in Finland. Which is not to say those carrying more are doing something wrong, as they are not, though I often encounter these people bent forward from their heavy backpacks, which they put down as soon as an opportunity arises.</p>

<p>That gives the appearance that with a heavy backpack the hiking part of a backpacking trip isn’t enjoyed a lot, and for me that is where I see most of nature and I get the most enjoyment. With a light pack I can walk straight and unencumbered, I am able to let my eyes take in the surroundings - be it the Black-throated loon on the lake, the Reindeer which is grazing a few meters besides me on the fjell, the Marmot which is alerting it’s family of my arrival or the beautiful wildflowers which grow along the trail. For me the hiking part is where I see most on my trips, which makes me feel happy, and hence it is for me a lot more enjoyable to hike with a SUL Pack in the summer! I hope you try some of the things in this article, and if you have questions, feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a>!</p>

<p>This trip was spontaneous. I posted online, looking for a ride to Lapland, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oolaw/">Olli</a> replied. Turns out, Olli and I got along really well, and I think this was just the first trip we went on together. Well, sort of together, as I went to Lemmenjoki National park, hiking south through it, to the Repojoki river, which would join the mighty Ivalojoki river a bit later, while Olli continued to the impressive Kevo National park and it’s amazing canyon. I have 190 gb of Video to go through and edit, so for the moment please enjoy these photos from the trip, where also the weather was really fantastic (though there were too many Mosquitos and Black Flies for my liking).</p>

<p>Lemmenjoki National Park was surprisingly busy. You only can get here with an own car, but the Parking Lots were full and there was a steady flow of people using the shuttle boats from Njurgulahti to Kultahamina and back. I spent 3 days here, and had a great time - even though I had to wear my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody-windproof-jacket/?pid=10239">Alpine Start Hoody</a> almost all the time because of the Mosquitos!</p>

<p>After crossing Lemmenjoki I inflated <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/Anfibio-packrafts/Anfibio-Rebel-2K::889.html?language=en">my packraft</a> at the Repojoki bridge we had passed three days earlier by car, and started to paddle. First I had some headwind and safety concerns (paddling on your own in big, wild rivers is not recommended) but after the first rapids, lots of sunshine and warm weather my mood turned and I was able to enjoy the packrafting for this and the following days.</p>

<p>Gear of the trip is by the way the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/sea-to-summit-nano-mosquito-headnet-mosquito-net/?pid=10239">Sea to Summit Nano Mosquito Headnet</a>. I was <strong>SOOOOOO Happy</strong> I had this along, as it meant together with <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/patagonia-live-simply-guitar-funfarer-cap-cap/?pid=10239">my cap</a> (and sometimes the hood of the Alpine Start Hoody) Mosquitos and Black Flies couldn’t get to me - and try they did! A detailed trip report will follow in August, together with a <a href="http://youtube.com/hendrikmorkel">Video</a> or two.
