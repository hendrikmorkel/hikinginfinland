<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>I really missed talking to you. Twelve months is a long time of radio-silence, and I have a lot to tell you. Like all the awesome trips I have been on this year, from <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/05/lyngen.html">Ski-touring in Lyngen</a> to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/autumn-backpacking-in-the-dolomites.html">backpacking in the Dolomites</a>, 2016 has been fantastic. I spent great moments <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-the-bregenzerwald.html">with my family in the mountains</a>, and am looking very much forward to winter backpacking and other adventures.</p>

<p>But lets get down to business and start talking about the holiday season and the awesome <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/advent-calendar-2016/">Hiking in Finland Advent Calendar</a>. I saw it was again very nicely filled with prizes worth over 5.000€, and what better way to celebrate an awesome #HiFAdventCalendar season than with a sweet ADZHiFASO package from some small companies!</p>

<p><a href="https://whoopieslings.com/">whoopieslings.com</a> make a complete Hammock and Tarp Suspension Systems, and as I decided to give hammocks another chance what would be better than having a smart suspension system for it? A set of 6” whoopie slings, a pair of 6’ tree huggers and a pair of toggles should make setting up my hammock a breeze!</p>

<p>Similar to hammocking I think it is time to step up my trailrunning again! A <a href="http://www.ks-ultralightgear.com/p/blog-page_13.html">VRV8 Pack</a> from KS ultralight gear would be ideal for that - the pack is super simple yet efficient and packs all I need for a day out running in the forests and hills. It carries my poles, soft flasks or water bottles, and 8 l of gear fit into the main compartment, all with restricting movement.</p>

<p>One thing I have learned which should always be along is a pair of rain mitts. The <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=37&amp;products_id=51">Mountain Laurel Design eVent Rain Mitts</a> are the lightest rain mitts on the market and rumour has it that if one carries a pair rain usually doesn’t bother one when outside, so they’re kind of a good charm, too!</p>

<p>Also a pair of <a href="https://goosefeetgear.com/products/1-down-socks">GooseFeet Gear Down Socks</a> have been on my list for a long time - not just because I get awfully could feet at camp in winter, but also because they pack so tiny &amp; light when I’m hiking throughout the day. Filled with 850 fill power DownTek down these socks keep me toasty on my winter adventures, which is especially great after a long day in boots!</p>

<p>And finally, a <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/32-oz-wide-bottle#92=20">32 oz Wide Mouth Bottle</a> from Hydro Flask would be swell - not just for plenty of coffee the whole day but also for keeping drinks cold in the heat. It is BPA-Free, Toxin-Free and comes with a Lifetime Warranty - so this would be the last bottle I’d ever ask for!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>also for freeriding and ski-touring lighter means better: A lighter ski, boot and backpack allows you to skin up in more comfort &amp; faster, while at the same time preserving energy for the ride down. <a href="https://www.mammut.ch/">Mammut</a> updated their <a href="https://www.mammut.ch/INT/en/B2C-Kategorie/Skiing-Boarding/Ride-Removable-Airbag-3-0/p/2610-01250-0001-1030">Ride Removable Airbag 3.0 Backpack</a> which got even lighter this year, with the Removable Airbag System 3.0 getting even more compact &amp; dependable while remaining just as removable and transferable to other compatible packs as before. The airbag system itself is just 690 g and with a carbon cartridge it tips the scales at barely over 1 kg. The 30l backpack on the other hand fits enough gear for a long day in the mountains, with a front pocket for avalanche safety equipment &amp; a padded google pocket, it carries skis or a snowboard and an integrated helmet carrier carries the helmet when skinning up, too. All in all it’s a might fine pack and Airbag System that helps to keep me safe during deep powder days where the avalanche risk is high! Now lets hope that this winter is going to be better than the last one!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>you know what I like (you probably do by now =)? Small companies which make innovative gear. <a href="http://www.paramo-clothing.de/">Páramo</a> is such a company, which not only designs &amp; makes great garments for outdoor activities, they also do good and foster ethical &amp; sustainable production. Take their <a href="">Enduro Jacket</a> for example, which is made from their directional Nikwax Analogy Waterproof fabric. It is Made in Colombia, is 100% PFC Free, at the end of its long life it can be recycled via the Páramo Recycling Scheme and the company helps to fund conservation projects across the globe. That’s a lot of good things a single jacket can do for people, planet and the one wearing it. Made for the mountains the Enduro can accompany one ski-touring and alpine climbing with its great freedom of movement, while the many pockets keep important kit close at hand. The large peak on the helmet-compatible hood keeps snow and rain at bay, and large arm vents help to stay cool when skinning up a mountain. And after a long season of use &amp; fun it can be made like new again by washing it with Nikwax products! Yeps, that are exactly the kind of things I like and wish there would be more from!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rutalocura.com/">Ruta Locura</a> is one of those small cottages which know their trade and their ultralight materials, in in their case that’s carbon fibre. Josh has been building since the mid-2000s carbon fibre and titanium goods for ultralight backpackers, campers, fishermen and hunters alike, and their <a href="http://www.rutalocura.com/trekking_poles.html">Yana Trekking Poles</a> are some of the most versatile poles on the market. Not just are they great to pitch Pyramid shelters and tarps at the end of the day, they also can be transformed into a tenkara rod when you want to add some trout to the Menu in the evening! The poles are also light, as you would expect, and so durable that a pair should last with some proper care and maintenance at least half a lite time!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Winter is also the time for wearing toasty warm down jackets. But down does not equal down, and hence we as consumers need to sometimes steer companies into the right direction. One company which doesn’t need steering but is leading in responsibly manufactured down is <a href="http://www.mountain-equipment.de">Mountain Equipment</a> with their <a href="http://www.thedowncodex.co.uk">Down Codex</a>. Since many years they offer customers the ability to 100% trace the down in their sleeping bags and jackets, which means one can have peace of mind in knowing that the down which keeps one warm was gathered with animal welfare in mind. So back to that toasty jacket I mentioned: With winters being warmer in the last few years a jacket like the <a href="http://www.mountain-equipment.de/arete-hooded-jacket">Men’s Arete Hooded Jacket</a> is ideal for the temperatures one encounters in our winters. The 320 g light jacket comes with two zippered pockets for cold hands &amp; camera batteries, and the hood ensures also ears and neck don’t need to freeze. Best of all: The water-resistant down doesn’t collapse when the snow turns to slush, and with some smart layering one could use this down jacket all year around!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blackrockgear.com">Black Rock Gear</a> hails from Seattle, Washington, that city which is known for Nirvana, Rain, Starbucks and the Space Needle, and it’s location between Puget Sound and the Cascade Mountain range makes it a great location for outdoor enthusiasts. It’s thus no surprise that Black Rock Gear makes some of the finest &amp; lightest <a href="https://www.blackrockgear.com/gear/">Down Hats</a> available for outdoor enthusiasts around the globe. Take The Original Beanie for example, which was an instant classic when it launched several years ago. Filled with 950 fill power goose down and sewn with ultralight ripstop nylon it’s so light, you sometimes only realize it’s on your head because your ears are toasty! Also the <a href="https://www.blackrockgear.com/product/the-brg-sport-pack/">BRG Sport Pack</a> is a light daypack made from durable materials which is excellent for those Urban adventures one goes on. It’s water-proof zippers keeps the inside dry, and the two internal Mesh “Catch All” Pockets help with organzing on the go. The pack can be fully opened for easy packing and access, and the padded shoulder straps make it comfortable to carry all day long!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Quilts are what we ultralight backpackers &amp; climbers love most. Not only are they way lighter than a sleeping bag, but the freedom of movement and ease of use are at least as important. <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/">Enlightened Equipment</a> makes some of the most innovative <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/quilts/">quilts</a> on the market, and almost all of their quilts are Made-to-Order exactly like one wants it. Extra down and a slim cut? No problem! Synthetic insulation and a wide foot box? Also no problem! Tim and his employees are able to fulfil almost every wish when it comes to quilts, and once you have slept under an Enlightened Equipment Quilt you won’t ever go back to a sleeping bag!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Winter, that’s ski-touring season for me. I love to skin up a lonely mountain with a good friend or two, enjoy a warm cup of tea at the summit before dropping in and enjoying fresh powder &amp; untouched slopes on the way back to the valley. On a trip like this a good-fitting and functional ski-touring backpack is mandatory, and the <a href="http://www.marmot.de/content/en/collection_36&amp;c=892">Backcountry 32 Pack</a> from <a href="http://www.marmot.de/">Marmot</a> ticks those boxes very well. When you need to Bootpack it carries the skis in a A-Frame or diagonally, a Shovel and Probe Pocket give fast access to the essential tools when needed and the ergonomically designed shoulder harness makes the pack comfortably to carry all day long. Add in that it is light and durably made and you have pack that you’re looking forward to to carry when you get early in the morning to climb up a mountain!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>December is the darkest month of the year, when the days get shorter and shorter until the winter solstice. That’s not ideal for being outdoors here up in the north, but that’s where <a href="http://www.suprabeam.com/">Suprabeam</a> comes in: With their <a href="http://www.suprabeam.com/uk/products/v3air">V3air Headlamp</a> and the <a href="http://www.suprabeam.com/uk/products/q3defend">Q3defend Torch</a> we bring light into the December darkness and can pursue our outdoor activities in the bright light of this headlamp and torch! The V3air is just 140 g but boost up to 250 Lumens, enough to shine up to 195 m far. The Q3defend Torch is even more powerful and also very versatile, and also waterproof! With these two lamps the darkness can come, because we’re ready for it!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.icebug.com/">ICEBUG</a> hails from Sweden and if they know one thing then it is how to have good grip on slippery surfaces like ice and snow when you’re out running. The <a href="http://int-shop.icebug.com/springa/40-49/dubbade/anima5-m-bugrip">Anima5 BUGrip</a> is a dream come true for us ultralight backpackers and trailrunners as one shoe tips the scales at 280 g in a Size 7.5! Add in plenty of durable Carbide Tips which will bite into the hardest snow &amp; ice to guarantee great grip as well as the weather shield membrane which is laminated to the backside of the upper textile and which prevents snow, cold air and slush to your feet when conditions are getting rough, and you have a shoe which is made for running in the North from October to April!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>remember that I told you a while ago that one never can have enough backpacks? With the <a href="http://www.vaude.com/en-NL/Products/Backpacks/Citus-24-LW-lava.html#">Citus 24 LW Backpack</a> from <a href="http://www.vaude.com/">VAUDE</a> that is certainly true, because a 500 g light pack that’s also very environmentally friendly is definitely worth having for day hikes and overnighters. It’s ventilated back and the ventilated shoulder straps &amp; hipbelt makes it ideal for hot environments - like hiking in Spain and Portugal. Two stretchy side pockets pack water &amp; snacks for easy access on the go, and the reflective details make one visible when hiking late at night back to the village. A durable pack that’s made from sustainable materials, resource-efficient manufacturing and fair production - a triple win thus!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Something Ultralight backpackers love more than cuben and carbon is titanium. Durable, light and pretty, that’s very understandable I’d say. And as the <a href="https://www.trekking-lite-store.com">Trekking-Lite-Shop.com</a> garners to the needs and wants of ultralight backpackers it is no surprise that they also carry a fine array of titanium goodies. Two of these which took my fancy are the <a href="https://www.trekking-lite-store.com/kueche/kocher/11096/toaks-ultralight-titanium-cook-system-cs02-mit-650-ml-topf">Toaks Ultralight Titanium Cook System CS02</a> and the <a href="https://www.trekking-lite-store.com/kueche/geschirr/11105/toaks-titan-tasse-375-ml-cup">Toaks Ti Cup</a>, because as fast it is to boil water with a gas stove so noisy is it, and heavy they are, too. Not so the  Toaks Ultralight Titanium Cook System CS02, which tips the scales at a light 166 g and boils water with denatured alcohol in a silent and fast manner. The Ti Cup is just the right size to enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning or a hot chocolate in the evening while the food is getting ready in the bigger pot. All in all a great setup which doesn’t weigh one down!</p>

<p><a title="Advent Calendar TLZ Toaks Prize" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31581257835/in/dateposted/"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/1/610/31581257835_1155a55dcb_b.jpg" alt="Advent Calendar TLZ Toaks Prize" width="1024" height="768" /></a></p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>I love to climb when I’m not hiking, and what does one need for climbing? Right, a rope! Happily the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/?pid=10239">Bergfreunde</a> have a wide variety of ropes, and what’s better than a rope for a dirtbag climber? Exactly, a great rope for a good price with something on top! The <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/edelrid-daku-100-bergfreunde-edition/?pid=10239">Edelrid Daku 10.0</a> Bergfreunde Edition Rope is such a rope - it’s not just affordable and high-quality, the 10.0 diameter is ideal for projecting and the included ropebag means it stays clean and is easy to transport! It’s just what I need for sports climbing and mixed &amp; ice climbs, so I hope to find one under the Christmas tree soon!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>when you go out with your partner or friends, as I was writing yesterday, having a stove along which allows you to cook &amp; boil water for both at the same time is a huge benefit. No one wants to wait after a winter day in the hills for a hot cup of tea, so a group stove system should be along to make the stay more pleasant. The <a href="http://www.eoe-europe.com/Produkte/Kocher/Palladium/palladium.html">Palladium Stove</a> is a powerful titanium gas stove which offers a solid place for large pans and pots - like those in the  <a href="http://www.eoe-europe.com/Produkte/Geschirr/Zirkon/zirkon.html">Zirkon Set</a>! With a 800 ml and a 1200 ml pot and two pans one can cook a feast outdoors - and thanks to the included sponge the clean-up isn’t a problem, either! Rounding out this lightweight set is the <a href="http://www.eoe-europe.com/Produkte/Zubehor/Bulbul/bulbul.html">Bulbul</a> windscreen, which ensures the Palladium stove can work as efficiently as possible. With this stove set along it’s easy &amp; fun to cook for your partner or a group, making any outdoor trip even more memorable!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>the best way to enjoy the outdoors is with your partner - because sitting back at home and reminiscing about great adventures together creates great bonds for life. And while sharing one backpack certainly is in the sense of ultralight backpacking, sometimes it is easier when everyone carries their own pack. <a href="http://www.partioaitta.fi/">Partioaitta</a> helps with finding the right pack for everyone, for example the <a href="http://www.partioaitta.fi/osprey-tempest-30">Osprey Tempest 30</a> for her or the <a href="http://www.partioaitta.fi/osprey-talon-33">Osprey Talon 33</a> for him. Both are comfortable to carry, have large front mesh pockets and stretchy side pockets, and pack all the gear one needs for day hikes. Add in that they are both lightweight and durable, and you have a companion for life - just like your backpacking partner!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>as I just returned from an amazing two weeks in Mexico you can imagine that I’m missing me some good Mexican food. A good thing is that <a href="https://www.trekneat.com/">Trek’n Eat</a> has a Quinoa Mexican Style which brings the flavours of Mexico along on my hikes in Europe, spicing up my winter adventures here in the north. And as I am always hungry and hate to wait for my food, the <a href="https://www.optimusstoves.com/de/de/274-8016163-optimus-crux-lite-solo-cook-system">Optimus Crux Lite Solo System</a> is an ideal companion for me, as it boils water and melts snow in minutes, which means I never need to wait too long for my meal! And what would be a meal without a cold bottle of water, especially on hot Mexican days? Right! The <a href="https://www.katadyn.com/de/de/14947-8019946-katadyn-beefree-water-filtration-system_eu">Katadyn BeFree</a> Water Filtration System is an all-in-one water bottle with water filter. The system is so easy and light that I even carry it along in Finland, where you generally can drink the clean water from any lake!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>what I like almost more than ultralight backpacking nowadays is photography. Capturing moments, be it shadows &amp; light in the the city or sunsets in the mountains, just gives me an immense fulfilment &amp; happiness. But carrying my gear around in a frameless backpack doesn’t, and as <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/?acc=97">Peak Design</a> announced their <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/product/bags/everyday-backpack/?acc=97">Everyday Backpack</a> I knew that this is the one pack to carry my photography gear, in town, the forests and mountains, on plane trips and strolls through the city. It allows me to not just carry my camera, but also my Drone and Mac as well as a few lenses and more. Add in that it is weatherproof on the outside, has 3 FlexFold Dividers which allow endless internal configuration on the inside and has very comfortable straps and you know that is the one photography backpack to take everywhere!</p>
