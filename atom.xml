    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The skiing season 2019 isn‚Äôt over just yet - there‚Äôs still great snow to be shredded in the far North of Finland, as I experienced last weekend in Ruka.</p>

<p>As part of me trying to minimize my environmental footprint but unwilling to not ski I travelled last weekend by train and bus to Ruka-Kuusamo, some 500 kilometres from Vaasa away. Even with short stop-overs between switching from the train to the Bus it‚Äôs almost a 10 hour journey to get to Ruka, though as you can walk around in the train, there‚Äôs good internet and you can work there‚Äôs nothing to worry about. Though I was happy that I was able to get out on the hills once I arrived in Ruka, and with the lifts being open till 19 o‚Äôclock I got in a few hours of skiing on the slopes after a full day of travelling - not a bad start! And to make it even better, it had been snowing the whole Thursday and would continue throughout the night.</p>

<p>After the skiing I went to have Dinner at <a href="https://ruokburger.fi">RUOK Burger</a> which is just next door from my apartment in the <a href="https://www.ski-inn.fi/en/majoitus/ruka">Ruka Village Ski-Inn</a>. Their Portobello Burger was the only vegetarian option and super-tasty, and I accompanied it with a local Craft Beer from Rovaniemi, a nice Amber Lager. After that I retired to my cozy apartment, heated up the Sauna and watched how it was snowing outside. Being on ski holidays it is always great to watch it snow ‚ùÑÔ∏è as that means fresh powder the next day when you‚Äôre outside on the hills!</p>

<p>The next morning a bright blue sky woke me up, and all signs were on an amazing day on and off the slopes. There‚Äôs just something great about hitting the slopes and being one of the first ones there. I love painting my curves into the still un-shredded corduroy, and then Veera and me went into the side-country to look for some powder. And powder we found.</p>

<p>It really feels amazing to surf through the fluffy snow and throw up big swoops of the white gold. Veera and me both had big smiles on our faces after cruising through the powder-filled forests, so once it was noon we went to <a href="http://www.hankibaari.fi">Hanki Baari</a> for lunch, where I ate a tasty vegan Mie Goreng. Hanki Baari is either way an amazing place to chill after a day on the slopes, listening to music and drinking some fancy beers, though right now we just needed some good nutrition before hitting the slopes again.</p>

<p>So, after a coffee ‚òïÔ∏è it was time to go ride some more. After all, the sun was shining, the slopes were in prime condition and the lifts would be running till 23 o‚Äôclock (Fridays the Ruka Ski Resort‚Äôs lifts run so late because those who journey after work to Ruka still can hit the illuminated slopes!). However, we wouldn‚Äôt ski that long, as we had another plan.</p>

<p>We went on a little powder hunt with friends of Veera, which resulted in a short but exhausting climb through hip-deep snow back to the slopes from the lake ü§£ After that I went for a few more laps on the slopes before calling it a day. A quick shower later I was sitting in the <a href="https://www.pizzeriaruka.fi/en/">Pizzeria Ruka</a> which is probably the best Pizza you can get in Ruka. It‚Äôs a five minute stroll from the centre of the village to the Pizzeria, and their wood-fired oven served me in no time a delicious Tartufo Pizza. That‚Äôs exactly what I needed after almost six hours of skiing, and gave me enough energy for the hike we had planned for the evening.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://www.hendrikmorkel.com">photographer</a> I hate it to spend a gorgeous sunset inside, so I was happy that Veera and her dog were up for a sunset mission to Konttainen, a hill some 10 minutes away from Ruka. A steep 11 minute climb later we were on the top of Konttainen, and strolled towards the best spot in the house while the show was just starting. It‚Äôs soooooo much better to be outside in nature when the sun sets than sitting inside, and this definitely was an evening well spent. After the sun disappeared from view we gazed for a while onto the illuminated slopes of Ruka, and for a moment I was tempted to jump back into my <a href="http://bit.ly/2D2JtFL">ski boots</a> and go for some night skiing. But then I remembered my warm Sauna and the cold beer which were waiting for me, so I skipped the night skiing and relaxed in my apartment before calling it a night.</p>

<p>The next morning white clouds hung over the mountain and gave the slopes and village a sci-fi feel. I‚Äôs the kind of weather where you ponder if you should just stay inside and chill-lax, but as I wanted to get my skis on that didn‚Äôt happen and early on Saturday morning Veera and me where again on the slopes, searching for some untracked pockets of powder.</p>

<p>And slowly but surely the sun was burning through the clouds and as the day progressed the views came out again, and we also were lucky by finding some fine lines of untouched powder not far from the hustle and bustle of the slopes.</p>

<p>After all that off-piste skiing it was time to join the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/ski-pride">Ruka Ski Pride</a> Parade. I really ‚ù§Ô∏è that Ruka has this event which celebrates equal rites and diversity on the slopes, and the vibe was so positive and fun - I really enjoyed to be part of it üåà Besides this parade there were inclusive events the whole weekend, with concerts and DJs, and of course some good skiing!</p>

<p>And then the day was almost over again. But not before I skied one final time from the East to the West, and from the North to the South across the whole resort. I love to ski fast and go from one end of a resort to the other one, shredding down the slopes and throwing up clouds of slushy spring snow, and at the end of this Saturday my trusty <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/suunto-spartan-ultra-black-multifunktionsuhr/?pid=10239">Suunto Spartan Ultra</a> told me I had skied almost 50 km of distance this day, and I could tell by how my legs felt.</p>

<p>After some relaxing I met Mats for Dinner at <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/villisika">Villisika</a> from where you have the best view over the slopes, so while we were eating we could see how the snow groomers got the hill ready for the next day. Sadly, the next sunny day I wouldn‚Äôt be shredding the groomers, as I was sitting in the train and bus back south. But I have a feeling that I will travel North once more for more skiing before the winter truly ends ‚ùÑÔ∏è</p>

<h2 id="spring-skiing-in-ruka">Spring Skiing in Ruka</h2>

<p>As you can see above, winter isn‚Äôt over just yet in Finnish Lapland, even if it may feel like it here in the south where most of the snow is already gone. Until early May there‚Äôs plenty of great skiing to be had in Northern Finland, and if you‚Äôre like me and can not get enough of skiing and winter then you too should steal away for a weekend to Ruka for some spring skiing. The slopes in <a href="https://www.ruka.fi">Ruka</a> are open till early May, and between now and the closing of the slopes there‚Äôs every weekend a weekend of fun to be had: Next weekend, from the 11.4. - 14.4.2019 is the legendary <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/spring-break">Ruka Spring Break</a> which will enlighten those who like to Party between hitting the groomers. The <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/easter">Easter Weekend</a> has winter activities for the whole family on offer, and the first of May is the traditional <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/wappulounas">Wappulounas</a>, a get-together of the international snowboard community on the slopes of Ruka. So don‚Äôt ponder longer - go and get some of that spring snow!</p>

<h2 id="where-to-stay">Where to Stay</h2>

<p>I stayed at the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/rukasuites">Ski Inn</a> and liked my apartment in the centre of the village. It was a two minute stroll to the Gondola and lift, a one minute walk to the supermarket, and Hanki Baari was even in the same building so I didn‚Äôt had to go far for a beer! There‚Äôs plenty more <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/where-to-stay">places to stay in Ruka</a> for any budget, and if you‚Äôre pondering where to eat: Just follow my recommendations above or try any of the other restaurants in the village and it‚Äôs surroundings.</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-ruka">Getting to Ruka</h2>

<p>The most convenient way is to take the <a href="http://vr.fi">train</a> and <a href="https://matkahuolto.fi">bus</a> to Ruka, or if you come from abroad you can fly to the <a href="https://www.finavia.fi/en/airports/kuusamo">Kuusamo Airport</a> and take the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/getting-around">Ski Bus</a> to Ruka. On the train you can sleep, work and walk around, and during the bus trip you can enjoy the beautiful Finnish landscape while listening to your favourite tunes.</p>

Too bad too many people drive cars in our cities. <strong>Cars don‚Äôt belong in cities</strong> is a thought which we share in our family. Cars have their place, but for both humans and the environment, and also the aesthetics of our towns, it would be best if most of us would cycle to the grocery store, work and the cinema. That that is possible I want to show you in this article.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>I admit that <strong>#FuckCarsRideBikes</strong> is probably the best Hashtag I have invented. I dislike cars as they illustrate what is wrong with our cities &amp; towns: Everywhere we have multi-lane streets so that thousands of people who sit <em>alone</em> in their car can drive from A to B. What‚Äôs wrong about this is that the distances these people drive <strong>ALONE</strong> in their cars is statistically less than 5 km, or the distance which most of the readers of this blog hike in an hour in the hills or would be able to ride on a bike in 20 to 30 minutes. Add in that nowadays seemingly every other car driver is distracted while checking his or her phone, our ageing societies mean that there are more people who are physically less able to drive <strong>safely</strong>, and the emissions from cars which are bad for our health and you start to realize that we need to get rid of the majority of cars in cities and towns. That that is possible and that one can thrive without a car and <strong>get everything done</strong> is what I want to show today, and hopefully encourage you to ride more on your bike and drive less in your car.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-from-a-to-b">How to get from A to B</h2>

<p>The kids have hobbies, need to be brought to school and kindergarden, there‚Äôs the occasional thing to pick up at the post office and groceries for cooking at home also need to be bought and brought home. Add in a visit to the cinema, going for lunch with colleagues, <a href="https://youtu.be/v0ae-3BQzFM">playing games with friends</a>, swimming at the beach and oh, yeah, showing up at the office for work is also smart. <strong>Can one <em>REALLY</em> do all that by bike?</strong> Well, yes üòä</p>

<p>Statistically most people use their cars for journeys of three to five kilometre in length, which if you think about it, is insane. I ride with my kids, with the trailer behind me and my son on his own bike, in 15 minutes to the centre of Vaasa, which is about three kilometre away from our house. Pretty much all of it is on cycling lanes, and in the centre there‚Äôs dozens of parking places for bikes so one never needs to ponder ‚ÄúWhere do I park?‚Äù. It‚Äôs also free! If the weather is poor hardshells come on - living in a coastal town (= lots of wind, üå¨üí® all the time) means we are used to wearing a <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/windproof-jackets/?pid=10239">wind jacket</a> when we go outside - and when you arrive at the Caf√©, Restaurant or school you take it off. No problem!</p>

<p>This is not some kind of magic that only we can achieve. Most people have very short commutes and can do all of it by riding a bike, and did I mention that being on a bike is healthy and fun? I at least always feel very happy when I can ride my bike. I think the biggest hurdle to those who drive with a car everywhere is that they think that they can not cycle. The truth is - if you have learned to ride a bike, and own a bike, then you can bicycle. No one is expecting you to win the <a href="https://www.transcontinental.cc">Transcontinental Race</a> or going <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/active-holidays-in-are-sweden.html">Downhill mountain biking</a> but you likely just want go to the Caf√© or to the beach. You also don‚Äôt need to sell your car and go all in, but gradually try what you all can do by bike. Cycle to work two days a week, instead of taking the car to the gym take the bike to go grocery shopping, and if you want to go out and meet friends why not go cycle to that lovely Caf√© instead of taking the car? If you slowly phase out the use of a car you‚Äôll see that going by bike everywhere is easy - and not just for adults, also kids love to ride their bike. The smile my 3 year old daughter gives me when we cycle together is amazing, and while this obviously only are short distances like going to the Kindergarden, the playground and the library bus, it still allows her to get used to cycling. For longer distances she sits in the Thule Chariot, which is also great to transport stuff. And if it doesn‚Äôt fit on the bike or in the trailer I take the bus or use a Taxi. By not owning a car we save a minimum of 400‚Ç¨ per month on car-related expenses, and that are even in Finland quite a few Taxi rides.</p>

<h2 id="the-bikes">The Bikes</h2>

<p>Now I have been talking so much about our bikes - time to take a look at them! I have written before about my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/pelago-bicycles-stavanger.html">Pelago Stavanger</a> which I am now riding since five years. I bought for my wife some years ago a <a href="https://www.pelagobicycles.com/bicycles/airisto-commuter.html">Pelago Airisto</a> which she loves, and with both of these bikes we can pull the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/thule-chariot-cross2-kinderanhaenger/?pid=10239">Thule Chariot 2</a> where our daughter sits and rides with us. The Airisto is a fantastic bike and I got my wife the front basket as it makes transporting things so much easier. The Airisto also performs well for bike tours - we cycled for a week on √Öland with these bikes and had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Our son is on his fourth bike, and since about a year he is riding the <a href="https://woombikes.com/products/4?ls=en">woom 4 children‚Äôs bike</a> which has been his best bike to date. It‚Äôs not just light and grew with him, it also has 8 gears which made cycling up hills and in winter a lot easier. The bike handles very well (especially if compared to his older bikes) and it‚Äôs a pleasure to see him ride his bike proudly and having fun. A good bike which is the right size and easy to use makes all the difference in getting a child being willing to ride a bike year-around, from spring till winter, and the woom 4 certainly has made it easier for us parents to go cycling together - because the bike works flawlessly. We also have cycled some longer rides around Vaasa with him, and thanks to his woom bike he‚Äôs able to cycle up to 20 km without a problem.</p>

<p>Our son is wearing the <a href="https://woombikes.com/products/woom-helmet?ls=en">woom Helmet</a> which is good, though it‚Äôs not really made for the cold weather of Finland and the width adjustment knob broke in the middle of winter - we have been using the Helmet now in the max. size, which is either way what we needed. It‚Äôs a light and well-ventilated helmet and stands up to daily use. Similarly the <a href="https://woombikes.com/products/woom-radlicht">woom bike lights</a> had a battery which had problems coping with the Finnish winter, it only worked on a charge for a day or two max and then needed recharging, though I imagine this is not a problem in warmer climates. And we also got the easy to use <a href="https://woombikes.com/products/woom-radschloss?ls=en">woom chain lock</a>. You can put in your own code (and can change it easily, too) so that way the bike can always be securely locked when at school or in town.</p>

<p>The Thule Chariot 2 is an amazing trailer and honestly the most important piece of cycling gear for a family with small kids which wants to rely less on the car. The <a href="http://bit.ly/2FxaMIU">Chariot 2</a> has allowed us to transport both kids at the same time when they were younger, we can use it to transport large packages and it makes grocery shopping a breeze as you can fit a child and the groceries for a week in it with room to spare. We also have travelled with the bikes and the trailer on <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/08/cycling-and-bouldering-on-aland.html">√Öland</a> which was an amazing trip which combined the bikes, train and ferry for a lovely week of cycling in the Archipelago. The Thule Chariot also has flown with us when the kids were smaller, as it can be converted into a pram in one minute (or a sled if there‚Äôs enough snow!). This really is an amazing piece of equipment which is integral to our family not having a car, and I can foresee that even when our 3-year old daughter is old enough to cycle herself that we might keep the trailer for a while as it is so damn easy to transport large things with it.</p>

<p>Speaking of transporting, my <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/adventure-touring-bikes/920/920/p/21996/">Trek 920 Disc</a> has been an amazing bike for both transporting, urban commutes, fun rides and adventures. I can transport an unreasonable amount of stuff on it thanks to the two racks, and especially the front rack is one of the best things on a bike, ever (<em>Seriously, if there‚Äôs one thing you should get for your bike it is a front rack!</em>). I love this bike and even more after I made it <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/08/schwalbe-tubeless-easy-kit.html">tubeless</a> two years ago. If it would allow me to pull the Thule Chariot I probably would own only this one bike.</p>

<p>As we are a family and we have to transport kids, groceries and parcels every now and then, I think you understand why we are dreaming of a Cargobike. <a href="https://www.bakfiets.nl">There‚Äôs</a> <a href="http://www.larryvsharry.com">just</a> <a href="https://yubabikes.com">too</a> <a href="https://sblocs.bike">many</a> <a href="http://www.workcycles.com">options</a> and they‚Äôre also all a bit pricey, but maybe in the future we will change from the Thule Chariot to a Cargobike for transporting‚Ä¶</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40115659892/in/album-72157665520832018/" title="SBlocs Cargo Bike"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4720/40115659892_5b5a2abb36_b.jpg" width="1024" height="806" alt="SBlocs Cargo Bike" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then there‚Äôs the kick bike which our kids used when they were small. We had a <a href="https://www.puky.de/en/home">Puky</a> kick bike for both kids, and our daughter has been riding it since she was 1,5 years old. It‚Äôs something she really enjoys a lot and she is pretty good at it, and when we go to the playground, for a walk or to the library bus she takes the kick bike as that way the longer distances are no problem for her.</p>

<h2 id="come-rain-come-sunshine-we-ride">Come Rain, come Sunshine, we Ride</h2>

<p>Riding our bikes in any weather - from damn slippery roads to the rain and hot 30¬∞C days - needs a little planning garment-wise, though as you‚Äôre likely a backpacker or skier you have everything you need to ride in any climate. We just use our hiking garments for cycling, the most important thing is that they have a good freedom of movement. A wind or rain jacket and a rain pants are needed in foul weather, while in the summer we cycle in shorts and T-shirts. My wife and kids use a Helmet while I only use one on long bike rides - because <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/news/a24110027/bike-helmet-safety/">it‚Äôs OK to not wear a helmet</a>, as bicycle lanes make cycling safe and not a helmet. <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/gloves/recommended-use--cycling/?pid=10239">Windproof gloves</a> make sure your hands don‚Äôt freeze solid (they‚Äôre also recommended in windy summers as warm hands make cycling a lot more fun).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/33614272908/in/dateposted/" title="Rocking the Puky Kickbike"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7856/33614272908_075dbb2416_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Rocking the Puky Kickbike" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That‚Äôs really it what ones need to transporting oneself from A to B by bicycle - yes there‚Äôs lots of fancy things one can add to the bike but a basic bike, some gloves, maybe a helmet and depending on the weather a wind or rain jacket are all that is needed. In the future I‚Äôll write more about useful accessories for cycling, but that‚Äôs not the focus of this post!</p>

<h2 id="cant-do-without-car">Can‚Äôt do without car?</h2>

<p>If you can not be without a car - because you actually life far away from civilization - I would encourage you to at least not drive alone. Share a car with a neighbour or two, drive together, make less trips and if your car is old get a car which is fuel-efficient or is an electric car. Generally, sharing the car and driving together makes the use of a motorized vehicle more acceptable. Alternatively you could try a e-Bike as these allow you to go a bit faster and further without too much of your own muscle power, or have a look at something like the <a href="https://www.arcimoto.com">Arcimoto</a> if it needs to be a vehicle.</p>

<h2 id="go-ride-your-bike">Go Ride Your Bike!</h2>

<p>I hope you see it is easy, fun and healthy to not drive everywhere in a car and that using the bike for transportation in an urban environment makes a lot of sense. There‚Äôs no searching for a parking spot, you don‚Äôt need to go to the gym, you‚Äôre outside at the fresh air and are having fun. Having good bikes for the kids and getting them used from an early age to cycling helps to instil a happiness to bicycle everywhere in them, and also makes them more independent as you as a parent don‚Äôt need to drive them everywhere. So in conclusion I hope that you now, with the beginning of spring, try to cycle more! After all - it‚Äôs fun, healthy and allows you to be more outside, and isn‚Äôt that what we all enjoy the most?!</p>

<p><em>This article is part of the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/?pid=10239">Bergfreunde</a> Series of ‚ÄúSustainable Outdoors‚Äù and several bloggers write about this topic - you can find a list with the other articles at the end. We are not paid to write these articles and have full editorial control.</em></p>

<p>Going outdoors feels like a sustainable hobby - especially if you compare it to sports and hobbies which need large buildings or areas to be played &amp; practiced. But is it really sustainable to drive in a big car to a trail head, being dressed in garments made from oil-based materials and hiking in sensitive areas which contributes to land erosion and degradation? That is a question which I am pondering in this article, so read along to find out what in my opinion are our biggest ‚Äúsins‚Äù as backpackers.</p>

<h2 id="getting-there">Getting there</h2>

<p>Only very few of us life in nature and can start hiking or skiing from their doorstep - most of us life in towns and villages and need to travel to the start of a trail or to the hills. Those who read me since a while know that I neither have a driving license and our family also does not own a car. If I go backpacking somewhere it is always by public transportation, most usually a combination of train and bus when in Finland, or by ferry, plane and then bus or train when abroad. As I have been travelling like this since 20 years this is normal for me, but for those who have grown up with a car in front of their house this might seem strange. Yes, I am dependent on schedules and trains and busses to get somewhere, but I have learned to life with that and it usually works out nicely. My waiting time I use for reading and studying the map, or stocking up on calories!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/33621497524/in/album-72157681559831330/" title="Bikepacking Season is upon us!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4160/33621497524_40fe81d861_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Bikepacking Season is upon us!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Getting to a local trail here in Pohjanmaa means either jumping on a bike or taking a bus or train and possibly a Taxi. Sometimes I make the bike ride part of the journey and just call it a <em>Bikepacking and Hiking Adventure</em> as cool and catchy names are important =) I really love to ride my bike and it‚Äôs my favourite way to get around when in town or if I‚Äôm travelling, it just feels great. Going by train or bus is fine, though - I can charge my phone and listen to music or chat on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">Discord</a> and the speed is good and if going by bus I usually also can get off quite close to a trailhead and just hike the last bit.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44739826010/in/dateposted/" title="Golden Hour"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7863/44739826010_b8ec02619e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Golden Hour" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>When going abroad flying is something I hate. I hate the noise, the people and the emissions I accumulate while travelling by plane, but for long distances in a short time there‚Äôs no alternative for me right now. I am cutting down on my flights and assignments abroad drastically, though, and each trip I can realize by taking the ferry, train, bus and Taxi are a win in my book. Plus going by plane also often means I have to add a night in an <a href="https://www.airbnb.ca/c/hmorkel">AirBnB</a> or Hotel at the beginning or end, depending on the connections at the destination to get where I want to go which adds to the costs and length of a trip. But some trips are just too good to miss out on, like my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/06/hiking-the-causeway-coast-way.html">Causeway Coast Way thru-hike</a> or backpacking on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/10/snow-and-sunshine-on-the-via-dinarica.html">Via Dinarica</a> in Bosnia Herzegovina. These were amazing hikes and totally worth getting into a plane for, and also the John Muir Trail is high on my list, as well as several other trails abroad.</p>

<p>My take-away for <strong>getting there</strong> is probably to try to enjoy your local outdoors as much as possible. I know I am guilty of dreaming and hiking on distant trails, while I have a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/pack-sail-rafting-in-the-kvarken-archipelago.html">UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site</a> on my doorstep which would be great for packrafting, cycling and hiking. But the benefits of hiking locally are so many: You can hike more - have a free afternoon and day ahead? Just go to a local trail for a night out! Take the bike instead of the car if you feel like it, and for longer trips why not explore more of your own country?! If you fly somewhere for your yearly long backpacking trip - and you can! - <a href="https://mossy.earth/collections/carbon-offsetting">offset your emissions</a> by supporting reforestation measures or similar.</p>

<h2 id="the-gear">The Gear</h2>

<p>Another topic which we have to ponder is how sustainable our outdoor gear is. Unless you use exclusively natural materials like cotton, hemp, flax, wood or Merino wool chances are you have something that‚Äôs made from oil =&gt; plastic in any form or shape (it can be called Dyneema, XPac, Cuben fibre, Polyester, Nylon, Cordura or or or). The good thing is that most of our outdoor gear is so well made that it can last us a life-time with some proper care, so the environmental footprint of a tent which gets used several times per year is relatively small after 15 years of use.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9797321574/in/album-72157634403205347/" title="HMG UltaMid in a wet forest"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5502/9797321574_0b9435d015_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="HMG UltaMid in a wet forest" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Also, most new outdoor equipment is made from recycled or recyclable materials which is an amazing step forward. I remember my first <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/07/outdoor-news-i.html">OutDoor</a> where the sustainability topic was still in it‚Äôs baby shoes and I had more the feel of ‚ÄúGreenwashing‚Äù here and there. But now, five years later, it‚Äôs front and centre for many companies, and one of their most important messages. From <a href="http://bit.ly/2UNDeN1">Patagonia</a> who doesn‚Äôt want you to buy their jackets to Houdini which lets you <a href="https://www.houdinisportswear.com/ca/sustainability/houdini-rental">rent their garments</a> instead of buying them, many companies wake up and realize we need to do something to keep our outdoors healthy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46495574344/in/album-72157678997220548/" title="100%"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7826/46495574344_e4e77a6ca4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="100%" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But what‚Äôs even better is that many of our outdoor gear also can find it‚Äôs way into our everyday life. Don‚Äôt be dumb and only use your <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/hydro-flask-standard-mouth-with-standard-flex-cap/?pid=10239">Hydroflask</a> on the trail - take it with you when you go to work or walking the dog! Get a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/primus-vacuum-commuter-mug-isolierbecher/?pid=10239">good mug</a> for your coffee on the go, and also your lunch can be packed in a Light My Fire meal box. I also wear my outdoor clothes all the time - my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/houdini-womens-thrill-twill-mtm-pants-jeans/?pid=10239">hiking pants</a> are my every day pants as well, when I pick up my kids I wear my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Alpine Start Hoody</a> or a shell jacket and I don‚Äôt really use any other shoes than my trailrunning and hiking shoes. If you‚Äôre working at a office where a suit is mandatory you might not get away with wearing your outdoor garments all the time, but if your employer is relaxed about the dress code there‚Äôs no good reason why you can‚Äôt wear your flannel shirt and hiking trousers to the office.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47298836431/in/dateposted/" title="Time for some Coffee!"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7857/47298836431_ab751f6d7a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Time for some Coffee!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Finally, instead of buying a new piece of kit once an old one is broken might not be necessary - many pieces of equipment can be fixed, from stoves to garments. If a rain jacket doesn‚Äôt keep the rain out anymore it often just needs a wash with a good detergent to re-activate its waterproof properties, and if a tear is too big you can have it often much more cheaply fixed than buying a new one.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35450694064/in/album-72157686898441076/" title="Unscrew everything!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4307/35450694064_e2e659e43d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Unscrew everything!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="land-degradation">Land degradation</h2>

<p>Land degradation and erosion is especially a problem at very popular trails and areas - from the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2009/06/karhunkierros-i.html">Karhunkierros</a> in Finland to certain trails in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/a-lake-district-traverse.html">Lake District</a> and elsewhere, where a lot of people hike or ski the earth under our feet gets eroded and with rain and wind popular trails quickly can look like deep scars in the landscape. Well built and maintained trails minimize this problem, and also we can - by choosing to hike on ‚Äúless popular‚Äù trails. Now less popular does not equal less beautiful, and as many of us go into nature to escape busy cities it‚Äôs a smart thing to search out these less popular trails and enjoy them on your own.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29831354255/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Clearing up"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8528/29831354255_4688f96fa0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Clearing up" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If a trail gets really popular then trail erosion is often the smallest problem - often rubbish which is left behind, from üí© to plastic bottles and tissues - are a much bigger issue. What we as knowledgable outdoors men and women can do is to educate our fellow hikers when we catch them in the act, or collect the trash and carry it out. Carrying a small Ziplock bag for these situations is common for me, because I really hate it to see rubbish left in nature.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline--what-you-can-do">Bottomline &amp; What you can do</h2>

<p>My conclusion is that being outdoors, be it hiking, backpacking, biketouring, packrafting or ski-touring is inherently a sustainable activity. By spending time outdoors in nature we learn to care more about our planet, and in the long run we will adapt many of the things I have suggested throughout this article, though if you‚Äôre at the start of your hiking career and just started with backpacking you can now of course skip ahead and pick up these good behaviours and ideas!</p>

<p>To sum them up, these would be my three take-aways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Adventure more locally and take the bike, train and bus to get to the trailhead!</li>
  <li>Use your gear until the end! Resist the urge to buy new gear, repair what you have and consider renting or buying used gear.</li>
  <li>Search out less popular trails, keep <em>Leave No Trace</em> principles in mind and pick up other people‚Äôs trash if you encounter it outdoors.</li>
</ol>

<p>I also want to encourage you to not geo-tag your images online and generally share &amp; spend less time on un-social networks like Instagram and Facebook which both promote <strong>F</strong>ear <strong>O</strong>f <strong>M</strong>issing <strong>O</strong>ut and other negative feelings. Finally, <a href="https://twitter.com/gretathunberg">#FridaysForFuture</a> are not just for kids - also responsible Adults who are not happy about how those in our governments misuse their loaned power can take to the streets and demonstrate for politics which ensure our planet, including all these amazing National Parks, hiking trails and mountains remain for future generations. Take the ext Friday off and go demonstrate!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376393791/in/dateposted/" title="All Black Opinel | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7886/47376393791_09dc6f5ab2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="All Black Opinel | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This Opinel N¬∞08 Black Oak was my favourite piece of hardware on the show. It‚Äôs lightweight (45 g) and simply beautiful. It felt great in my hand and I think I want to pick one up.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376394441/in/dateposted/" title="Opinel for Kids! | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7827/47376394441_854312d114_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Opinel for Kids! | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Also the other goods from Opinel were top notch and especially the two sets for kids were amazing, as a father of a seven year old boy I really loved the wood carving set which lets the child build a small sail boat. Similarly, the kitchen knife set allows the kids to help safely in the kitchen - and cooking together is a lot of fun!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46653258814/in/dateposted/" title="Marttiini Damast Puukko | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7926/46653258814_77c2f67a99_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Marttiini Damast Puukko | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Also this Marttiini Damast Steel puukko was a work of art, Made in Finland. The birch handle is waxed and felt really good in my hand, and damast steel with it‚Äôs intriguing patterns is always an eye-catcher.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376395151/in/dateposted/" title="Swiza Knives | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7818/47376395151_22f4f4e076_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Swiza Knives | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Apparently <em>All Black</em> is a trend in the knife industry, also also the Swiss Brand Swiza had an All Black pocket knife. This one felt lightweight and could be a good knife for weight-conscious backpackers.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46461346595/in/dateposted/" title="Swiss Army Knives | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7846/46461346595_d62333c63c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Swiss Army Knives | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376420661/in/dateposted/" title="Victorinox Pocket Knives | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7867/47376420661_325faa6b7b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Victorinox Pocket Knives | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At Victorinox a person was showing some visitors how to carve with the knife in the middle, and it was interesting to watch. This Swiss Brand had a wide array of different knives, and it seems even some collectors editions.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376393431/in/dateposted/" title="Leatherman | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7896/47376393431_4ae59967c9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Leatherman | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47323558742/in/dateposted/" title="Mora Kniv Hook Knife | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7881/47323558742_2ea4e0497d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Mora Kniv Hook Knife | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47323558342/in/dateposted/" title="Mora Kniv Hook Knife | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7867/47323558342_729f99b76d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Mora Kniv Hook Knife | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And at Morakniv they were very proud of their new hook knife for carving, and it‚Äôs a great - and <strong>SHARP</strong> - knife for sure. This knife now finally comes with it‚Äôs own leather pouch which protects it during transport, which is a good thing. Also I learned that Mora produces some insane amount of knives each day - 20.000 to be exact!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376420281/in/dateposted/" title="Silky Saw | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7828/47376420281_bd5b354f70_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Silky Saw | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As I have around my house a large pine hedge which I cut once a year, a good saw is mandatory in our house. I checked out the Silky Saws booth and these Japanese saws looked amazing, I feel when my Fiskars saw is at the end of it‚Äôs life cycle I might replace it with a Silky one.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376402221/in/dateposted/" title="Damast Hultafors Axe"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4904/47376402221_68c3e95c90_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Damast Hultafors Axe" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376401981/in/dateposted/" title="Hultafors Axes"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7825/47376401981_5725ffa8b5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Hultafors Axes" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Hultafors from Sweden makes Axes since a loooong time, and their Hult√•n, √Öby and √Ögelsj√∂n hatchets felt amazing in hand. Sadly they didn‚Äôt have any wood for splitting along, but I am pretty sure these axes are up to the task! Oh, and that Damast Axe - it‚Äôs a unique piece which is unlikely to see mass production, and with a price tag of around 2.000‚Ç¨ it‚Äôs also more likely an Axe which you‚Äôll hang on your wall than using it in the forest.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40410897873/in/dateposted/" title="FixPlus Straps"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7833/40410897873_2b65657106_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="FixPlus Straps" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40410897363/in/dateposted/" title="FixPlus"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7872/40410897363_086a38ae9e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="FixPlus" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I met the guys from FixPlus which make lightweight straps with which you can connect your gear to all kinds of stuff - from closing your cook kit securely to attaching your skis to your bike, these are multiple use and lightweight - and unlike the classic Voil√© straps more durable and UV resistant.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376399691/in/dateposted/" title="Conscious Hunting"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7867/47376399691_e0d49cefa4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Conscious Hunting" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/33500200018/in/dateposted/" title="IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7827/33500200018_e9fe78152d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47323561142/in/dateposted/" title="IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7869/47323561142_8c23490be8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="616" alt="IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46461352175/in/dateposted/" title="Fj√§llr√§ven"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7888/46461352175_2e571a86b5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="667" alt="Fj√§llr√§ven" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Fj√§llr√§ven was with their sister companies at the fair and their new hunting trousers looked amazing - both very comfortable and made for a good time in the outdoors, in any weather. I liked the pattern, too, and imagine that we will see many people wear these for normal backpacking and hiking.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47323554502/in/dateposted/" title="Savotta Chimney | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7880/47323554502_1489a7d50f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Savotta Chimney | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Hawu Roll Chimney from Finnish brand Savotta was amazing if you‚Äôre into hot camping in winter, a really great chimney that‚Äôs easy to set up and pack down, and also works with UL wood stoves. At 1 kg it might be heavier than the Titanium foil UL options, but the Hawu was so easy to use that I wouldn‚Äôt bother with any other chimney.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47323553152/in/dateposted/" title="Polyver Boots | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7903/47323553152_e32bea251f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Polyver Boots | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And finally, as we‚Äôre still in the midst of winter here in Finland and Scandinavia, warm boots! Polyver Boots are Made in Sweden, not far away from <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/02/impressions-from-are.html">√Öre</a>, and are fairly lightweight - around 700 g for a Size 42 Premium Low boot, but hold on before you start to write <em>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not‚Ä¶.‚Äù</em> - these are made for cold weather activities. Like, -25¬∞C cold. Activities like ice fishing. And that‚Äôs where they will keep your toes toasty and dry, because waterproof they are too.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376403111/in/dateposted/" title="H√§rkil√§"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7863/47376403111_2f6cd485b0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="H√§rkil√§" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="take-aways">Take Aways</h2>

<p>As I have said for years in my wrap-ups of the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/06/outdoorfn-2017-re-cap.html">OutDoor Friedrichshafen</a> and ISPO shows, these happenings are less about the gear for me and more about the people. And I met great people at the IWA, which care for nature and enjoy their time in the fjells and forests. I too really enjoyed my first IWA show and seeing all the <em>new gear</em> which I never see at one of the usual shows I attend, and best of all I had ZERO meetings which meant I was free to stroll around the fair and look at the stuff I am interested in. And so I came home with new impressions of a new fair and outdoor market, and got to know some interesting new equipment. Let me know in the comments on Facebook or via Twitter if you found this article interesting, and if you saw some interesting kit! I‚Äôll leave you with some more impressions from the show and wish you a happy outdoor weekend!</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>It was a ridiculously busy show for me where I lost my DJI Ronin S Gimbal on the 2nd day (and got it back on the 3rd!), had 45 meetings and even saw a few pieces of exciting new gear. You can watch all my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqEBC4yj3FahCnppGZeGxAgFV0Oq07UnE">ISPO 2019 Videos on Youtube</a> in that handy Playlist, or watch my Recap/ Wrap-up underneath.</p>

<h2 id="exciting-new-gear">Exciting New Gear</h2>

<p><strong>THE Question</strong> at the show is usually ‚ÄúHave you seen something interesting?‚Äù. Usually I haven‚Äôt, but now, after having gone through my notes and having edited 36 Videos from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqEBC4yj3FahCnppGZeGxAgFV0Oq07UnE">ISPO 2019</a> I can say yeah, I have seen actually quite a few interesting things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Sustainability Trend Grows</li>
</ul>

<p>Before I became a photographer and writer I was an Environmental Management Consultant, so the topic of sustainability is something which is close to my heart. The Sustainability Trend has been growing each year, and after a few ‚ÄúScandals‚Äù (Gore-Tex PFCs, Microfibre-shedding, treatment of animals and people who make our gear) it is great to see such a positive trend across the whole industry. Mountain Equipment takes in your old down jackets and sleeping bags and makes the Earthrise Jacket out of it, Pyua makes a Vegan Jacket, PrimaLoft developed an insulation material which decomposes, Sympatex rides ahead of the wave giving us ideas how to become a circular economy, Houdini already uses only recycled, recyclable, renewable and biodegradable fabrics in their new collection, and many more good things have happened in the last five years. All this is positive as it minimizes our industries‚Äô and our own impact on the planet, ensuring that we keep the nature which we love so much in a good state.</p>

<ul>
  <li>More environmentally friendly synthetic fabrics</li>
</ul>

<p>I touched upon this above, but I really liked seeing big companies like PrimaLoft and Polartec addressing problems like microfibre shedding and making insulation decompose. Not everyone of us recycles their old outdoor garments and a fair share likely ends up in a landfill, so knowing that in the future these jackets will decompose is very positive. Likewise it is great to know that we can wash our Polartec Power Air jackets without the fear of contributing to the microfibre plastic pollution in our rivers, lakes and oceans. Add in that with a Sympatex or Nikwax garment you also keep PFcs out ofnature and you already today can dress up in a way that will not pollute the environment as badly as with other options.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Favourite Gear</li>
</ul>

<p>My favourite pieces of gear at the ISPO 2019 were the La Sportiva TX Top, the Houdini Power Air Houdi and some items from Spectra Fibre. I love my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/08/la-sportiva-tx2-review.html">La Sportiva TX2</a> and also the Crossover 2.0 GTX, so getting a combination of the two is amazing. As I wear a fleece Houdi all the time (like, right now while writing this article) I also really fancied the Houdini Power Air Houdi. Sadly I was too late in buying one, though hopefully they will get my size back in stock soon. I also stopped by at the booth of Spectra Fibre and it was exciting to see a new brand entering the industry with lightweight fabrics. These should work well for a variety of UL Outdoor gear, from backpacks to tents and bivy bags. Right now NW Alpine is one of the few companies which uses this material, but I‚Äôm certain more will follow!</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>

<p>It was obvious that there were less exhibitors and less visitors - the latter can be blamed in part on the weather, as Munich got hit by a proper load of snow this year on the first day of the show, and there were a lot of flights cancelled. But I think it also shows that these kind of trade fairs become less &amp; less a ‚ÄúMust-Be-There‚Äù event for many brands. Right now the ISPO is too late in the year for many retailers to see the new gear and make orders, and for us content creators both online and in print it‚Äôs quite hectic. I myself likely will not attend the new Summer ISPO show in June, because it‚Äôs a fairly expensive trip for me and if I can pick between having 12 hour days in Munich or chilling at the sea, painting Minis and playing board games I‚Äôm very much inclined to opt for the latter. I am, however, pondering visiting OR in Denver, though that also is connected to costs.

<p>If ‚Äú<a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-the-bregenzerwald.html">Bregenzerwald</a>‚Äù and ‚Äú<a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-vorarlberg.html">Vorarlberg</a>‚Äù sound familiar to long-time readers of the blog, the reason is that I have been there with the family three years ago in the summer. We loved our stay and after I saw Warth briefly last year on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/03/impressions-from-the-mdv-transalp.html">MDV Transalp</a> I decided it‚Äôd be just the right place to go after ISPO 2019. But as skiing alone is boring and making photos of one skiing alone is pretty difficult, I asked my friend Bj√∂rn from the <a href="https://st-bergweh.de">St. Bergweh</a> Blog if he‚Äôd like to accompany me. Bj√∂rn is a great Snowboarder and we have similar values, so I was happy when he agreed to join on this trip! What follows are just a few visual impressions from this long weekend in Warth, the long-form article will follow in a bit!</p>

<p>We were lucky enough to also meet up with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/posayshirts/">Nina</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dirkofposay/">Dirk</a> and have a fun afternoon with them. They live during the ski season down in Vorarlberg and hence know a lot of great secret spots!</p>

<p>We skied both on the slopes of <a href="https://www.warth-schroecken.com/en/warth-schroecken-ski-area.html">Warth-Schr√∂cken</a> and <a href="https://www.skiarlberg.at/en">Ski Arlberg</a>, to which the former belongs, while the latter is the largest skiing resort of Austria. But besides hitting the slopes we also found a few spots of untracked powder, which we enjoyed to no small degree.</p>

<p>After my visit to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/active-holidays-in-are-sweden.html">√Öre in the autumn</a> I knew I wanted to come back, and that I should bring my family so we can experience the beauty of the Swedish mountains together! Again we travelled by ferry and train to this little village, which is in the midst of preparing for the √Öre 2019 FIS Alpine World Ski Championship which start next week! As usual, this is a photo-intensive article which gives you a taste of the stories which will come when I return from the ISPO 2019 in Munich and some skiing in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-vorarlberg.html">Vorarlberg</a>!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/33072013328/in/dateposted/" title="Our 3-year old is learning to ski"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7880/33072013328_840ef2cb4e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Our 3-year old is learning to ski" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Our 3-year old daughter learned to ski ‚ù§Ô∏è The smile on her face is amazing, and we are so proud of her!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46947607191/in/dateposted/" title="Hermelinbacken"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7842/46947607191_d781491601_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hermelinbacken" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Similarly, our 7 year old son also improved his skiing by bounds! While he learned to ski some years ago in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/01/skiing-in-vuokatti.html">Vuokatti</a> this year in √Öre he went big and bold! I had many great runs with him, and look forward to many more!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46947604541/in/dateposted/" title="Off to √Öre!"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7806/46947604541_0766fe9f36_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Off to √Öre!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Also my wife and me had some time with one of the friendly Ski School instructors! I got a reminder on how to better control my skis and tips on getting down steep, shitty runs.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46947605971/in/dateposted/" title="Illuminated runs"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7863/46947605971_ecec5f9340_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Illuminated runs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There also was some night skiing.</p>

<p>And visits to the village for some Pizza, swimming, coffee and grocery shopping.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46947607411/in/dateposted/" title="Up &amp; Down"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4809/46947607411_0193794260_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Up &amp; Down" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Of course there was lots and lots of great skiing on the slopes.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44739872230/in/dateposted/" title="Sunset"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4903/44739872230_1866fd915a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Sunset" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Dear Readers, another year has passed and I hope you, your friends and family had a few relaxing days, a good start into 2019 and that your backpack didn‚Äôt get that much heavier with all them luxury items which Santa dropped off for you =) I spend December mostly with work and then took over the holidays a few free days, and then planned out my 2019 - as an entrepreneur that‚Äôs something which is quite important. I also set out a few goals, for example I want to run more each week, become a better skier, and be more efficient with my time. I also hope to make 2019 financially a better year for me than 2018, and I have outlined a few ways I can achieve that.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/45643852635/in/dateposted/" title="Autumn meets Winter"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7809/45643852635_84e48b5b46_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Autumn meets Winter" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The long planned blog refresh will have to wait still a bit I reckon, as I plan to concentrate more on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hendrikmorkel">my Youtube Channel</a>. If you haven‚Äôt subscribed yet I‚Äôd appreciate it if you check it out, and if it is something to your likes hit that subscribe button. Here is a video I shot a couple of weeks ago, for example, though don‚Äôt worry: The Blog isn‚Äôt going away and I will maintain it regularly (more on that underneath).</p>

<p>On the other hand I grew pretty tired of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikmorkel/">Instagram</a>, which is a time-consuming beast which I will fed less in 2019. I still enjoy <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a> while <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/">Facebook</a> is alright, but both of these are good ways to get in touch with me if you have a question - or just <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/about/">Email me</a>.</p>

<p>Trip-wise I decided to put my feet where my mouth is - and that means more trips in Finland, as well as Sweden and Norway. I am very happy that Climate Change is such a huge topic in normal Media and Politics right now, and hence I decided to take on a lot less assignments which require me to fly. I will fly to the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/02/2018-ispo-impressions.html">ISPO in Munich</a> later in February (even if I don‚Äôt like the city + fair that much) as it is a good place to meet new clients and start new projects. Plus I will again film a lot of videos about new exciting gear! After the fair I will head to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-vorarlberg.html">Vorarlberg</a> with my friend <a href="https://st-bergweh.de">Bj√∂rn from St. Bergweh</a> for some skiing, and then I have some cool ideas for inspiring winter trips here in Finland.</p>

<p>Of course there will also be <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/the-week-in-review/">The Week In Review</a> and detailed gear reviews, trip reports and the one and other opinion piece here on the blog! And as always: If there is something you‚Äôd like to see or read - let me know in the comments or on <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a>! Thank you so much for reading, and I am looking forward to inspire and entertain you in 2019!</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://rab.equipment/uk/microlight-alpine-324">Rab Microlight Alpine Jacket</a> arrived in time for autumn backpacking trips with me, and has been along on two long backpacking trips this fall, and several photography assignments. It has seen over three weeks of use, and will see many more!</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>Well, <em>for me</em> this is a jacket which stays in the backpack until I stop to make a break or arrive at camp, where it comes out and on. Depending on the weather and pace it also gets worn when on the move, but as I am running easily hot I find wearing a down jacket for hiking absolutely not good as I quickly am sweating too much then. But for outdoor and landscape photography it is great again - especially right now as the temperatures are only around -7¬∞C and windy. But I digress. The main function of a down jacket is obviously to keep the wearer warm in cold weather.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The features as Rab sees them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pertex Quantum inner and outer fabric</li>
  <li>750FP Ethically-Sourced European Goose Down</li>
  <li>Rab Fluorocarbon free Hydrophobic Down developed in conjunction with Nikwax</li>
  <li>Micro stitch-through baffle construction</li>
  <li>Adjustable hood with laminated brim and flexible polymer peak</li>
  <li>Diverted hood baffle lines for an anatomical fit</li>
  <li>YKK reverse coil front zip with insulated zip baffle and chin guard</li>
  <li>2 YKK reverse coil harness compatible hand pockets</li>
  <li>YKK reverse coil chest pocket</li>
  <li>Clean finish elasticated cuff construction</li>
  <li>Hem construction with dual drawcord adjustment</li>
  <li>Comes with a Stuff sack</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>In recent <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">reviews</a> this is usually a section where I write ‚ÄúNope, no innovations here.‚Äù Well, not this time! We got a hood which lays flat when not on your head - really nice! The <em>Responsible Down</em> isn‚Äôt super-new anymore, though nevertheless it is good to see that this jacket uses Ethically-Sourced European Goose Down, which is Hydrophobic on top.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>Rab wouldn‚Äôt be where they are today if they wouldn‚Äôt make high-quality kit, and the Microlight Alpine Jacket is no exception.</p>

<p>My red Microlight Alpine Jacket weighs 377 g in Size S, with the included Stuff Sack adding 12 g.</p>

<p>One of my first ultralight garments was the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2009/08/gear-talk-rab-microlite-vest.html">Rab Microlight Vest</a>, a great piece of kit, so when I saw the <a href="https://youtu.be/gErSMWPa6FM">Microlight Jacket</a> at the ISPO earlier this year I knew I wanted one and take it out into the hills. Since it has arrived this jacket has not disappointed and it has been used a lot since - as it has been fresh outside in recent weeks it was good to have a light and warm jacket to put on when I head out to shot videos or take photos.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32245615858/in/dateposted/" title="Feeling warm"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4822/32245615858_46a6584926_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Feeling warm" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The main use obvious remains for me as an insulation piece when I go backpacking. For that I need the jacket to fulfil three things: It needs to be light, it needs to pack down small &amp; compact as it will be the majority of the time in the backpack, getting carried around, and the third thing is that it needs to be warm - or toasty as I like to say! As you can see from the photos here, on the accounts of being light &amp; compact the Microlight Alpine scores very well, and I find it a toasty warm jacket, too. While many people like to use a down jacket as a midlayer, it‚Äôs that only for me if it really, <em>really</em> cold. I wear the Microlight Alpine usually at camp over a shirt and midlayer, and thanks to the DWR coating of the Pertex fabric it also withstands some rain and keeps the wind at bay.</p>

<p>So after a day of being carried around, being put on in breaks throughout the day, the down jacket comes on as soon as I arrive at camp. If it is raining I will put the Microlight Alpine on and put my hardshell over it, though even when it has Hydrophobic Down I don‚Äôt want to wet out the down jacket. I‚Äôll potter around camp with the jacket on, usually taking photos and videos till late at night when the conditions are good, and then get to sleep. That‚Äôs where the Rab Microlight Alpine Jacket can perform it‚Äôs third crucial task: Rolled together into the hood it makes for a comfortable pillow. I stopped carrying a pillow several years ago and now always use a puffy insulation garment for that task, and the Microlight Alpine makes for a comfortable and warm pillow to rest my head on.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46116804501/in/dateposted/" title="Rolled up as a Pillow"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4906/46116804501_497a6fc705_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Rolled up as a Pillow" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Microlight Alpine has not one, not two, no, it has <strong>three zippered pockets</strong>. Hallelujah! I love zippered pockets. There‚Äôs so many down jackets which have no zippered pockets - and while that saves weight I always find that a shortcoming. Zippered pockets mean you can not lose the things you put in them (if you remember to <em>close</em> the zipper!) and especially if I am out taking photos or videos that is so useful. In them pockets I can store my remote, filters, cables and other things, without needing to worry that they drop out when I scramble around to look for a better perspective.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32245612528/in/dateposted/" title="Great hand pockets"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4826/32245612528_790a7d5f77_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Great hand pockets" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32245610538/in/dateposted/" title="Spacious chest pocket"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4841/32245610538_f4a3e80c33_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Spacious chest pocket" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now the Microlight Alpine has a hood, and it is a good and warm one. It has a brim and peak and both are really well implemented in my opinion, they let you see everything but keep possible snow or rain out of your face. The only thing which I find not super is that the adjustment cords are on the inside of the jacket, I prefer these on the outside as it makes it easier to adjust them. On the inside there is also a fleece lining around the area of your chin and neck, which feels much better against the skin as a cold zipper.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>Well, I always could do with an even lighter jacket - maybe one which is <a href="https://rab.equipment/us/zero-g-jacket">filled with 1000 cuin down and is made from a 7D fabric</a>?! Seriously though, I find it slightly annoying that the adjustment cords for the hood and hem are on the inside of the jacket, which for me means I need to adjust them with the jacket open. On the plus side, if you do this at home when you get the jacket, and not at -10¬∞C in a freezing cold wind, you probably will be fine! Sometimes it also feels that the jacket needs a wee bit long to loft (that the down decompresses) but I don‚Äôt think this has a huge impact of the warmth - at least I always felt warm as soon as I put it on.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32245626648/in/dateposted/" title="Inside hem adjusters"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4824/32245626648_eff16968a6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Inside hem adjusters" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>Throughout the last ten years I have used many down garments, though I often tend to come back to those favourites when I can. The Rab Microlight Alpine Jacket has already become such a favourite - it is toasty warm, packs compact and is light. It looks good on photos which for my work is pretty important, too. The three zippered pockets are wonderful, and if it is only to have my hands out of the cold wind. When I head out on a photo shoot this is an essential piece along from autumn till spring, and it will find it‚Äôs way into my backpack year-around when I go out backpacking where it also performs well as a pillow. It has the freedom of movement to also allow me to go ice climbing and ski-touring in it, so I will try that this winter with it, too - after all, it is made for the alpine!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9763145235/in/album-72157635543361552/" title="Mountain Laurel Designs TrailStar"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3700/9763145235_51b887b518_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Mountain Laurel Designs TrailStar" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Ten years ago I was mostly backpacking on my own. Even when out with friends, we usually each had our own tarp or shelter, an own stove, and so on. Then I met my wife, we had two kids, and now we once or twice a year go out camping as a family. As the kids are still small it are easy affairs with short hikes, lots of snacks and play time, and pretty much only in warm, comfortable weather. Many of my readers are in a similar situation, and as gear nerds the question comes up: ‚Äú<em>Which equipment can I use for myself on a Solo trip <strong>AND</strong> also use when out with the family?</em>‚Äù. Over the past seven years I have done plenty of research, trial and error, and this are my findings on how to scale gear from 1 Person to 3 Persons or more.</p>

<h2 id="my-home-is-my-castle">My Home is my Castle</h2>

<p>When I‚Äôm out on my own I value space in a shelter. That‚Äôs dry space, protected at a minimum from rain and wind, and possibly even from bugs and moisture from the ground. Shelters which adapt well from one person to two or more are Pyramid shelters in my experience. The main benefit is that even large, spacious Pyramids can be very light - like the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/hyperlite-mountain-gear-ultamid.html">Hyperlite Mountain Gear UltaMid</a>, the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/02/locus-gear-khufu-sil-review.html">Locus Gear Khufu</a> or the <a href="https://mountainlaureldesigns.com/product/trailstar/">Mountain Laurel Designs TrailStar</a>. If I use these on my own they are a little palace with all the space I want, though if my wife, a friend or a child is along we also both, with our backpacks and equipment, still fit comfortably into these shelters. Now if we‚Äôd go backpacking with the whole family we would need to size up - either to a larger Pyramide (like the <a href="http://bit.ly/2rhAIBL">UltaMid 4</a>) or to two shelters where one adult sleeps with one child. These shelters have the option to get an inner for insect and ground protection, which is useful if the mosquitos and other bugs are out. The biggest advantage to these kind of shelters is that they are very light in comparison to other options - a Pyramide can be around 500 g if made from Silnylon, and even lighter when made from Cuben (or Dyneema Composite Fabric as it is known nowadays). Lighter, but usually with less protection, are only Tarps. These offer beautiful views in good weather, but also their openess can be discomforting to those who are not used to sleep truly <em>outside</em>, so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them for starters.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9771060672/in/album-72157634403205347/" title="Space two"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7330/9771060672_54c9b307ed_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Space two" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>An alternative to Pyramide-Style Shelters are tents. These are heavier, but come with an inner and outer, so insect protection is included, and one has a clean floor, too, which is useful when one has small kids which like to put everything into their mouth. Also, happily many tent manufacturers have realized that not all tents have to be blizzard-proof winter bunkers. As a Helsport Ambassador I really like the <a href="https://www.helsport.no/lofoten-superlight-camp">Lofoten Superlite Camp 3</a> which is also the tent I used on my last two week-long backpacking trips with my best friend. This tent can sleep three and weighs around 2 kg, which is really great. It also has a large porch where gear can be stored and food be cooked, and in bad weather one also could play there. While maybe a bit too heavy when backpacking alone (there‚Äôs so many great 1P Tents available athat are around 1 kg or less heavy) if you want a tent which can accommodate more when needed, a tent like the Lofoten Superlite Camp 3 is a really good option.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31146548867/in/dateposted/" title="Helsport Lofoten Superlite Camp 3 somewhere in the Spanish Pyrenees"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4875/31146548867_d03b5bee2f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Helsport Lofoten Superlite Camp 3 somewhere in the Spanish Pyrenees" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="happy-meals">Happy Meals</h2>

<p>Stoves are tricky, especially if more than two persons are trekking together. I own several stove systems and on the trips with my best friend we always use together one of these gas stoves, where the pots have a volume of up to 700 ml. This has worked perfectly for us the last seven years, and of course when I‚Äôm on my own using one of these it is perfectly fine, too (then I can boil the water for a coffee and Porrige in one go!). Also when out with three or four I think such a ‚ÄúSolo‚Äù Stove works well for a group up to four, as in that case one just boils two times - first the water for the kids, then the water for the parents. This obviously only works when one uses Dehydrated Meals, which in my experience again is fine for kids, too (especially if they get a tasty treat afterwards). Not having dishes to clean is wonderful, and eating out of the bag can be novel and fun for small adventurers.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44734046631/in/album-72157673511250268/" title="Lunch break"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1841/44734046631_e9a9e914d2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lunch break" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So using a Solo Stove System like the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/msr-windburner-10-l-personal-stove-system-stove-system/?pid=10239">MSR Windboiler</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/2zuL85d">Jetboil MiniMo</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/2zrANH9">GSI Outdoors Halulite Microdualist Complete Stove</a> or <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/primus-lite-gas-stoves/?pid=10239">Primus Lite+</a> works great on Solo trips and with up to three more friends. After that, or if one really wants to cook (and do the dishes!), it is better to use a larger stove and pot combo. Or, if one is fortunate to be hiking in Finland and is staying at a campsite with a fire place, one could just bring a large <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/msr-big-titan-kettle-pot/?pid=10239">Titanium</a> or <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/sea-to-summit-alpha-pot-pot/?pid=10239">Aluminium pot</a> which can be used over the fire to boil water for all or cook.</p>

<h2 id="warm-nights">Warm Nights</h2>

<p>Getting an additional sleep system (so a mattress and a quilt or sleeping bag) for your partner or kids is necessary - unless you‚Äôre an Ultralight Backpacker which owns a combination of quilts and sleeping mattresses for different seasons. In that case the really warm winter quilt + mat go to the partner or child, the second warmest setup goes to a child, and you yourself use the lightest summer setup - and if it is a wee bit colder, just wear a warm fleece pants &amp; jacket and you‚Äôre fine. As I‚Äôm such a gear nerd that I own several mattresses and quilts this method has worked really good for us and we could avoid buying quilts and mattresses for the kids thus far - especially since they are only a night or three out per year, I wouldn‚Äôt want to invest money into gear that gets used so little and possibly gets to small in a year or three. It‚Äôs much better to have them use the adult setups - this saves money for nice treats or trips (or most likely, both!).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42251988122/in/album-72157669299782358/" title="Back view"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/950/42251988122_a439f03406_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Back view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="other-gear-that-can-be-scaled">Other Gear that can be scaled</h2>

<p>We each own our own water bottles but we share one <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/katadyn-befree-filter-3l-water-filter/?pid=10239">water filter</a>. I don‚Äôt want to spend 60‚Ç¨ on an additional filter - and truth be told, the <a href="https://youtu.be/CneJY3F6zuY">Katadyn BeFree</a> has such a high flow rate that it‚Äôs fast enough to fill up four bottles in a 5 Minute break.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44269585090/in/dateposted/" title="Katadyn BeFree Waterfilter"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4868/44269585090_fb6454a470_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Katadyn BeFree Waterfilter" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now backpacks can not really be <em>‚Äúscaled‚Äù</em> BUT you can own a backpack which easily can fit more gear - as you likely will make the hike for your partner and/ or kids as comfortable as possible and carry some of their equipment. A rucksack with an expandable rolltop closure - like in many <a href="http://bit.ly/2r4YKzI">Hyperlite Mountain Gear backpacks</a> - and a good compression system - like the <a href="http://bit.ly/2P6UCbM">ULA Ohm</a> - makes it easy to have one backpack which works well with smaller solo backpacking loads and larger two, three person loads. This is something to keep in mind if you‚Äôre buying a pack - will you need to carry just your gear, or also the gear of another person on occassions?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16219705131/in/album-72157648982512379/" title="Viewing the view stop"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7514/16219705131_dd6c0e5321_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Viewing the view stop" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>

<p>Much of the gear presented here works very well for both a two or three person trip <em>AND</em> a solo hike - the latter likely at a slight weight penalty as you might be using a 2 Person Shelter for sleeping instead of a 1 Person one, a more voluminous backpack (which again comes in useful if you go on a long solo hike or add in packrafting gear), a larger stove system or filter. But on the plus side, this means whenever your friends, family or kids want to go out with you backpacking to find out <strong>Why you like being outdoors so much</strong> you have the kit to take them along and show them. And that, in the end, is really worth it to carry a few grams more for the rest of the year üòä</p>

<p>The Osprey Exos 48 is a lightweight backpack which carries loads up to 15 kg very comfortable. I found the 48 l of Volume enough for a week long backpacking trip with all my camera gear and Drone and think it would be an ideal backpack for people who look for a lighter backpack which doesn‚Äôt brake the bank. For all the details <a href="https://youtu.be/bd5ugrAAerE">watch the video</a> and read the review.</p>

<p>I received my <a href="https://www.ospreyeurope.com/shop/eu_en/exos-48-2018">Osprey Exos</a> 48 in January 2018 and have used it on a several day trips and a week long backpacking trip in the Pyrenees of Andorra, Spain and France. Overall it has been used for close to two weeks.</p>

<p>The function of a backpack is to carry your gear in comfort from A to B. The idea behind a lightweight backpack is that it isn‚Äôt weighing 2+ kg empty, but significantly less, making the hiking part of a trip more comfortable. The backpack also should protect your gear from the elements and allow fast &amp; easy access to important pieces of gear which you need on the go.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>Straight from Osprey‚Äôs Website, here are the features of the Exos 48:</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>There‚Äôs for me no technical innovations in this pack, though as the Exos came out several years ago it was one of the first lightweight backpacks with a ventilated back panel, and also the Stow-on-the-Go trekking pole attachment system was innovative back then.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>It is a very well made pack that surely will keep you happy for many, many hiking &amp; backpacking seasons to come, and the 48 l Volume pack is great if you‚Äôre looking for one backpack which does it all - from day trips to one week long hikes in the backcountry.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/45261247534/in/dateposted/" title="Osprey Exos 48"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4866/45261247534_fc2192f24c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Osprey Exos 48" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>My Osprey Exos 48 in Back length L weighs 1.185 g empty, and the removable lid is 120 g.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>So I have used the Exos 48 on my seven day backpacking trip through Andorra, Spain and France where I carried around 17 kg of weight at the start of the hike, that was with water, food for 7 days and around 6 kg of camera gear. It‚Äôs a lot of weight and as someone who really doesn‚Äôt like to carry heavy loads seeing that number is scary. However, the reality was that it was not so bad. In part the ExoForm shoulder straps and hipbelt are responsible for that, because they are so damn comfortable that even such a heavy load was acceptable to carry. With every meal consumed the pack also got lighter and hence it got easier and more comfortable to carry the backpack. The <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/03/osprey-exos-vs-osprey-levity.html">difference between the Levity and Exos</a> I have shown in an article in the spring and now, after a lot of use of both packs, I have to say that I find the Exos for my needs the better pack, even if it is 400 g heavier.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/45936141812/in/dateposted/" title="Osprey Exos 48 and Osprey Levity 60"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4861/45936141812_5ee486b85d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Osprey Exos 48 and Osprey Levity 60" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>What makes it better for me is not just the additional volume of the pack (that 3 l extra of the Exos means I can carry my camera gear a lot easier inside the pack!), but especially the <strong>Stretchy Side Pockets</strong> of the Exos which are making it for me more useable. My friend Martin bought the Levity 60 after he read my review in the spring, but also the production model of that pack had not very stretchy side pockets (something that I complained about in my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/01/osprey-levity-45-review.html">Levity review</a>) and so I usually had to give him his water bottle and stow it away again. That‚Äôs not a problem if you hike with a friend, but if you hike Solo then it means stopping, taking the pack off, getting your water, packing it back and then putting the rucksack on again. With the Exos I can get everything in the side pockets while I move, which I really love.</p>

<p>I also feel that the little bit of extra volume of the Exos makes it more versatile pack for most people. The 48 l pack can be used on day hikes and on one-week long backpacking trips, and also people who just start out with lightweight backpacking and own more bulky &amp; heavier gear will find it easier to get it in the Exos and carry it in more comfort. I also liked that there were two lid pockets - that meant for me more organization as I could stow less important things like my Passport and keys, which I still want to keep close, in the Mesh pocket, while the more important stuff - phone, wallet, map, spare battery - goes in the top pocket. Funnily enough I‚Äôm flexible enough to also open and close the top lid pocket, which allows me to access the things in there with the backpack on my shoulders.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/45985403731/in/dateposted/" title="Osprey Exos 48"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4808/45985403731_8a53775cbb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Osprey Exos 48" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Airspeed backpanel, compression straps, Ice Axe loop and other features of the Exos work well, and the pack also is highly water-resistant - at least during rain and snow all the content stayed dry, also without a rain cover. The material is durable and one doesn‚Äôt need to treat the pack super-carefully, and the shoulder straps accept the <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/collections/clips/?rfsn=1845073.d8e1f">Peak Design Capture Clip</a> just fine (it‚Äôs a tight fit, but it goes on there).</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I‚Äôd take the flap off which protects the drawcord closure of the main compartment when one doesn‚Äôt want to use the lid pocket. That probably will make the pack around 25 g lighter, and it won‚Äôt get in the way when one uses the lid.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>At 1.185 g in Size L the Osprey Exos is a fantastic backpack for people who come from a more traditional approach of backpacking &amp; who are lightening up their load or for ultralight backpackers who want to have a backpack which carries really comfortably. The thick ExoForm shoulder straps make carrying loads of up to 15 kg an enjoyable affair, though the lighter the pack the more comfy it will be. I feel the ideal weight is around 12 kg with kit, food and water for this pack, so if that‚Äôs your usual weight with consumables you probably really will enjoy this pack. I liked the spacious and easy to access stretchy side pockets, the front pocket can swallow a lot of gear, and the two lid pockets helped me with keeping my stuff organized. I didn‚Äôt miss Hipbelt pockets at all, and could have done without the lid flap and Stow-on-the-Go trekking pole attachment thingy as I rarely use poles and always will use the lid, but other than that I found it an amazing pack. Add in that it‚Äôs fairly easy to find it for around 150‚Ç¨ or less and you‚Äôll understand why it is such a popular backpack!</p>

<p>Lets be realistic: Unless you started with the hobby of backpacking, climbing, packrafting or trailrunning <em>just last weekend</em> you likely own already everything you need. And if you were hiking for the first time in your life this month - well, the garments and pack you wore are just fine for the next three hiking weekends at least. So in stead of investing your hard earned ‚Ç¨$¬£ over the next weeks into things you very likely don‚Äôt need, invest it into something good. Support a NGO like <a href="https://protectourwinters.org">Protect our Winters</a> or <a href="https://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org">1% For The Planet</a>, go eat out with your friends or family, or use that money to go on a trip (<a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/destinations/">Here you can find some inspiration</a>). Hell, you even could become a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">Patreon of this website</a> and support my writing, photography and videos!</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>The <a href="">Gregory Optic 48</a> is a lightweight backpack that can carry heavier loads up to 17 kg in good comfort, though it really shines when used with a lightweight load of 9 to 11 kg. Smart details like easily accessible side mesh pockets, good hipbelt pockets and a large front mesh pocket make this a great entry of the 40 year old brand into the lightweight backpacking niche. <a href="https://youtu.be/NQsQYYp34qU">Watch the video</a> to see the pack in action:</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>The pack arrived during the summer at the Hiking in Finland HQ and has been out for dayhikes and a 90+ km off-trail trip in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/09/impressions-from-are-and-valadalen.html">V√•l√•dalen</a>, Sweden.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>As you can imagine, the function of a backpack is to carry your gear. The Gregory Optic 48 wants to do this in comfort, in a light package, and one that last you a life time.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30173126507/in/dateposted/" title="Taking in that view"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1969/30173126507_822b2a8317_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Taking in that view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>Straight from the Gregory Optic Website, here‚Äôs the list of features this pack has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An included raincover</li>
  <li>A removable lid and an included lid flap</li>
  <li>An internal hydration sleeve and a port</li>
  <li>A Sunglass stow on the shoulder strap</li>
  <li>Spacious front mesh pocket</li>
  <li>Side mesh pockets with quick access waterbottle stow</li>
</ul>

<p>The backpack is available in a small, medium and large back length and you should measure your back to get the right size.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/45061734512/in/dateposted/" title="Break on the pass"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1927/45061734512_5baf247e39_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Break on the pass" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>I didn‚Äôt find any technical innovations in the pack, all the features have been seen before, also in packs of a similar or lighter weight. Gregory probably disagrees, as they find their AeroSpan Suspension an innovation (it is a lighter version of their VaporSpan suspension).</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>As I told in the video, the first backpack I ever bought from my own money was a Gregory (Model Weekender, some 60+ l if I remember correctly, in green and black) way back in 1999. I used this pack for 11 years, backpacking in Central America (I lived in Honduras for one year as I was 18/ 19), hiking in Finland, and for lots of travelling. That pack was bombproof and if I wouldn‚Äôt have lost it in an accident I still might be using it. Also the Optic 48 inspires the same durability, it‚Äôs made from a 100D High Tenacity Nylon in the main body and a 210D High Tenacity Nylon in the bottom, with a 7001 Hollow Aluminium Frame and the hipbelt and shoulder straps use a Multi-Density - Lifespan EVA for cushioning. I have no doubt that you could thru-hike several long trails with this pack and it wouldn‚Äôt look worse than on the first day on the trail!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44199753085/in/dateposted/" title="Whoop whoop!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1971/44199753085_7c07579527_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Whoop whoop!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The main pack with all straps and the lid pocket weighs 1181 g in back length L, the lid flap weighs 34 g and the rain cover 90 g. I haven‚Äôt weigh the lid but if you don‚Äôt need the extra storage + organizational space it gives you I imagine you can save another 150 g or so. I also think that by cutting down the straps to my length I could save a maybe another 30 or so grams. This puts the Optic 48 in the lightweight backpack category for me.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I‚Äôll base my assessment of the pack mostly on my 90 km hike in V√•l√•dalen, as that was when I carried a lot of gear with the pack for four days. I have used the pack on day hikes, though as I then carry usually not a lot of weight I find that not representable. On that backpacking trip in V√•l√•dalen I did some very long days - the longest was 38 km, of which were 21 km off-trail. Yes, on that day I really felt the pack and got quite familiar with it, and as you can imagine I was happy when I found around 22:00 clock in the beam of my headlamp a good spot to pitch the tent and lay down.</p>

<p>OK, so the pack. I really like the very stretchy mesh side and front pocket, especially the front pocket can take a lot of gear - first I carried my hardshell pants and jacket in them, then later on the flysheet of the tent and the rubbish (empty packaging from meals and snacks). Also the side pockets are really big, I carried in one both my tripod and the Gorillapod, and in the other one my 1l BeFree Bottle and my Kuksa cup. The side pockets I also can access with the pack on my back, which is good when I want to have my cup to drink from a stream. The hipbelt pockets are also very well designed, they open &amp; close easily with one hand and are big enough for several snacks each.</p>

<p>The Optic 48 is easy to pack, I can stow my UL kit with plenty of room to spare for food and camera gear in it. I have not used the raincover ever, for me this is unnecessary and even hiking in the rain and strong wind the gear stayed dry in it. The top of the pack is really easy to open and close, if you have a lot of kit with you you could strap some of it on top, affix it with the strap and lid, and be good to go. At the front I had my trekking poles attached, which worked OK - the baskets on my poles are small and tended to slip through the loop at the bottom, but the adjustable strap at the top kept them securely in place. If your trekking poles have larger baskets than mine, you‚Äôre fine! I really haven‚Äôt used the side compression straps or the possibility to strap something underneath the pack, but it‚Äôs good to know they‚Äôre there.</p>

<p>The harness, shoulder straps and ventilated back work well together, especially the harness and straps are very comfortable and carry well, though I do wish the shoulder straps would be a bit more apart at the top, which should make them even more comfortable. As I left the V√•l√•dalen Fj√§llstation I was carrying 17 kg of weight (that is including food for four days, 1 l of water and an unreasonable amount of camera gear). Yes, the pack felt heavy, but not uncomfortable. Once the straps were correctly adjusted the weight was transferred nicely to the hipbelt and shoulders, and even when I was boulder hopping I never felt unsafe or burdened. Generally I don‚Äôt see much use in ventilated back panels, maybe it is because I either way sweat a lot, I am not hiking in 30¬∞C or more temperatures or something else, I don‚Äôt know. The idea certainly is good, I just don‚Äôt know if they work.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>While the shoulder straps do work for me, I think they could be made even better by making them wider at the top where they connect to the pack. As they are the straps are rather close together, which can be uncomfortable for some people. I also would like if the shoulder straps would be slightly more narrow so that it would be easier to connect my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/10/gear-of-the-year-2015-peak-design-capture-pro-camera-clip.html">Peak Design Capture Clip V3</a> to it, right now it is a rather tight fit. And if a future Gregory lightweight pack gets rid of the ventilated back and puts the shoulder straps further apart I think they could have a really amazing pack!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44199763275/in/dateposted/" title="The Shoulder Straps"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1950/44199763275_9943a38b67_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Shoulder Straps" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I am very happy with how the Optic 48 has carried a rather heavy load in Sweden, kept the gear inside dry and was comfortable also on very long &amp; strenuous days. It is a lightweight pack which is best suited to people who carry heavier loads (for example who go out backpacking to take photos and carry a tripod, heavy lenses and accessories, in addition to the camping kit) and those who want a backpack which will last them a long time, no matter how careless they treat the pack when they are out. With its easily accessible side and hipbelt pockets you don‚Äôt need to take the pack off when you want to eat or drink something, and the lid with its two zippered pockets offers a good place to store smaller items like your phone, keys, wallet, spare batteries and the map + notebook. The well cushioned shoulder straps and hipbelt feel great and are a nice change to thinner UL carrying systems. In conclusion, I‚Äôm looking forward to take the Optic out again in the future on long hikes where I carry heavier loads - and everyone who does not carry 5 kg of camera gear likely will really enjoy this backpack on their wilderness hikes!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you want to spend an active week of holidays in Scandinavia, √Öre is the place to go: Kayaking, trailrunning, hiking, kite surfing and downhill biking are just some of the activities you can do in this wonderful little village in Western Sweden. In the autumn the village is especially pretty, as the hills with their bilberry shrubs turn red and the birches add their golden leafs for that wonderful relaxing autumn feel!</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-re-sweden">Getting to √Öre, Sweden</h2>

<p>As sustainability grows more and more important to me I find it harder and harder to book a flight. While you can fly to √Öre I have a <a href="https://www.wasaline.com">ferry</a> in my town, that allows me to be very quickly in Ume√•, Sweden. From there I can hop on a <a href="https://www.sj.se">train</a> and be in six hours in √Öre, arriving right in the centre of the village. This is a very affordable and relaxing way to travel for me, as I can watch my favourite Youtube channels, read books, plot down ideas for articles and of course study the map for my upcoming backpacking trip in V√•l√•dalen! From Finland you can also leave from Helsinki and Turku with the <a href="https://www.tallinksilja.fi">ferry to Stockholm</a>, and then take the sleeper train to √Öre - allowing you to arrive well-rested in the morning and start your day in the active outdoor capital of Sweden!</p>

<h2 id="learning-downhill-biking-at-scandinavias-largest-bike-park">Learning Downhill Biking at Scandinavia‚Äôs largest Bike Park</h2>

<p>‚Äú<em>Are you Hendrik?</em>‚Äù my Guide Jesper asked me when I entered the Skistar Shop on the Main-square of √Öre. ‚ÄúYes, and I‚Äôm here to learn downhill biking. And I‚Äôm afraid.‚Äù ‚Äú<em>That‚Äôs good!</em>‚Äù Jesper replied, and from then on I knew I was in good hands. Odin helped me get dressed in my ‚Äúfull-body harness‚Äù as I referred to it, a combination of a chest and back protector, hand and elbow protectors, shin and knee protectors and of course a helmet and googles. ‚Äú<em>Have you ever sat on a Full-Suspension Bike?</em>‚Äù Jesper asked me when I was dressed. ‚ÄúNo‚Äù I replied. ‚Äú<em>No Problem, I‚Äôll teach you everything there is to know about Downhill biking, from braking, getting up the mountain with the lift and safely getting down!</em>‚Äù</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/45002158152/in/dateposted/" title="Downhill Bikes are fun!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1966/45002158152_acf8fcdc3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Downhill Bikes are fun!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äú<em>Have you ever sat on a Full-Suspension Bike?</em>‚Äù Jesper asked me when I was dressed. ‚ÄúNo‚Äù I replied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After I got my full-suspension bike we headed out and up towards the lift, where we stopped on a flat space and Jesper gave me the instructions I needed to get down the mountain, from the position of my feet (parallel to the ground), how to brake (with both brakes at the same time) and where to look while riding (as far ahead as possible). Then I needed to demonstrate what I was just told, and after a couple of circles Jesper decided I was ready to hit the tracks. A short instruction on how to put the bike into the chair lift followed, though attentive staff also was on hand and ready to help in case I‚Äôd mess up (I didn‚Äôt üòä).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/45002083102/in/dateposted/" title="Jesper enjoying the ride up"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1907/45002083102_82f5175d93_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Jesper enjoying the ride up" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>On the top of the hill it was just as easy to get the bike out and walk away, and then we were ready to drop in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still afraid‚Äù I mentioned to Jesper, upon seeing the tracks and how &amp; with what speed other bikers where racing them down. ‚Äú<em>You‚Äôll be fine. We take this slow, just brake a little all the time and you‚Äôll just do what we talked about earlier.</em>‚Äù Jesper calmed me down, and to make it a wee bit easier we also skipped the first part of the track on this first run, and went in a wee bit further down the hill.</p>

<p>Well, it went really just as fine as Jesper said. Maybe my experience of riding bike every day, bikepacking and riding on local trails had given me a good foundation and idea on how to ride downhill, but soon I was whooping as I took a curve high and fast or racing over the narrow trails. Yes, I was braking and definitely not as fast and good as many others riding in <a href="https://aresweden.com/en/are-bike-park/">√Öre Bike Park</a>, but damn did it feel good to turn that fear into confidence, joy and hollers as I was riding down √Öreskutan!</p>

<p>That first day we were two and half hours out in the Bike Park, and I not only got to see the best view over √Öre, but I also got to ride many different trails - from the Beginner-friendly Serpentinen to the gorgeously scenic Organic. I really was overjoyed about the experience, and even if I didn‚Äôt master the jumps very well (taking off to early, with too much speed or not landing right) it was an amazing afternoon!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31177203358/in/dateposted/" title="Taking the curve"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1970/31177203358_6a4b0d156e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Taking the curve" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The next day - because all good things come in pairs! - I headed back in the morning to the Ski Star Shop, and with some luck &amp; good timing Jesper and me were the first people on the lift up. There‚Äôs several chair lifts which bring bikers up the mountain, as well as the cable car, though sadly it was too windy and so the latter was grounded. That meant we wouldn‚Äôt be able to ride from the top as Jesper had planned, but he had some great trails for me to ride nevertheless. I asked if it‚Äôd be OK to ride down Serpentinen again as the first ride, so I can ‚Äú<em>get back into the groove on familiar terrain</em>‚Äù and that was just what Jesper had planned.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31177213698/in/dateposted/" title="√Öre Bike Park and √Öresj√∂n"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1970/31177213698_ecf52e3eb1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="√Öre Bike Park and √Öresj√∂n" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then we took another lift up, rode to the other side of the mountain and enjoyed another scenic trail which brought us back down to √Öre. Back up Jesper decided I was ready to ride Shimano, √Öre‚Äôs most famous red trail. Shortly my fear flickered back up, but with some confidence inspiring words from Jesper I dropped in. Shimano has some 50 or so jumps (and I rolled over at least 40 or so of them üò¨ü§£) and 20 fat bank curves where you almost ride parallel to the ground, and it‚Äôs a trail which had me hollering quite a bit when I mastered a curve or a jump! After Shimano we had a small Fika in town, and then hit the trails a few more times before it was time for me drop off my gear and bike, say many thank yous to Jesper and leave the shop with a big, fat smile!</p>

<p>Downhill biking thus. It is strangely relaxing to ride down that narrow trail, always looking far ahead, not going too slow so you can take that curve as high as possible, and also trying to taking in that amazing scenery. You life in the present, things which you had on your mind while walking to the lift - remember that fear from the beginning? - are pushed aside, to be pondered about at another time, if ever again. The focus is on the trail in front of you, and when you arrive down at the lift station - a big smile and the excitement of that adrenaline rush leaving your brain. It‚Äôs addicting, and after years of wondering what people find in this ‚Äúdangerous sport‚Äù, I know: Focus, relaxation and joy.</p>

<p>(<em>And while I feel that I already have enough hobbies, I think I need to etch out some time to go more downhill biking. And maybe I need to visit the <a href="http://arebikefestival.com">√Öre Bike Festival</a> in 2019!</em>)</p>

<h2 id="trailrunning-to-totthummeln">Trailrunning to Totthummeln</h2>

<p>Since the summer I am <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning</a> several times a week at home. Now, as some of you know, I life at the coast in Finland. Unlike, for example, the Norwegian coast, the Finnish coast is pretty similar to the Dutch coast. Which means it‚Äôs prettttttty flat over here. And while I run up and down several ‚Äúhills‚Äù every week, these 15, 20 m of elevation did not really make me ready to run in the mountains. That‚Äôs the realization I came to when I was running with Bj√∂rn up to Totthummeln, a scenic hill with a great view which lays between √Öre and Bj√∂rnen. We started from Granen, the Hotel I stayed at, and after a few hundred meters of asphalt we soon hit the Trollstigen Trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44138672535/in/dateposted/" title="Trailrunning on Totthummeln"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1909/44138672535_55bcb74c1a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Trailrunning on Totthummeln" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44138673125/in/dateposted/" title="Trailrunning on Totthummeln"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1943/44138673125_1259752daf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Trailrunning on Totthummeln" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31177183928/in/dateposted/" title="Totthummeln Summit View"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1902/31177183928_7d2857d49b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Totthummeln Summit View" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>From then on it were sweet trails that took us around the mountain, with great views over √Öre, the lake and Bj√∂rnen, and then up to the top of Totthummeln. Bj√∂rn‚Äôs personal best time around the mountain is 35 minutes, though with my help and the visit to the summit we made it in double the time back to my Hotel‚Ä¶ Nevertheless, it was a great run, despite the rain, and if you don‚Äôt want to run to this easy summit - you always can make it a nice day hike with the family &amp; kids!</p>

<h2 id="hiking-on-reskutan">Hiking on √Öreskutan</h2>

<p>Before trailrunning with Bj√∂rn I was out on my own in the morning, exploring the hiking trails of √Öreskutan. There are over half a dozen trails which go up, around and across the mountain, and if you‚Äôre looking for a fun day hike - √Öreskutan will not disappoint. Yes, you will cross the ski slopes once in a while, but most of the time you‚Äôll be hiking in pretty forests on nice trails. There‚Äôs Caf√©s where you can enjoy a warm cup of coffee and a Kanelbullar, and if you don‚Äôt want to hike down you always can take one of the lifts back to the village. If the weather is good I can imagine that the hiking is very nice, and especially the Trollstigen Trail with it‚Äôs hidden treasures and wood nymphs is great for kids (it‚Äôs also only about a kilometre long, so also doable for 3 year olds!).</p>

<h2 id="exploring-the-village">Exploring the village</h2>

<p>After all that hiking, running and cycling I was hungry. Already before I left to √Öre I heard about the <a href="http://www.creperielogi.se/are/">√Öre Cr√™perie &amp; logi</a>, and the place did not disappoint! It was very cozy with super-friendly staff, and the Vegan Cr√™pes were amazing &amp; soooooo tasty. I also went and had coffee at the <a href="http://arekafferosteri.se/">√Öre Kafferosteri</a> which roast their own coffee - definitely a recommndation. As a Houdini Friend I also of course had to check out the <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/se/vara-butiker?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzMDAhcXn3QIV7p3tCh2bEAokEAAYASAAEgK1s_D_BwE">Houdini Store √Öre</a>, though I also went to see the Shops of Peak Performance (which was founded in √Öre in 1986!), Stellar Equipment and Hagl√∂fs! Besides these stores you‚Äôll find a couple other sports stores, and plenty of Caf√©s and Bars to spend the afternoons and evenings.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-stay">Where to stay</h2>

<p>There‚Äôs over <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=-2468311&amp;aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">30 Hotels and B&amp;Bs in √Öre</a>, so there‚Äôs something for each wallet. I stayed my first two nights at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/se/hotell-granen.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Hotell Granen</a> which is a wee bit up the hill and offered a scenic view. The Hotel had an amazing breakfast, was super-beautifully decorated (I would have wished I‚Äôd had more time to just lounge in the comfy chairs by the fire place and read or drink a ü•É in the bar) and not even three minutes on foot and one was in the centre of √Öre!</p>

<p>My last night in √Öre I slept and dined at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/se/holiday-club-are.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Holiday Club √Öre</a> which was equally impressive. This is a Holiday Club Hotel unlike any other I have seen - it‚Äôs modern, stylish and in the middle of town -  you get to the railway station via a bridge! The Holiday Club √Öre has a Spa and Swimming Pool, and also is a popular Lunch place for the locals. I had twice a very delicious lunch here, and the Vegan 3-Course dinner was outstanding and so much that I couldn‚Äôt even finish my dessert! The room was very nice, I was sitting on the terrace in the sun and enjoying the view over the lake and town and a bit sad I had to leave so soon again.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping it up</h2>

<p>A holiday in √Öre can be many things: Exciting, relaxing, and tasty. I so much enjoyed my days in this small ski town, which unlike many other ski towns in the Alps or Northern Europe is open year-round. That‚Äôs right - √Öre‚Äôs shops &amp; hotels are open almost the whole year, and the <a href="https://www.skistar.com/en/ski-destinations/are/">cable cars and lifts</a> run in the winter, spring, summer and autumn: In the winter they bring skiers and snowboarders up the slopes, while from spring till autumn it are hikers and downhill bikers who take a ride up to √Öreskutan. Add in its proximity to several beautiful nature places like V√•l√•dalen and just a short trip to Norway, and like me, you probably soon will fall in love with the authentic vibe of this small town &amp; its friendly people and you‚Äôll wonder: When can I come back?</p>

<p><em>PS: √Öre hosts the <a href="http://are2019.com">FIS Alpine World Ski Championships</a> in February 2019, if you‚Äôre interested in these kind of things - check out the linked website and <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=-2468311&amp;aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">book a room right away</a></em>!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Poor sleep is something many of us, including me, have problems with. As the stress &amp; problems of daily life mount up, we watch till late at night on our iPhones things which have zero relevance, and we generally stay up too late - because finally the kids are in bed and we want that me-time. The bill for this comes the next morning when the alarm rings early and you have a hard time to get out of the bed and start your day. If you suffer regularly from a bad sleep at home, it‚Äôs time to detox and put your bed up outdoors.</p>

<p>Research from leading Universities across the globe has shown that the modern human that you and me are sleeps up to two hours too little each night. That not only has the immediate effect of feeling tired or sleepy in the morning, but in the long-run your general health will be deteriorating and you‚Äôre opening up the door to sicknesses like cancer, type-2 diabetes and heart diseases, amongst others. Much of this has to do with where we life: In our cities and homes we are no longer in touch with the natural light-dark cycle of nature - especially in big cities it can feel like it‚Äôs ‚Äúlight‚Äù outside all the time. Sitting with a tablet in hand on the sofa or watching ‚Äújust one more Episode‚Äù of Game of Thrones doesn‚Äôt help much either to get at a good time into bed.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúThe ramifications of insufficient sleep are quickly felt: Studies show that just one night without proper rest quadruples your risk of catching a cold.‚Äù</p>

<p>So while it might sound counter-intuitive for the city dweller to go outside to sleep well (‚ÄúWhat about the bears and spiders?‚Äù) the reality is that after some activity in the mountains &amp; forests and the fresh air you are bound to have a good night‚Äôs sleep. Especially since there should not be any lights, tablets and TV Shows keeping you awake. With this article I want to encourage you to go sleep outside in nature if you suffer from poor sleep at home, and what follows are my tips from over a dozen years of experience of sleeping outdoors.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-go-sleep-outside">When to go sleep outside</h2>

<p>No, you don‚Äôt need to go to sleep when the sun goes down and wake up when it nips back up over the horizon the next morning. Depending on the time of the year I like to be at my camping spot between 18 and 19 o‚Äôclock in the evening, have the tent and bed set up while it is still light and then have dinner. If it‚Äôs possible I like to also sit around the campfire and drink a hot chocolate, not only is watching the fire so relaxing, that hot chocolate also will keep you warm at night. I need my 8 hours of sleep a night, but just like people are not the same also the sleep needs of every person is different - some can manage with 6 hours a night, others need their 9 hours to feel good the next day. There‚Äôs no right or wrong when sleeping outside (or inside, for that matter) - when I feel tired, which outdoors is usually around 22 o‚Äôclock, I go brush my teeth, have that final pee (because I don‚Äôt like to get up &amp; out in the middle of the night!) and snug up in my quilt. I often have an Alarm set for the next day, but the reality is that I am awake around sunrise and then just nap till I feel like I want to get up. This is especially amazing if I don‚Äôt have a schedule to adhere to or have to be somewhere at a certain time. I potter around in the mornings, packing up while having breakfast, and slowly getting ready for another day of hiking.</p>

<h2 id="keep-that-phone-off">Keep that phone off</h2>

<p>If you sleep bad at home the reason could be the phone, computer or tablet which you‚Äôre starring at on the sofa. So the Number #1 Rule when going to sleep outside is to keep the phone off. Yes, it‚Äôs tempting to upload a photo on Instagram, check the Twitter feed or something else meaningless which you can do on Social Media. From my own experience of sleeping outside for the past 20 years I can only recommend to not use the phone in the evenings. Keep it in Airplane mode, but keep it away and don‚Äôt watch on that tiny screen while you‚Äôre out in nature. Chances are you could see the Northern Lights in the sky instead, or watch the millions of stars which illuminate the night sky and which you can not see in the city.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29842882657/in/dateposted/" title="Put the phone off!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1870/29842882657_dfd7ff5769_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Put the phone off!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sleep-next-to-a-creek">Sleep next to a creek!</h2>

<p>Sleeping next to a creek or river - for some a sure way that they feel like they need to pee all the time, for others the most relaxing sound to fall asleep to. I really like to camp next to rivers and always try to have one close by - on my recent backpacking trip in V√•l√•dalen I slept every night next to a river, and it was glorious. An advantage of sleeping close to that relaxing sound of water rushing over rocks and pebbles is that water for brushing your teeth, cooking and coffee is never far away - and if you want to kick-start the next morning, a quick dip in the river will have you wide awake in no time! (<em>Bonus Advantage of sleeping next to a noisy creek: You don‚Äôt hear the bear and reindeer walking through your camp at night!</em>) üêª ü¶å</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/43869660855/in/dateposted/" title="Camp next to a creek!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1889/43869660855_b254510550_b.jpg" width="1024" height="767" alt="Camp next to a creek!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="afraid-of-the-dark">Afraid of the dark?</h2>

<p>Fear of the dark is something we learn from our parents and society. Homo Sapiens, you and me, we are the top of the food chain and pretty much every predator in our natural environments will make a wide path around us whenever they see or smell us. Wolfes, Wolverine, Lynx and Bears - they will not seek you out at night in your tent to come snack on you. Now Mosquitos, that‚Äôs a different story. But: You can learn again to not be afraid of the dark. An evening stroll in the park or forest can be a good way to start this, and it might take a few times sleeping outside to feel comfortable and not afraid - though soon you will realize that the dark forest or mountains hold no danger, and you can go to sleep safely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúLong term, regularly shaving an hour or more off your required sleep increases your risk of certain cancers, diabetes, Alzheimer‚Äôs, obesity, cognitive decline, depression and heart disease.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="good-gear-for-a-good-nights-sleep">Good gear for a good nights sleep</h2>

<p>I think MicroAdventures are a good way to start getting used to sleeping outside. Even better is it to take a friend or two along - just make sure they don‚Äôt snore! These can be squeezed in during the work week - take the bike or train to the hills after work, hike to your sleeping place, roll out the bivy bag, get some water for tea and dinner boiling, and then watch how the stars are coming out. Gear-wise there seriously isn‚Äôt much needed for a good night outdoors: A sleeping pad, a quilt or sleeping bag, maybe a tent or bivy, and possibly a pillow. All of that fits into a 20 l backpack, including some dinner &amp; breakfast, a light stove and a water bottle. I would recommend that if you head out fot the first time to sleep outside to loan the gear from a friend or online, and if it feels like you enjoy sleeping outside and the activity of hiking &amp; backpacking, then invest in the best gear you can afford! Here‚Äôs my recommendations for comfortable &amp; warm gear for sleeping outside:</p>

<p>A sleeping pad is the mattress of your outdoor bed, and super important. I recommend a thick and insulated pad like the <a href="http://bit.ly/2PNrEi4">Therm-A-Rest XLite</a> or <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/therm-a-rest-neoair-xtherm-sleeping-pad/?pid=10239">Therm-A-Rest XTherm</a> if you easily feel cold as the base of your bed. Cover yourself up with a quilt as it gives you more freedom of movement - just like your blanket at home. A synthetic quilt like the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/as-tucas-sestrals-quilt.html">As Tucas Sestrals quilt</a> is less sensitive against moisture, while a down quilt like the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/01/katabatic-gear-sawatch-quilt.html">Katabatic Gear Sawatch</a> is a bit lighter and warmer still. I don‚Äôt use a pillow anymore, but just roll up my <a href="http://bit.ly/2KZmRr9">Patagonia Nano-Air Light Hoody</a> which I wear during the day and which makes for a comfortable pillow.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42251990132/in/album-72157669299782358/" title="Side view"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/978/42251990132_73498f30bd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Side view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If you prefer a bivy or a tent depends on how much ‚Äúhouse‚Äù you want to have around you. A <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/millaris-bivy-sack/">bivy</a> lets you see the stars on a clear night, while a <a href="http://bit.ly/2PO4mIK">tent</a> gives more protection when it rains and is windy. All of this and some more fits into the <a href="http://bit.ly/2PM5xss">ULA Photon</a> or the <a href="http://bit.ly/2xnqdQx">Hyperlite Mountain Gear Porter</a> backpacks, with room for a <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/msr-windburner-10-l-personal-stove-system-stove-system/?pid=10239">stove</a> and more. Finally, on long backpacking trips I carry an extra pair of woolen socks, a dry pair of <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/icebreaker-anatomica-boxers-merino-base-layers-bf/?pid=10239">boxer shorts</a> and a 2nd <a href="https://www.houdinisportswear.com/en/men/baselayers/ms-activist-tee-f18">Houdini Activist Message T-Shirt</a> and the amazing <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/en/men/pants/ms-lodge-pants">Houdini Lodge Pants</a> for sleeping in.</p>

<h2 id="good-night">Good night!</h2>

<p>So, if you woke up tired and sleepy this or last morning, and you feel you need too much coffee to go through the day - consider sleeping outside. Together with a switched off phone and no electronic devices and a creek which runs by your comfortable and warm bed in nature you‚Äôre bound to have a healthy sleep (just don‚Äôt stay up watching for Northern Lights too long!). While one night outdoors is great to get a healthy dose of sleep, I feel after three or more nights one really starts to sleep much better in nature - so after your first couple of Microadventures, why not plan for a long weekend of sleeping in the hills or forests? <strong>Leave a comment</strong> if you slept outside this week, or plan to go!</p>
