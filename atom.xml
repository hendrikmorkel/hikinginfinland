<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Lighter than the <a href="http://eoe-europe.com/de/kocher/27-apert.html">EOE Apert stove</a> and the Kyll Ti pot stand is only going stoveless. And while stoveless makes cooking on the trail easier, missing out on coffee or tea with breakfast, a warm dinner and a hot chocolate in the evening certainly is a big sacrifice. A sacrifice which isn’t necessary with a light alcohol stove like the Apert. The Kyll Ti pot stand folds flat down when not needed and also works with MYOG stoves or Esbit, and of course especially well with the Apert stove which boils water very fast. Together these two are so light they give you a very good reason to carry a stove with you on your next hike!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>I tried the Hammock and while it is very comfortable maybe I’m more of a Ground Dweller after all. I do prefer a nice, simple shelter to be honest - something like the <a href="https://backpackinglight.dk/tents/one-person-tent/six-moon-designs-lunar-solo-le-massive-one-man-tent">Six Moon Designs Lunar Solo</a> ticks really all the boxes for me. It’s light at 680 g, pitches easily with just one pole and there’s plenty of space for one person and kit in the Lunar Solo. It has great ventilation but you also can sit out a storm in it - and thanks to the bathtub floor you don’t even get wet! Once you hit the trail again the Lunar Solo packs away nice &amp; small, ready to be pitched again at your next camp spot!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>backpacking in the jungle is beautiful - but if you plan to sleep on the ground you better be sure there’s no insects which make short work of your gear! It is much better to hang up a hammock and sleep off the ground, and with the <a href="https://eu.hennessyhammock.com/products/deep-jungle-asym-zip-xl">Deep Jungle Asym Zip XL</a> from Hennessy Hammock you can do so in comfort and be protected from the elements, too. The Deep Jungle Hammock is a double bottom hammock with two layers of tightly woven high tenacity rip stop nylon and can accommodate a mattress between them, so that you don’t get a cold back when you’re hanging between two trees in the mountains! The rainfly in the shape of a parallelogram keeps you dry when the monsoon storms hit the forest, and packed together it’s still light enough to not slow you down when you’re hiking through the dense undergrowth of the jungle.</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>also two years later a packrafter’s nightmare is still carrying a PFD on long trips. Because traditional foam PFDs are very bulky they’re not nice to carry, and sitting in a packraft with them isn’t the most comfortable thing either. Enter the <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Safety/Anfibio-Buoy-Boy::499.html">Anfibio Buoy Boy</a>, an inflatable vest that gives you buoyancy when you’re packrafting on lakes and rivers, and while you’re hiking it packs to the sizes of a 1 l bottle and weighs a mere 350 g!

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>what does every outdoor enthusiast need, besides a backpack, pants, quilt and a tent? Food! Good food for outdoor pursuits is something that packs a high calorie to weight ratio, but that ain’t everything - it also should taste good and give you the energy you need after a long day of climbing, trailrunning or skiing. <a href="http://isostar.se">Isostar</a> offers many different options to keep you powered outdoors, from Energy Bars and Gels to Sports and Protein Drinks. With a full set of these, as well as a bottle, one easily could run a marathon - or some nice long walks in the Finnish Fjells, which celebrate 100 years of Independence today!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>what does every outdoor enthusiast need? Right: Pants. The <a href="http://www.lundhags.com/Products/Clothing/Pants/Stretch-Hybrid-Pants/Makke-Pant/(color)/290#info">Makke Pants</a> from Lundhags is exactly such a pants - they are light, has pre-shaped knees for freedom of movement and ventilation openings to stay cool, enough pockets to store the map &amp; compass and looks really great, too! Made from Lundhags PolyCotton Stretch material with Schoeller Dry Skin stretch panels on the seat it is durable and sheds light rain but is stretchy enough to allow for scrambles in the hills. Add a thin Merino baselayer under it and you even can wear it during mild winter hikes!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>December used to be the time that Finland and Scandinavia were covered from South to North under a blanket of snow, with temperatures under 0°C. Nowadays we’re lucky if it snows at all.</p>

<p>I very well remember my first winter in Finland. That was 2002, and I arrived with my dad and brother in Jyväskylä, and it was cold. The streets and sidewalks were hidden under a solid cover of snow and ice, and everywhere around town huge mountains of snow were piling up. The lakes were frozen solid, often up to a meter thick, and it was save and fun to go walk or skate on them. My first New Year in Finland I celebrated with a whopping -35°C - it was terribly cold and I was happy to return inside and have a hot Glögi!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27052335169/in/dateposted/" title="Sunrise on Paha-Koli"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4578/27052335169_ca5cbe4e24_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunrise on Paha-Koli" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But with every year that I lived in Finland I grew more fond of cold temperatures, snow and ice. I experienced some ridiculously beautiful winters here in the North, learned that taking a poop at -36°C outside is possible (but something I like to do very quickly indeed!) and when it is save to move across the frozen Baltic and when it’s better to stay on land.</p>

<p>Then almost five years ago we moved with our little family to the sunniest city of Finland, and in 2013 <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/last-day-of-winter.html">I camped out the last time on the ice</a> here in Vaasa. And while winter still exists in Finland, it’s seldom seen south of Oulu nowadays. Climate change is to blame, and Finland is one of the prime countries in the world to experience the warming globe. While we don’t drown over here, our winters become warmer and our summers most certainly can not be called that with the cold temperatures and rain they include. This all started in 2014, when the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/02/the-four-week-winter.html">winter in Vaasa was a mere four weeks long</a>. In 2015 and 2016 they were of equal quality, which is to say they were crap. Fondly I remember the times that I put on my XC skis in front of my door in Tampere or Vaasa and went skiing on the lake or in the forest - but in the last three years I haven’t even bothered to take them out of their storage bag.</p>

<p>If you want to experience winter in Finland you nowadays need to travel to the far North: <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/04/hetta-winter-adventures-in-finnish-lapland.html">Hetta</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/11/winter-fun-in-ruka.html">Ruka</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/winter-family-adventures-in-pyha-luosto.html">Pyhä</a> or Vuokatti is where we went in the last years and where we really enjoyed the snow and cold weather.</p>

<p>But the paradox of this is that most people who travel North to experience the glorious snow are part of the problem: Arriving by plane or in an SUV which you drove up from Helsinki means more emissions are blown into the atmosphere, which continues to heat up and slowly fucks up the planet. Sure we want to show our kids and friends what a real winter used to look like, but nowadays you need to travel hundreds of kilometers to get where the snow is.</p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that we can not depend on our governments to keep Climate Change in check. You yourself need to do your part so that we and future generations can continue to experience the joy of making a snow-angel, sledding down a hill and ski-touring in the mountains. The easiest things you can do is to cut out meat of your diet and ditch the car for the bike or public transportation. For (winter) holidays try to stay local or travel by train or bus to your destination, and if you fly across the globe to ski at least be so smart to <a href="https://mossy.earth/collections/carbon-offsetting-travel/products/offset-your-flights">offset your emissions</a>. And generally you should embrace a more minimalistic lifestyle and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/12/the-perfect-outdoor-gift.html">stop giving shitty presents</a>. Finally, you can support organizations like <a href="http://www.protectourwinters.fi">Protect our Winters</a> and <a href="http://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org">1% For The Planet</a> which try their best so that we have winters in the future.</p>

<p>As for me, I hope we will have the first good winter here in Vaasa since 2013. There were already some nice snowy days here this November, but they were followed by +5°C days and rain which, in case you didn’t know, are not very good for snow. But winter is still young, so there is hope =)</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>you know what is more exciting than skiing, hiking and climbing? Right, documenting these pursuits when you are outdoors! Sadly storing and transporting your gear with the leashes and pockets which come with cameras aren’t always the best - if you want those, you will need to stop by at Peak Design. This company from San Fransisco has been designing and manufacturing some of the best accessories for photographers out there, and with their new <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/product/bags/everyday-sling-5/?acc=97">Everyday Sling 5L</a> they now also offer such a compact pouch that it fits my a6500 and some equipment just perfectly! I also prefer to use the <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/product/straps/leash/?acc=97">Leash</a> instead of the camera straps which come with my cameras, as the Leash is easy to take off when not needed (when e.g. using a slider) - or you can add the <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/product/straps/cuff/?acc=97">Cuff</a> if you want to secure your camera to just your hand. This lightweight trio of Everyday Sling, Leash and Cuff is the ideal companion to any small DSLR or M43 Camera, and hence I’d love to add it to my camera kit!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>picture this: You arrive up North for your trip and you realize your quilt isn’t up to the task of keeping you toasty. Staying warm in subzero temperatures isn’t easy, but happily the <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/foratata-quilt/">Foratata Quilt</a> from the Spanish Cottage As Tucas would do just that! Available in three styles and made with the high craftsmanship you know from them, the Foratata uses 900 cuin down to keep one warm when stationary but also packs small when one is moving. It’s a great piece of gear and brand-new - so new, indeed, that it ain’t available until later in December and this is the best chance to get the first Foratata quilt ever!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>picture this: I was just yesterday in Slushy Helsinki, but travelling back north it got colder and whiter the further north we went. As I arrived in Vaasa and walked to my bicycle it was covered under a white blanket and I wished I would have had a warmer jacket with me - something like the <a href="http://www.mountain-equipment.de/moreno-jacket">Moreno Jacket</a> from Mountain Equipment. The Polartec Thermal Pro Fleece has this cuddly look and is just as at home on a trip to the office as it is ice-climbing in Korouoma. Two zippered pockets store the essentials when on the go in town or some snacks when climbing up a frozen waterfall. It’s so versatile in use that I’m even pondering getting the <a href="http://www.mountain-equipment.de/womens-moreno-jacket">female version</a> for my wife because she most certainly would love this warm fleece jacket!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>December is here! What better way to kick things of for the next 24 days than with a backpack? <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/?pid=10239">Alpinetrek.co.uk</a> was so kind to provide one lucky hiker with the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/berghaus-freeflow-30-trekking-backpack/?pid=10239">Berghaus Freeflow 30</a>. At 30 l it packs a lot of gear for a day out in the hills, and the ultralight backpacker will even take the pack outdoor a weekend trip or longer. The back panel is increasing airflow and should be great for sweaty summer hikes, while the included rain cover keeps the contents dry when the weather turns. Stretchy side pockets carry a water bottle while the stretchy front pocket takes in a jacket or other gear. All in all a sweet pack which is great for hillwalking and dayhikes!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>really, 12 months passed and we’re talking again? How are you? Did your pack get lighter this year? How’s the snow up North, and are the reindeers alright? I did miss our conversations, and am looking forward to catch up with you over the next 24 days. But I also need to tell you that this is likely the last time we’ll be having our chats - rumor has it that this is the final #HiFAdventCalendar - that could be just a rumor, or then it’s a fact - I guess we’ll have to wait till November 2018 to find out. Anyway.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/advent-calendar-2017/">2017 Hiking in Finland Advent Calendar</a> looks like it will be the best yet again, with great prizes that will make quite a few people happy. Also, Hiking in Finland is <a href="https://mossy.earth/collections/carbon-offsetting-travel/products/plant-a-tree">planting one tree for each door that goes open</a>, so once the 24th of December comes around there will be 25 trees planted, already a wee forest! That’s not just great for the environment, but also for future generations of outdoor enthusiasts! Well, lets have a look at the prizes this year, shall we?</p>

<p>The ADZHiFACKO Door has some sweet kit from GSI with the <a href="http://www.gsioutdoors.com/halulite-microdualist-complete.html">Halulite Microdualist Complete Set</a> and the <a href="http://www.gsioutdoors.com/ultralight-java-drip.html">Ultralight Java Drip</a>. The Halulite Microdualist is an excellent choice to boil water and cook food when outdoors, and best of all: It’s made for two people and packs up in itself. But even when outdoors on my own the Halulite is a solid choice and with the Ultralight Java Drip a good cup of real coffee is never far away. And who can resist good coffee - especially outdoors?!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://kupilka.fi/en/products/kupilka-37">Kupilka 37</a> goes very well with the stove and coffee dripper, and the 370 ml volume of this new, larger Kuksa is a real benefit: Large cups of coffee in the morning, warm soups in the afternoon, refreshingly cold cups of water while hiking and hot chocolate in the evening can be consumed from it in style.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://mountainlaureldesigns.com/product/event-rain-mitts/">eVent Rain Mitts</a> from Mountain Laurel Design on the other hand are a good weather charm - carry these 30 g mitts and it’s bound not to rain! I can not imagine a better way to influence the weather, and if one’s luck runs out then one can always wear them to keep the hands dry!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://goosefeetgear.com/products/down-socks/">Down Socks</a> from GooseFeet Gear on the other hand are a sure guarantor to toasty toes and feet. They also pack down next to nothing, are ultralight and nowadays come in a variety of colours from Black to Red, Pink and Blue. The Mitts and Socks even pack so small, you could stuff them into your Kuksa!</p>

<p>As you see Dear Santa, this kick-off Door is already filled to the brim with sweet kit - and all potential winners need to do is enter via the Rafflecopter Widget below!</p>

<p>Welcome to the seventh and final Hiking in Finland Advent Calendar! Like in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/advent-calendar-2014/">years</a> <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/advent-calendar-2016/">before</a>, a good set of rules makes running the Advent Calendar a lot easier for all of us. Read them carefully and everything will be clear, and for some added benefit check out the <strong>tips</strong> at the end!</p>

<p>This years calendar will run 25 days (= 25 Doors), and behind each door you will find a fine piece of equipment which should make your next outdoor adventure fun and ultralight. Some information on the prizes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All prizes are sent directly from the company providing them (<strong>which can mean that you might need to pay import duties when it comes from abroad</strong>!).</li>
  <li>Sometimes it is possible that you can choose size, colour and other variables. Where this is the case, it will be mentioned in the text of the Door.</li>
  <li>This means garments can be either female or male, backpacks can be different torso sizes and meals can be vegetarian or with meat.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-rules">The Rules</h2>

<p>To win something you should check in each day here and enter the raffle. There are a couple of points to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>You only can win once.</strong> If you don’t win on one day, you can try your luck the next day - you got 25 chances!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am using a paid-for version of <a href="https://www.rafflecopter.com/">Rafflecopter</a> for the Give-Aways. With Rafflecopter you can get multiple entries by following someone on Instagram, Twitter, visit a page on Facebook, follow a Pinterest page or susbscribe to a Mailing List. This increases your chances to win, but is not mandatory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Rafflecopter Widget is integrated with <a href="http://www.random.org/">Random.org</a> and it choses the winner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>If you are the lucky winner</strong> I contact you via the provided Email address and <strong>you have 24 hours to reply</strong>. If I don’t hear from you, I imagine you don’t want the item and will let Random.org chose a new winner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Posts go online around midnight and the raffles close at midnight - Finnish time. Rafflecopter then will show the name of the winner after I pushed that button, this keeps posts to a minimum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is open to everyone. As in from Amsterdam to Zanzibar, from Canada to South Africa, prices are send everywhere (unless noted otherwise).</p>
  </li>

<h2 id="skiing-in-the-dark">Skiing in the Dark</h2>

<p>Have you ever skied after sunset? And I don’t mean alpine starts skinning up a mountain, but skiing after the sun has set and darkness has fallen across the land? Not? Then welcome to skiing in Finland in the depth of winter!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34026818781/in/album-72157677820371241/" title="Up"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2934/34026818781_6cc2c615ab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Up" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With the sun and it’s light being rare guests between December and February up here in the North you will very likely be skiing at night when you’re visiting. But in case that sounds scary á la <em>“Skiing without seeing anything”</em> you can be assured that you’ll see plenty when you’re hitting the slopes in Ruka in January. The slopes are lit and even if you leave the slope to enjoy a wee bit of powder between the trees you will still see everything. The whole Rukatunturi hill is illuminated as along as the lifts run, and skiing in the light while the world around you is covered in a blanket of black darkness is amazing. David, Nathaniel and me stood several times at the top of the slopes and just being speechless about this experience.</p>

<h2 id="floating-on-an-ice-cold-river">Floating on an ice-cold river</h2>

<p>It’s -10°C and we’re putting on dry suits, all over our winter clothes. Everything except our faces are covered in an orange suit and neoprene. Then it’s a short ride to the river and a walk up to the lake, where the stream starts.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/33315033524/in/album-72157677820371241/" title="Floating"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2812/33315033524_54fe01e4dc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="767" alt="Floating" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Our Guide from <a href="https://www.rukapalvelu.fi/en/activities/winter/floating-in-the-rapids/150-floating-in-the-rapids">Ruka Palvelu</a> gives us some last explanations of what to consider when we’re soon walking into the current which will carry us gently but swiftly down the river. Everything is covered in snow along the shore, and an elk which was drinking from the open river looks full of wonder upon our small group of floating humans. Too quickly we reach the small bay where we need to get out of the river - but happily we have a second float before us! We hike once more up to the lake, walking in till the chest and then just let the buoyancy of the suit carry us down the stream.</p>

<h2 id="ice-climbing">Ice-climbing</h2>

<p>I love <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/ice-climbing-in-korouoma.html">ice climbing</a> and hence was psyched that this activity was on our programme. We went ice climbing with <a href="http://www.outdoorpassion.fi/en/winter/ice-climbing">Outdoor Passion</a> who operate and maintain the Kuru ice wall which is located a ten minutes walk up the slopes from Ruka village. The routes were in good conditions and ranged from beginner to advanced and I had a blast whacking my ice tools into the fine ice, enjoying the good views from further up and of course also seeing that my group enjoyed this activity a lot!</p>

<h2 id="winter-hiking-on-the-karhunkierros">Winter-hiking on the Karhunkierros</h2>

<p>I have hiked several times and in every season on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2009/06/karhunkierros-i.html">Karhunkierros</a>, but experiencing it in winter is always special.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34000243432/in/album-72157677820371241/" title="Tara crossing the river"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2941/34000243432_fac25cd1ce_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tara crossing the river" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This was a short hike to Myllykoski which lays along the Karhunkierros and is one of the most popular (Instagram) places along the trail. The rapids next to the all mill with the hanging bridge across the rapids is impressive, and even in the depth of winter you most likely won’t need snowshoes as there’s a wide trail through the forest to Myllykoski. Once you’re there you could light up a fire and enjoy some coffee and marshmallows by the fire, or continue exploring the area.</p>

<h2 id="the-food">The Food</h2>

<p>Ruka has <a href="http://www.ruka.fi/en/restaurants">variety of Restaurants</a> which means you can try something new each evening during your stay. From cozy slope side Cafés to fine-dining experiences, there’s something for every taste.</p>

<p>We ate at various places while up in the North and instead of me telling you where to go I’d encourage you to go and explore yourself (OK, we had a fantastic lunch at Hotel Cumulus Resort Rukahovi, another tasty lunch Buffet was enjoyed at Restaurant Rukan Kuksa, we drunk local beers at <a href="http://www.hankibaari.fi">Hanki Baari</a> and had a Chef cook for us in the Kota above).</p>

<h2 id="ice-sauna-yoga">(Ice) Sauna (Yoga)</h2>

<p>How do you end a day of adventure in Finland in winter? Right, by relaxing &amp; warming up in a Sauna.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34000298152/in/album-72157677820371241/" title="Sauna"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2883/34000298152_29b00bb66b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sauna" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On our 2nd day in Ruka we went for the <a href="http://wellbeinginwilderness.fi/en/saunatour/">Sauna Tour</a>. It started off with a very nice Sauna Yoga Session. The Sauna was only 50°C warm and we learned simple Yoga poses which helped to release tension from the day.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34000295462/in/album-72157677820371241/" title="Iisakin Sauna"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2917/34000295462_f8b1a40f36_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Iisakin Sauna" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After that we went for a short ride to the <a href="http://wellbeinginwilderness.fi/en/slow-silent/the-ice-sauna-and-healing-peat-sauna/">Ice Sauna</a> which was truly unique and had a very nice löyly (steam). Sitting inside of a building that’s made from ice blocks and having a hot stove warm it up is something to be experienced, and I highly recommend trying it out if you’re in Ruka. After the ice sauna we went into the traditional <a href="http://www.rukansalonki.fi/en/saunas">Smoke Sauna</a> and had a peat mask, again a truly uniquely Finnish experience which is well worth trying. After these Sauna experiences we went for a swim in the ice hole in Lake Salonkijärvi, and had light snacks and plenty of water to stay hydrated.</p>

<h2 id="getting--staying-there">Getting &amp; Staying There</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.finnair.com">Finnair</a> flies from Helsinki to Kuusamo from where you can take the bus to Ruka. Before heading to Ruka we stayed for a night at the <a href="http://www.ikk.fi/en/">Isokenkäisten Klubi</a>, a very nice Hotel which was almost in the middle of nowhere close to the Russian Border. They have a fantastic Smoke Sauna which we enjoyed and great food, so are well worth a visit. There’s also lots of XC skiing and ice fishing around the Hotel, so if you look a more calm stay consider the Isokenkäisten Klubi (it’s not a Club, despite the name =).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34026782451/in/album-72157677820371241/" title="Going home with Finnair"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2927/34026782451_3310af54e7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Going home with Finnair" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/33314944364/in/album-72157677820371241/" title="Morning"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2822/33314944364_5dfe0c90c2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Morning" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In Ruka our group stayed at the <a href="https://www.ski-inn.fi/en/majoitus/ruka">Ruka Ski-Inn</a> and we had a nice room, though I found the breakfast left more to be desired. We checked out the <a href="https://www.cumulus.fi/hotellit/rukatunturi/cumulus-resort-rukahovi-rukatunturi">Cumulus Resort Rukahovi</a> next door and that looked pretty neat - no idea on the breakfast, though we had a very tasty lunch there! There’s <a href="http://www.ruka.fi/en/hotels">six more Hotels in Ruka</a> and you also can <a href="http://www.ruka.fi/en/cottages">rent a cottage</a> or an <a href="http://www.ruka.fi/en/apartments">apartment</a> in the village.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/33346440263/in/album-72157677820371241/" title="Ruka Village Centre"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3956/33346440263_e43d59dbca_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ruka Village Centre" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that a winter vacation in Ruka can be as relaxing or adventurous as you’d like it to be. There’s great accommodation options, delicious food, good local beers and a host of activities of every flavour to make your time in Ruka special. While all we did was a wee bit much in just two days if you spread this out over a week with more skiing - because with over 30 slopes and 20 lifts there’s plenty of skiing for all levels to be enjoyed in Ruka!</p>

<h2 id="hello-sweden">Hello Sweden!</h2>

<p>It’s one o’clock as I cycle over to the ferry harbour in Vaasa, lock my bike and check in. Before me are four hours of ferry boredom but happily it’s much cheaper and more environmentally friendly to take the boat than to fly first to Stockholm and then to Umeå. Besides, Umeå is the closest city to Vaasa if one wouldn’t take the Baltic in account! I spend my time on the boat reading a book on the Kindle App and watching Youtube Videos while drinking coffee and enjoying a tasty Pulla in the Café. Then, finally, we start to see the first islands and it ain’t too long until we arrive at the harbour in Umeå. Usually I’d would have to take a Bus and then another Bus to get where I need to go, but I’m lucky as Elisabeth from the Bjurholm kommun was in town and can give me a ride to Agnäs, where I will spend the first night as a guest of <a href="http://agnasstugby.se">Agnäs Stugor</a>.</p>

<p>I have a own cozy cottage where I roll out my quilt, boil some water and eat one of the meals I brought, along with an Astronaut ice cream - because the sooner that food bag gets lighter and smaller, the better! As I lounge around on the sofa I realize I forgot to bring my Powerbank, which isn’t a smart move - I need it to keep the phone charged as I need it for flying my <a href="http://amzn.to/2hu4iPU">drone</a>. Ah well, I’ll make it work, I think, and then head to sleep after a final hot shower.</p>

<h2 id="rtrsk-to-nsland">Örträsk to Näsland</h2>

<p>It’s a misty morning as my alarm rings at 6:30 am and I get up. I boil hot water in the kitchen for coffee and Müsli, pack up my backpack and then am waiting outside for Claudia, who works for the Bjurholm Community and will drop me off at the start of the trail as she has business in that direction that morning either way. It’s a perk to not needing to stand and wait for a bus up North, which makes the whole logistics part a wee bit easier. I drop off the key to my cottage, say bye to the sheep and then promptly Claudia arrives and we start the ride to Örträsk.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37340950796/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Morning sky"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4401/37340950796_f8e5fa74cc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Morning sky" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The road is very scenic and sometimes I’m almost asking her to stop the car so I could take some photos, but then I re-consider and just let her drive. After some 45 minutes we take a turn and I already see the Öreälven river. A minute later she backs up into a small road and tell’s me <em>“We are here!”</em>. The sky is grey and I much rather would be sitting in a warm car or Café, but hey - lets get started!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37340952986/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Start of the trail"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4482/37340952986_f8d2a6583d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Start of the trail" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37305380575/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Start of the trail!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4441/37305380575_55f457cb81_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Start of the trail!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The sign shows the way, and up here in the Bjurholm community the trail is superbly marked - sometimes every tree has a red or orange dot! I walk two minutes along the gravel road, and that were exactly the two minutes my shoes were dry on the trail: I make a turn down to the river and after six steps through the high grass my shoes are soaking wet.</p>

<p>And then I see the river, and a not that silent <em>DAMN!</em> leaves my mouth: In a last minute decision the previous day I decided to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BY83wAtBy9S/?taken-by=hendrikm">not take my packraft</a>, a decision which I highly regret that moment standing in front of this river. Swiftly it floats past by me, and I picture myself sitting in my packraft and just leisurely floating the river down. Alas, packraft and paddle are at home and I’ll need to use my two feet to get to the Baltic.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37388438031/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Old Flating Dam south of Örträsk"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4466/37388438031_8e13568663_b.jpg" width="1024" height="767" alt="Old Flating Dam south of Örträsk" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A couple of minutes later I arrive at the Floaters Dam, and the small hut besides the river is inviting with it’s beds and table by the window. But as I plan to walk around 30 km each day it’d be a bit pre-mature to call it a day after one kilometre, and so I shoulder my backpack and enter the wild forest along the Öreälv river. And wild it is: The narrow path is never far away from the river, which runs next to me. Sometimes I need to back-track because parts of the trail are so deep under water that I rather look for a dry way around it than trying to jump over it, other times the trail is climbing high up a steep shoulder of a ridge and should one lose the footing one might end up with very wet pants, standing in the river. These sections will not present any problems for an experienced backpacker with a light backpack, though if you haul 20+ kg through the forest on your second or third trip you might feel like you’ve been presented a real challenge.</p>

<p>As it is autumn - <em>PRIME AUTUMN</em>, to be correct - the Mushrooms are in abundance along the trail. Small, big, colourful or inconspicuous, edible and poisonous - there’s so many of them that at some point I gave up to document them all.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37388382211/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="&#x27;Shroom 01"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4421/37388382211_74843c1985_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="&#x27;Shroom 01" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>And then something unexpected happens: The sky clears up and the sun shows up. I rejoice, shed the hardshell and enjoy the golden light finding it’s way through the leaves of the birches whose leafs try to match the colour of the sun. The blue sky appears over me and the green, yellow and orange forest, while the dark river continues to flow never-ending towards the Baltic. <em>“Ah, if I’d just had my packraft along!”</em> is a thought I more than once utter that day. I pass smaller rapids and the most lovely little cottages and simple lean-to shelters. Water for drinking is never far away - just hold the <a href="http://bit.ly/2h29SMs">Katadyn BeFree</a> into the river, screw on the lid and drink!</p>

<p>I hike at a for me slow 3 km/h and at around 17:00 o’clock reach the Näslandsforsen Hut, a lovely cabin with a green roof, not far from the river, plenty of wood and a large sleeping platform. While I planned to sleep at the Mariebäck Hut I decide to stay here, and quickly set up my camp, collect water, carry in wood and clean up the mess others had left before me. As night starts to fall I light the fire, lay on my mat and <a href="https://youtu.be/4jBr_W4iGi4">eat a Trek’N Eat Meal</a>. With a full belly and some 23 km covered it doesn’t take long for me to fall asleep in my warm cabin that night.</p>

<h2 id="nslandsforsen-to-storforsen">Näslandsforsen to Storforsen</h2>

<p>The next morning I wake up before dawn, light a little fire to get the cabin warm and boil the water I got the previous evening. Laying under my Quilt I drink a coffee and eat a Müsli, pondering how to structure my day and where to sleep tonight. As my phone’s battery is still quite good at some 70% full I decide to hike this morning into Bjurholm, have coffee and a Kanelbullar while charging the phone back to 100%. The black &amp; white map I have gives little infos about distance, though I reckon it shouldn’t be more than 8 km to the town.</p>

<p>The morning starts with a blue sky but quickly clouds start to race through the sky. The trail is lovely again, just like the previous day it is very well marked with plenty of trail blazes. Well before 11 o’clock I walk into town and find a Café where I can charge the phone, while studying the map and drinking coffee. After an hour the phone is charged and I set off out of town again. Even if I saw the trail sign I dully ignored it and just hiked down to the river, just to realize after a while that I lost the trail. Happily I found a dirt road which led into the right direction, and after some time of uncertainty I reach the trail again. At Lagnäset there’s a hanging bridge - though sadly it is closed. Claudia from the Bjurhom kummun later told me that there will be a new bridge coming in the future.</p>

<p>I follow the sign and soon hike up a slope which is like a yellow-golden tunnel of Birch-and-Rowan-Awesomeness. I utterly love the colourful forest around me and the kilometres go by just easily. I pass several huts and rest places to which roads lead, but the only person I saw that day was a woman picking berries just outside of Bjurholm. At Petnäset the river makes one of the most beautiful curves, something I tried to capture with my drone, but alas the high wind didn’t allow me to capture the frame I had in mind. Still, the underneath photo should give you an idea of how pretty it is!</p>

<p>The scenery now starts to get more civilized, just as the river. While the day before it ran through deep gorges and I felt at times like I’d be in Lapland or Alaska today the meandering curves and the closeness to fields make it feel closer to civilization. It’s a gradual and nice change, and I enjoy this new scenery. After the Petnäset Hut the river makes lots of curves, and a look on my watch tells me that I already have hiked close to 30 km.</p>

<p>As I’m hiking along the river on along a fine trail at once a small Elk arrives. It stands there, taking a good look at me and lets me take its photo, and then turns back into the forest where I also hear its mother. It’s a beautiful experience and gives me new power to reach Agnäs, which I do by 16 o’clock and after some 35 km. Alas, unless I’d like to stay another night at Agnäs Stugor, Agnäs doesn’t offer much in terms of scenic camp spots.</p>

<p>So onwards it is. I follow a bit of the Klangvägen trail and prompt lose the Öreälvsleden trail, and after some searching I find it again and follow its signs. By now I really feel the distance I have hiked already today, and just wish that I soon arrive at the Storforsen Hut. That, however, doesn’t happen until 18 o’clock and some 42+ km hiked. I drop my gear into the hut, which looks like it’s well visited, and go out and enjoy the spectacular sunset over the Storforsen rapids. After that it’s time for one of the tastiest Meals I have along, <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/real-turmat-chicken-curry-bf/?pid=10239">Chicken Curry from REAL Turmat</a>. I put some logs into the small stove inside and am amazed at how quickly it has heated up the hut - it’s so warm that I soon sit just in my boxer shorts inside, eating my tasty Dinner, looking forward to calling it a night!</p>

<h2 id="storforsen-to-torrble">Storforsen to Torrböle</h2>

<p>The next morning rain is hitting the tin roof and I decide to sleep till 7 am. By the time I get out of my quilt the weather looks better and while the sky is grey it isn’t raining for the time being. I’m surprisingly feeling really good even after the Marathon distance of the previous day, and by 9 o’clock am packed up and hiking again - but before that I explore the Hanging Bridge and the rapids!</p>

<p>Less than four kilometres later I reach the Långholmarna Hut, and this was the last really nice hut along the trail - but this I didn’t know yet. I put down my pack and cleaned my feet in the river here - the water was easier to reach than up at the Storforsen Hut - and am wondering where I will sleep tonight.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/38085031481/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Green &amp; Red"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4452/38085031481_0cafccf233_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Green &amp; Red" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Shortly after the Långholmarna Hut I left the Bjurholm community and entered the Nordmaling community, and the difference was seen quite clearly: While there were well-established sections of trail on the southern part, there were also a lot of sections of trail where one was bush-whacking through chin-high undergrowth, searching for trail blazes and wondering if one was right, and generally the trail was not as well maintained as in the northern part. However, there were also very beautiful parts: High esker ridges which gave wide views across the landscape, colourful forests and pretty places along the river which were very inviting for a break!</p>

<p>I arrived around 16 o’clock at the very nice and new camping place of the tiny village Hummelholm, and just as I was sitting down in the fire shelter the heavens opened and it started to pour down like mad. I was happy that I was lucky enough to sit under a roof that moment, and I observed the rain from the shelter, waiting for it to stop. After 20 minutes the rain passed and I shouldered my pack again, and though I rather would have stayed right there as I already had hiked over 24 km I knew I needed to push on till Torrböle and the Lean-to there. I hiked on the street through Hummelholm and happily left the asphalt road behind at the end of the village. Here the trail was super-well maintained: Trail blazes in regular distances, little benches along the river, bridges and even duck boards over especially swampy sections. The trail released me into a scenic field and I knew that I now was close to my intended camping spot.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37375863944/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Fields"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4512/37375863944_4d714af688_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Fields" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>What I didn’t knew was that the signs for the trail in the tiny village of Torrböle were well hidden, and so I was searching for 45 Minutes for where the trail should continue, until I finally saw the right street and the bridge over the river. However, the confusion of signs and marks on the trees on the other side did cost me another 20 minutes until I finally found the lean-to shelter. Slightly annoyed I pitched the Hapi Sil, got water and built up a fire in the lean-to. I didn’t linger to long around the fire and soon went off to my shelter to catch some sweet dreams.</p>

<h2 id="final-section-to-the-baltic">Final Section to the Baltic</h2>

<p>I had some 25 km left until the end of the trail, and as I needed to still get to Nordmaling to catch a Bus back to Umeå I wanted to be well in time. As the birds started singing I was up, and by 8 o’clock I was back on the trail. Sadly the confusion of which direction to go was still the same as the day before, but after some bullish following of the compass bearing I found the trail. Along several nice rapids for packrafting and fishing I followed the river towards the Baltic, happy to reach it but also sad that my solo hike would soon be over.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long and the trail was following pretty much exclusively forest roads and even asphalt roads. There were some enjoyable sections of nice, narrow forest trails intertwined along the way, but of the 25 km I hiked that day over 20 km were on forest roads and asphalt roads. That made the hiking not very nice - I very much prefer soft forest paths or mountain trails for moving in nature. It was thus quite nice to finally reach the end of the trail in Alvik. I could see the Baltic in the distance, and after having hiked so many kilometres on roads my feet were hurting. I had luck, though - Claudia and her family were picking berries close by and would pick me up and give me a ride to the Bus and Railway Station in Nordmaling! So I got out of my shoes and enjoyed the feeling of gravel and grass, while looking on the river Öreälv and how it now slowly was reaching the end of its journey, a journey which I now had accompanied for 124 km from Örträsk till here!</p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that I highly recommend the Öreälvsleden trail. I enjoyed the wilderness of the northern part which is just a couple of hours away from Umeå, which makes it very easily accessible. I want to visit the trail again - and take my packraft this time! Hence I would recommend if you’d like to visit the trail to take a packraft and hike from around the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/B8dYU3S7eQ42">Tallbergsbroarna</a> North to Örträsk and then paddle back down - that way one can explore the best part of the Öreälvsleden Trail and one avoids the not so nice hiking on forest roads. If you’re into (fly) fishing you also should take a rod with you, as there’s lot of places along the river where you can try your luck. You can even order a permit via your cellphone!</p>

<p>Finally, make sure to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/sets/72157688561043576">check out the Flickr Album</a> with over 150 photos from along the trail to get an even better impression of it.</p>

<h2 id="getting-there-food--accommodation">Getting There, Food &amp; Accommodation</h2>

<p>To get to the start of the trail you’ll first need to <a href="https://www.visitumea.se/en/travel-to-umea">get to Umeå</a> - if you’re coming from Finland hop on the <a href="https://www.wasaline.com/en/">Wasaline Ferry</a> like me and enjoy the scenary on deck when the weather is good. From Umeå you can take either a Bus to Bjurholm or Agnäs to spend a night indoors before you hit the trail, or head directly to Örträsk and camp at the lake or at the Floaters Dam. <a href="https://reseplanerare.resrobot.se/index.html">Resrobot</a> helps you plan the trip with public transportation to the start of the trail and back to Umeå when you have reached the Baltic.</p>

<p>In Umeå I slept at the YMCA Hostel which I can not endorse this time (unlike previous times, when it has been fine). I’d recommend finding a nice <a href="www.airbnb.com/c/hmorkel">AirBnB</a> or stay at one of the <a href="https://www.visitumea.se/en/stay">Hotels</a> in the city. I ate at <a href="http://vezzo.se">Vezzo</a> and it was DELICIOUS, the Calzone and the Goat-cheese Salad are highly recommended and they also have some tasty local beers on tap. There’s other nice places around, best is you use Tripadvisor when in town to find something which suits your wants.</p>

<h2 id="maps--gear">Maps &amp; Gear</h2>

<p>There’s a Swedish language Hiking and Fishing Map of the complete trail, but it isn’t very detailed and also slightly outdated. You can <a href="http://www.visitbjurholm.nu/sites/bjurholm/files/orealven_2013_liten.pdf">see it here</a>. For more Infos on the trail visit the <a href="https://www.visitumea.se/fi/varaa/tehtava/a475875/vandra_langs_orealven__475875/showdetails?filter=c%3D24264">Öreälven River Trail website</a>.</p>

<p>Because of the camera gear, drone and the forecasted rain I opted to use the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/arcteryx-bora-ar-50-backpack-trekking-backpack/?pid=10239">Arc’teryx Bora AR 50 Backpack</a> because it was slightly larger in volume than the Osprey Levity 45 which I planned on using. I slept under the Vaude Alpstein 450 quilt on my trusty <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/therm-a-rest-neoair-xtherm.html">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XTherm</a>. I slept one night in the <a href="http://locusgear.com/items/hapi-sil/?lang=en">Locus Gear Hapi Sil</a> and had the <a href="http://www.rutalocura.com/trekking_poles.html">Ruta Locura Yana Poles</a> along, water was boiled with the <a href="http://bit.ly/2xKSMG0">Jetboil MicroMo</a>. I used the <a href="http://bit.ly/2z2OFsC">La Sportiva Akyra</a> for the first time and they were OK, as it was very rainy the shoes stayed wet from start to finish (never mind the 10 minutes the first two mornings where I managed to dry them a wee bit). Other gear were tried &amp; trusted favourites: The <a href="http://bit.ly/2fij250">Arc’teryx Satoro AR Zip Top</a> as a long-sleeve, over which I wore the <a href="http://amzn.to/2dO11Gm">Black Diamond Coefficient Vest</a> or a <a href="http://bit.ly/2jQ9i4U">Arc’teryx Proton LT Hoody</a>. I mostly wore the <a href="http://bit.ly/2wawi0l">Houdini Aegis Jacket</a> over all those, and on my legs there were the <a href="http://bit.ly/2fiiGer">Arc’teryx Gamma Rock Pants</a> while on my head there was the well-used <a href="http://bit.ly/2dZuBfn">Arc’teryx Neutro Visor</a> and the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/06/julbo-trek-zebra.html">Julbo Trek Sunglasses</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the fourth Episode of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/how-does-it-taste/">How Does It Taste?</a> the stove stays cold and I try an Ambronite Supermeal Shake!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/38011092551/in/photostream/" title="Ambronite Snack Portions"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4510/38011092551_ac0df2000b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ambronite Snack Portions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I have tried <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/01/the-ambronite-supermeal-diet.html">Ambronite</a> last year (check out the short hair &amp; beard!) and did so in not the intended way. This time around I’m smarter, Ambronite updated their recipe <em>AND</em> introduced three new flavours <em>AND</em> added smaller pouches to their offerings which makes it more attractive to the outdoorsy person. <a href="https://youtu.be/09kMJLEYJW8">Watch the video</a> to see how I like this meal:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/09kMJLEYJW8?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><strong>In short:</strong> I still think all the vitamins, minerals, protein and other healthy stuff in Ambronite make it a smart <em>addition</em> to a normal (freeze-dried/ dehydrated) backpacking diet. If I look at my own backpacking diet, which consists of a MYOG Müsli &amp; Coffee for breakfast, a couple of Müsli and Chocolate Bars for lunch, and a Main Meal for Dinner I see room for improvement when it comes to the stuff I usually eat at home (Smoothies, quite a lot of fruit and vegetables). As carrying vegetables and fruits into the outdoors is from a weight-perspective not smart (unless dehydrated) Ambronite Supermeal with it’s full load of <em>healthy stuff</em> is a really smart way to get those things your body needs to perform at its best. The taste is better than the version I tried last year - Ambronite tweaked the recipe a bit - and given that it is Vegan and mostly made up of organic ingredients there’s really not much which should keep most people from at least trying Ambronite. And if you’re now curious: You can try 4 <a href="https://eu.ambronite.com/hikinginfinland">Ambronite Supermeals</a> for the price of 1 if you follow that link - in my opinion the perfect way to test it and see if you like the taste of it!</p>
