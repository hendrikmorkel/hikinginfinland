    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you want to spend an active week of holidays in Scandinavia, Åre is the place to go: Kayaking, trailrunning, hiking, kite surfing and downhill biking are just some of the activities you can do in this wonderful little village in Western Sweden. In the autumn the village is especially pretty, as the hills with their bilberry shrubs turn red and the birches add their golden leafs for that wonderful relaxing autumn feel!</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-re-sweden">Getting to Åre, Sweden</h2>

<p>As sustainability grows more and more important to me I find it harder and harder to book a flight. While you can fly to Åre I have a <a href="https://www.wasaline.com">ferry</a> in my town, that allows me to be very quickly in Umeå, Sweden. From there I can hop on a <a href="https://www.sj.se">train</a> and be in six hours in Åre, arriving right in the centre of the village. This is a very affordable and relaxing way to travel for me, as I can watch my favourite Youtube channels, read books, plot down ideas for articles and of course study the map for my upcoming backpacking trip in Vålådalen! From Finland you can also leave from Helsinki and Turku with the <a href="https://www.tallinksilja.fi">ferry to Stockholm</a>, and then take the sleeper train to Åre - allowing you to arrive well-rested in the morning and start your day in the active outdoor capital of Sweden!</p>

<h2 id="learning-downhill-biking-at-scandinavias-largest-bike-park">Learning Downhill Biking at Scandinavia’s largest Bike Park</h2>

<p>“<em>Are you Hendrik?</em>” my Guide Jesper asked me when I entered the Skistar Shop on the Main-square of Åre. “Yes, and I’m here to learn downhill biking. And I’m afraid.” “<em>That’s good!</em>” Jesper replied, and from then on I knew I was in good hands. Odin helped me get dressed in my “full-body harness” as I referred to it, a combination of a chest and back protector, hand and elbow protectors, shin and knee protectors and of course a helmet and googles. “<em>Have you ever sat on a Full-Suspension Bike?</em>” Jesper asked me when I was dressed. “No” I replied. “<em>No Problem, I’ll teach you everything there is to know about Downhill biking, from braking, getting up the mountain with the lift and safely getting down!</em>”</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/45002158152/in/dateposted/" title="Downhill Bikes are fun!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1966/45002158152_acf8fcdc3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Downhill Bikes are fun!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<em>Have you ever sat on a Full-Suspension Bike?</em>” Jesper asked me when I was dressed. “No” I replied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After I got my full-suspension bike we headed out and up towards the lift, where we stopped on a flat space and Jesper gave me the instructions I needed to get down the mountain, from the position of my feet (parallel to the ground), how to brake (with both brakes at the same time) and where to look while riding (as far ahead as possible). Then I needed to demonstrate what I was just told, and after a couple of circles Jesper decided I was ready to hit the tracks. A short instruction on how to put the bike into the chair lift followed, though attentive staff also was on hand and ready to help in case I’d mess up (I didn’t 😊).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/45002083102/in/dateposted/" title="Jesper enjoying the ride up"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1907/45002083102_82f5175d93_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Jesper enjoying the ride up" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>On the top of the hill it was just as easy to get the bike out and walk away, and then we were ready to drop in. “I’m still afraid” I mentioned to Jesper, upon seeing the tracks and how &amp; with what speed other bikers where racing them down. “<em>You’ll be fine. We take this slow, just brake a little all the time and you’ll just do what we talked about earlier.</em>” Jesper calmed me down, and to make it a wee bit easier we also skipped the first part of the track on this first run, and went in a wee bit further down the hill.</p>

<p>Well, it went really just as fine as Jesper said. Maybe my experience of riding bike every day, bikepacking and riding on local trails had given me a good foundation and idea on how to ride downhill, but soon I was whooping as I took a curve high and fast or racing over the narrow trails. Yes, I was braking and definitely not as fast and good as many others riding in <a href="https://aresweden.com/en/are-bike-park/">Åre Bike Park</a>, but damn did it feel good to turn that fear into confidence, joy and hollers as I was riding down Åreskutan!</p>

<p>That first day we were two and half hours out in the Bike Park, and I not only got to see the best view over Åre, but I also got to ride many different trails - from the Beginner-friendly Serpentinen to the gorgeously scenic Organic. I really was overjoyed about the experience, and even if I didn’t master the jumps very well (taking off to early, with too much speed or not landing right) it was an amazing afternoon!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31177203358/in/dateposted/" title="Taking the curve"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1970/31177203358_6a4b0d156e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Taking the curve" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The next day - because all good things come in pairs! - I headed back in the morning to the Ski Star Shop, and with some luck &amp; good timing Jesper and me were the first people on the lift up. There’s several chair lifts which bring bikers up the mountain, as well as the cable car, though sadly it was too windy and so the latter was grounded. That meant we wouldn’t be able to ride from the top as Jesper had planned, but he had some great trails for me to ride nevertheless. I asked if it’d be OK to ride down Serpentinen again as the first ride, so I can “<em>get back into the groove on familiar terrain</em>” and that was just what Jesper had planned.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31177213698/in/dateposted/" title="Åre Bike Park and Åresjön"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1970/31177213698_ecf52e3eb1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Åre Bike Park and Åresjön" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then we took another lift up, rode to the other side of the mountain and enjoyed another scenic trail which brought us back down to Åre. Back up Jesper decided I was ready to ride Shimano, Åre’s most famous red trail. Shortly my fear flickered back up, but with some confidence inspiring words from Jesper I dropped in. Shimano has some 50 or so jumps (and I rolled over at least 40 or so of them 😬🤣) and 20 fat bank curves where you almost ride parallel to the ground, and it’s a trail which had me hollering quite a bit when I mastered a curve or a jump! After Shimano we had a small Fika in town, and then hit the trails a few more times before it was time for me drop off my gear and bike, say many thank yous to Jesper and leave the shop with a big, fat smile!</p>

<p>Downhill biking thus. It is strangely relaxing to ride down that narrow trail, always looking far ahead, not going too slow so you can take that curve as high as possible, and also trying to taking in that amazing scenery. You life in the present, things which you had on your mind while walking to the lift - remember that fear from the beginning? - are pushed aside, to be pondered about at another time, if ever again. The focus is on the trail in front of you, and when you arrive down at the lift station - a big smile and the excitement of that adrenaline rush leaving your brain. It’s addicting, and after years of wondering what people find in this “dangerous sport”, I know: Focus, relaxation and joy.</p>

<p>(<em>And while I feel that I already have enough hobbies, I think I need to etch out some time to go more downhill biking. And maybe I need to visit the <a href="http://arebikefestival.com">Åre Bike Festival</a> in 2019!</em>)</p>

<h2 id="trailrunning-to-totthummeln">Trailrunning to Totthummeln</h2>

<p>Since the summer I am <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning</a> several times a week at home. Now, as some of you know, I life at the coast in Finland. Unlike, for example, the Norwegian coast, the Finnish coast is pretty similar to the Dutch coast. Which means it’s prettttttty flat over here. And while I run up and down several “hills” every week, these 15, 20 m of elevation did not really make me ready to run in the mountains. That’s the realization I came to when I was running with Björn up to Totthummeln, a scenic hill with a great view which lays between Åre and Björnen. We started from Granen, the Hotel I stayed at, and after a few hundred meters of asphalt we soon hit the Trollstigen Trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44138672535/in/dateposted/" title="Trailrunning on Totthummeln"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1909/44138672535_55bcb74c1a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Trailrunning on Totthummeln" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44138673125/in/dateposted/" title="Trailrunning on Totthummeln"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1943/44138673125_1259752daf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Trailrunning on Totthummeln" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31177183928/in/dateposted/" title="Totthummeln Summit View"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1902/31177183928_7d2857d49b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Totthummeln Summit View" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>From then on it were sweet trails that took us around the mountain, with great views over Åre, the lake and Björnen, and then up to the top of Totthummeln. Björn’s personal best time around the mountain is 35 minutes, though with my help and the visit to the summit we made it in double the time back to my Hotel… Nevertheless, it was a great run, despite the rain, and if you don’t want to run to this easy summit - you always can make it a nice day hike with the family &amp; kids!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30113974717/in/dateposted/" title="A fine view over Åre"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1954/30113974717_6f2cdd5655_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="A fine view over Åre" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="hiking-on-reskutan">Hiking on Åreskutan</h2>

<p>Before trailrunning with Björn I was out on my own in the morning, exploring the hiking trails of Åreskutan. There are over half a dozen trails which go up, around and across the mountain, and if you’re looking for a fun day hike - Åreskutan will not disappoint. Yes, you will cross the ski slopes once in a while, but most of the time you’ll be hiking in pretty forests on nice trails. There’s Cafés where you can enjoy a warm cup of coffee and a Kanelbullar, and if you don’t want to hike down you always can take one of the lifts back to the village. If the weather is good I can imagine that the hiking is very nice, and especially the Trollstigen Trail with it’s hidden treasures and wood nymphs is great for kids (it’s also only about a kilometre long, so also doable for 3 year olds!).</p>

<h2 id="exploring-the-village">Exploring the village</h2>

<p>After all that hiking, running and cycling I was hungry. Already before I left to Åre I heard about the <a href="http://www.creperielogi.se/are/">Åre Crêperie &amp; logi</a>, and the place did not disappoint! It was very cozy with super-friendly staff, and the Vegan Crêpes were amazing &amp; soooooo tasty. I also went and had coffee at the <a href="http://arekafferosteri.se/">Åre Kafferosteri</a> which roast their own coffee - definitely a recommndation. As a Houdini Friend I also of course had to check out the <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/se/vara-butiker?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzMDAhcXn3QIV7p3tCh2bEAokEAAYASAAEgK1s_D_BwE">Houdini Store Åre</a>, though I also went to see the Shops of Peak Performance (which was founded in Åre in 1986!), Stellar Equipment and Haglöfs! Besides these stores you’ll find a couple other sports stores, and plenty of Cafés and Bars to spend the afternoons and evenings.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-stay">Where to stay</h2>

<p>There’s over <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=-2468311&amp;aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">30 Hotels and B&amp;Bs in Åre</a>, so there’s something for each wallet. I stayed my first two nights at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/se/hotell-granen.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Hotell Granen</a> which is a wee bit up the hill and offered a scenic view. The Hotel had an amazing breakfast, was super-beautifully decorated (I would have wished I’d had more time to just lounge in the comfy chairs by the fire place and read or drink a 🥃 in the bar) and not even three minutes on foot and one was in the centre of Åre!</p>

<p>My last night in Åre I slept and dined at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/se/holiday-club-are.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Holiday Club Åre</a> which was equally impressive. This is a Holiday Club Hotel unlike any other I have seen - it’s modern, stylish and in the middle of town -  you get to the railway station via a bridge! The Holiday Club Åre has a Spa and Swimming Pool, and also is a popular Lunch place for the locals. I had twice a very delicious lunch here, and the Vegan 3-Course dinner was outstanding and so much that I couldn’t even finish my dessert! The room was very nice, I was sitting on the terrace in the sun and enjoying the view over the lake and town and a bit sad I had to leave so soon again.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping it up</h2>

<p>A holiday in Åre can be many things: Exciting, relaxing, and tasty. I so much enjoyed my days in this small ski town, which unlike many other ski towns in the Alps or Northern Europe is open year-round. That’s right - Åre’s shops &amp; hotels are open almost the whole year, and the <a href="https://www.skistar.com/en/ski-destinations/are/">cable cars and lifts</a> run in the winter, spring, summer and autumn: In the winter they bring skiers and snowboarders up the slopes, while from spring till autumn it are hikers and downhill bikers who take a ride up to Åreskutan. Add in its proximity to several beautiful nature places like Vålådalen and just a short trip to Norway, and like me, you probably soon will fall in love with the authentic vibe of this small town &amp; its friendly people and you’ll wonder: When can I come back?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Poor sleep is something many of us, including me, have problems with. As the stress &amp; problems of daily life mount up, we watch till late at night on our iPhones things which have zero relevance, and we generally stay up too late - because finally the kids are in bed and we want that me-time. The bill for this comes the next morning when the alarm rings early and you have a hard time to get out of the bed and start your day. If you suffer regularly from a bad sleep at home, it’s time to detox and put your bed up outdoors.</p>

<p>Research from leading Universities across the globe has shown that the modern human that you and me are sleeps up to two hours too little each night. That not only has the immediate effect of feeling tired or sleepy in the morning, but in the long-run your general health will be deteriorating and you’re opening up the door to sicknesses like cancer, type-2 diabetes and heart diseases, amongst others. Much of this has to do with where we life: In our cities and homes we are no longer in touch with the natural light-dark cycle of nature - especially in big cities it can feel like it’s “light” outside all the time. Sitting with a tablet in hand on the sofa or watching “just one more Episode” of Game of Thrones doesn’t help much either to get at a good time into bed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The ramifications of insufficient sleep are quickly felt: Studies show that just one night without proper rest quadruples your risk of catching a cold.”</p>

<p>So while it might sound counter-intuitive for the city dweller to go outside to sleep well (“What about the bears and spiders?”) the reality is that after some activity in the mountains &amp; forests and the fresh air you are bound to have a good night’s sleep. Especially since there should not be any lights, tablets and TV Shows keeping you awake. With this article I want to encourage you to go sleep outside in nature if you suffer from poor sleep at home, and what follows are my tips from over a dozen years of experience of sleeping outdoors.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-go-sleep-outside">When to go sleep outside</h2>

<p>No, you don’t need to go to sleep when the sun goes down and wake up when it nips back up over the horizon the next morning. Depending on the time of the year I like to be at my camping spot between 18 and 19 o’clock in the evening, have the tent and bed set up while it is still light and then have dinner. If it’s possible I like to also sit around the campfire and drink a hot chocolate, not only is watching the fire so relaxing, that hot chocolate also will keep you warm at night. I need my 8 hours of sleep a night, but just like people are not the same also the sleep needs of every person is different - some can manage with 6 hours a night, others need their 9 hours to feel good the next day. There’s no right or wrong when sleeping outside (or inside, for that matter) - when I feel tired, which outdoors is usually around 22 o’clock, I go brush my teeth, have that final pee (because I don’t like to get up &amp; out in the middle of the night!) and snug up in my quilt. I often have an Alarm set for the next day, but the reality is that I am awake around sunrise and then just nap till I feel like I want to get up. This is especially amazing if I don’t have a schedule to adhere to or have to be somewhere at a certain time. I potter around in the mornings, packing up while having breakfast, and slowly getting ready for another day of hiking.</p>

<h2 id="keep-that-phone-off">Keep that phone off</h2>

<p>If you sleep bad at home the reason could be the phone, computer or tablet which you’re starring at on the sofa. So the Number #1 Rule when going to sleep outside is to keep the phone off. Yes, it’s tempting to upload a photo on Instagram, check the Twitter feed or something else meaningless which you can do on Social Media. From my own experience of sleeping outside for the past 20 years I can only recommend to not use the phone in the evenings. Keep it in Airplane mode, but keep it away and don’t watch on that tiny screen while you’re out in nature. Chances are you could see the Northern Lights in the sky instead, or watch the millions of stars which illuminate the night sky and which you can not see in the city.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29842882657/in/dateposted/" title="Put the phone off!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1870/29842882657_dfd7ff5769_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Put the phone off!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sleep-next-to-a-creek">Sleep next to a creek!</h2>

<p>Sleeping next to a creek or river - for some a sure way that they feel like they need to pee all the time, for others the most relaxing sound to fall asleep to. I really like to camp next to rivers and always try to have one close by - on my recent backpacking trip in Vålådalen I slept every night next to a river, and it was glorious. An advantage of sleeping close to that relaxing sound of water rushing over rocks and pebbles is that water for brushing your teeth, cooking and coffee is never far away - and if you want to kick-start the next morning, a quick dip in the river will have you wide awake in no time! (<em>Bonus Advantage of sleeping next to a noisy creek: You don’t hear the bear and reindeer walking through your camp at night!</em>) 🐻 🦌</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/43869660855/in/dateposted/" title="Camp next to a creek!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1889/43869660855_b254510550_b.jpg" width="1024" height="767" alt="Camp next to a creek!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="afraid-of-the-dark">Afraid of the dark?</h2>

<p>Fear of the dark is something we learn from our parents and society. Homo Sapiens, you and me, we are the top of the food chain and pretty much every predator in our natural environments will make a wide path around us whenever they see or smell us. Wolfes, Wolverine, Lynx and Bears - they will not seek you out at night in your tent to come snack on you. Now Mosquitos, that’s a different story. But: You can learn again to not be afraid of the dark. An evening stroll in the park or forest can be a good way to start this, and it might take a few times sleeping outside to feel comfortable and not afraid - though soon you will realize that the dark forest or mountains hold no danger, and you can go to sleep safely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Long term, regularly shaving an hour or more off your required sleep increases your risk of certain cancers, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, obesity, cognitive decline, depression and heart disease.”</p>

<h2 id="good-gear-for-a-good-nights-sleep">Good gear for a good nights sleep</h2>

<p>I think MicroAdventures are a good way to start getting used to sleeping outside. Even better is it to take a friend or two along - just make sure they don’t snore! These can be squeezed in during the work week - take the bike or train to the hills after work, hike to your sleeping place, roll out the bivy bag, get some water for tea and dinner boiling, and then watch how the stars are coming out. Gear-wise there seriously isn’t much needed for a good night outdoors: A sleeping pad, a quilt or sleeping bag, maybe a tent or bivy, and possibly a pillow. All of that fits into a 20 l backpack, including some dinner &amp; breakfast, a light stove and a water bottle. I would recommend that if you head out fot the first time to sleep outside to loan the gear from a friend or online, and if it feels like you enjoy sleeping outside and the activity of hiking &amp; backpacking, then invest in the best gear you can afford! Here’s my recommendations for comfortable &amp; warm gear for sleeping outside:</p>

<p>A sleeping pad is the mattress of your outdoor bed, and super important. I recommend a thick and insulated pad like the <a href="http://bit.ly/2PNrEi4">Therm-A-Rest XLite</a> or <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/therm-a-rest-neoair-xtherm-sleeping-pad/?pid=10239">Therm-A-Rest XTherm</a> if you easily feel cold as the base of your bed. Cover yourself up with a quilt as it gives you more freedom of movement - just like your blanket at home. A synthetic quilt like the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/as-tucas-sestrals-quilt.html">As Tucas Sestrals quilt</a> is less sensitive against moisture, while a down quilt like the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/01/katabatic-gear-sawatch-quilt.html">Katabatic Gear Sawatch</a> is a bit lighter and warmer still. I don’t use a pillow anymore, but just roll up my <a href="http://bit.ly/2KZmRr9">Patagonia Nano-Air Light Hoody</a> which I wear during the day and which makes for a comfortable pillow.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42251990132/in/album-72157669299782358/" title="Side view"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/978/42251990132_73498f30bd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Side view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If you prefer a bivy or a tent depends on how much “house” you want to have around you. A <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/millaris-bivy-sack/">bivy</a> lets you see the stars on a clear night, while a <a href="http://bit.ly/2PO4mIK">tent</a> gives more protection when it rains and is windy. All of this and some more fits into the <a href="http://bit.ly/2PM5xss">ULA Photon</a> or the <a href="http://bit.ly/2xnqdQx">Hyperlite Mountain Gear Porter</a> backpacks, with room for a <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/msr-windburner-10-l-personal-stove-system-stove-system/?pid=10239">stove</a> and more. Finally, on long backpacking trips I carry an extra pair of woolen socks, a dry pair of <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/icebreaker-anatomica-boxers-merino-base-layers-bf/?pid=10239">boxer shorts</a> and a 2nd <a href="https://www.houdinisportswear.com/en/men/baselayers/ms-activist-tee-f18">Houdini Activist Message T-Shirt</a> and the amazing <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/en/men/pants/ms-lodge-pants">Houdini Lodge Pants</a> for sleeping in.</p>

<h2 id="good-night">Good night!</h2>

<p>So, if you woke up tired and sleepy this or last morning, and you feel you need too much coffee to go through the day - consider sleeping outside. Together with a switched off phone and no electronic devices and a creek which runs by your comfortable and warm bed in nature you’re bound to have a healthy sleep (just don’t stay up watching for Northern Lights too long!). While one night outdoors is great to get a healthy dose of sleep, I feel after three or more nights one really starts to sleep much better in nature - so after your first couple of Microadventures, why not plan for a long weekend of sleeping in the hills or forests? <strong>Leave a comment</strong> if you slept outside this week, or plan to go!</p>

I spent the last week in Åre and Vålådalen enjoying the Swedish nature &amp; hospitality - here is what you can expect!</p>

<p>I travelled via Ferry and train to Åre, which is very easy but it takes some time.

<p>On my first day in Åre I went hiking, trailrunning and explored the little village. Even in the off-season that is now there were plenty of people out on the mountain and in the village, and after some rain throughout the day it cleared up and became a nice evening with a spectacular sunset.</p>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/06/the-ul-fellowship.html">Eight years ago I have been in Vålådalen</a> (<em>and go read that article it’s still AMAZING!</em>) and I was excited to go back. Heck, to be honest, I want to go back there right now. The autumn colours were on point, the bilberries sweet and big, and the scenery just sublime. A detailed article only about the backpacking trip comes soon so stay tuned for that, too.</p>

<p>After 92 amazing kilometres of backpacking it was back to Åre and doing something which I have never done before: Downhill Mountain Biking. A sport I had &amp; still have a massive amount respect for, and was scared of. But with my Guide Jesper I became confident and had so much fun ripping down the trails, taking these high turns, learning to jump (still learning 😂) and feeling confident on these narrow trails. Wow, that was soooo good.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.helsport.no/camp-ousland-2017">Camp Ousland</a> is an annual get-together of like-minded outdoor lovers on Manshausen Island, just a wee bit south of the Lofoten Peninsula. If you want to experience the beauty of Northern Norway with superb views on the Lofoten Peninsula, some amazing company and great activities, this is the place to be!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42635903970/in/dateposted/" title="Manshausen island"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1897/42635903970_232cf5d2f7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Manshausen island" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Disclosure</strong>: <em>I’m a <a href="https://www.helsport.no/hendrik-morkel">Helsport Ambassador</a> and I was invited to Manshausen, but did not got paid to write about this trip. As you know: I’m keepin’ it real and tell you how it is - I maintain full editorial control of the content published on Hiking in Finland. Read the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/about/">Transparency Disclaimer</a> for more information on affiliate links &amp; blogger transparency.</em></p>

<p>So yes, I’m a Helsport Ambassador, I was invited to this weekend in Norway, and I had a really good time. There were my kind of people, Northern Lights, exciting activities and as you will see throughout this article, some breath-taking scenery. Did I mention the great people already? No? Well, there was the Sisterhood of the Rope on the Nordskott Traversen, climbing buddies, fellow Helsport Ambassadors and friendly people from all across Norway, with a few Swedes and Europeans thrown in, too. Add in good food, a great location, an inspiring host and a Sauna and you’re bound to have an amazing event - whatever the Norwegian weather decides to throw at you!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30576097988/in/dateposted/" title="Nordskot Views"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1884/30576097988_d175bb4c7c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Nordskot Views" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>When you sign up for the event you can book yourself in for several activities - from Sailing on a trimaran, a Kite course, Free diving, Halibut fishing, the Nordskot traverse or a guided kayak trip - there’s lots of options and you’re bound to find something you’d like to try. I myself was climbing, did the Nordskot traverse and visited the cave, and then also went packrafting on my own (I did bring my own raft). As you’re going to an outdoor event the people who will be in your group will most definitely be on your own wave-length, so don’t worry - even if you’re going on your own you will have a great time and meet good people!</p>

<p>After I arrived on the island there was a communal BBQ and then Børge Ousland, the famous Norwegian adventurer and explorer, welcomed us to his island and the weekend ahead. I used this time to meet some people, like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/btmoen/">Bjørn</a> whom I have followed for a long time on Instagram, and get to know my fellow ambassadors. As I had a long day - I got at 4 am that morning - I retired early to my tent, and called it a night.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44395489232/in/dateposted/" title="Helsport Camp Ousland"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1853/44395489232_ab05f80641_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Helsport Camp Ousland" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The next day I went climbing and rappelling at a nearby crag. Nothing difficult but good fun to get the people who have never climbed into it. The day started wet and rainy (not really good climbing weather) but ended up sunny and nice. We returned after the climbing to the island, had a warm shower and got ready for the big meal - this evening we would all together eat Whale, prepared by one of Norway’s best chefs. I have to say I was sceptical for ethical reasons to try Whale, but in the end my curiosity got the better part of me and I tried it. And what can I say - it was tasty! It certainly won’t be something I would look for in the supermarket (especially since nowadays I eat 95% of the time a vegan diet) but back then it was something I was curious to try. After the dinner together there was a Pecha Kucha going on which I followed for a while, though as the majority of presentations were in Norwegian I again left for my tent to go to sleep.</p>

<p>The next day I was signed up to go halibut fishing, but by a lucky coincidence I could switch with Helge and got to go on the Nordskottraversen, which I really wanted to do. The Nordskottraversen is a wonderfully exposed ridge walk, and we had the best Guide - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thomasrosten/">Thomas</a> - and an amazing group with Merete, Tina and Ellen. At the start it all looked weather-wise still OK - cloudy, not bad. But once we were down on the ridge after the short abseil the rain and wind moved in, and it was a real adventure. I was soaking wet on the outside, but warm and happy about the adventure in great company. As we moved off the ridge and were bushwhacking down the mountain the sun even came out again, and as we arrived back at the shore we had nice weather! After the boat ride back to Manshausen everyone was happy to get into the warm Sauna or a hot shower, and then get ready for the Saturday night Party on the main land. Bacalhau was served and was delicious, and then there was live music and drinks and dancing and good times - I have heard, as I myself was again retiring around 22 o’clock to my tent 😂</p>

<p>Sunday came around nice and early, and it was a good looking day. I wasn’t booked in on any activity that day, so I simply joined a walk to a nearby cave. It was totally chill and nice, with good views and good conversations. After we returned once more to Manshausen you already could feel the atmosphere of departure at camp - pretty much everyone was leaving today with the ferry back to Bodø. As my flight wasn’t until the next day I stayed another day on the island, chatted with Børge and the people who were still here, went packrafting and just enjoyed the beautiful views now that it finally got really sunny with clear skies!</p>

<p>That night I also put my alarm for midnight, as I had a hunch that on this first weekend of September there could be a chance of Northern Lights. And as I looked tired out of my tent - bright green Northern Lights were dancing across the sky, with a beautiful starry sky behind it. I took my Tripod and camera out and shot till the battery was empty, and then retired back to my quilt in my warm tent. It’s always worth to put your Alarm for midnight when the Northern Lights season is starting, as that is just something so special and pretty that I always will get up for it. The next day I departed with Børge and the others back to Bodø, and after a long day of travelling I arrived relaxed and with great memories back in Vaasa!</p>

<p>In conclusion, this was a well organized event at a great location. Just to meet up with friends I’d go again, and the location is just ❤️ If you have nothing planned for August - September 2019, keep an eye on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/helsport/">Helsport Facebook page</a> where the next event for 2019 will be announced, book a flight and make sure to add a week before or after the event to visit the Lofoten, too! <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/albums/72157688129301926">View more photos on Flickr</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-there">How to get there</h2>

<p>To get to Manshausen you take a plane to Bodø and from there the ferry to Manshausen, Nordskot is the place to get off the boat. Then you either can inflate your packraft and paddle over to Manshausen Island, or wait till one of their boats comes to pick you up. I did the latter =) The Ferry from Bodø to Nordskot you can <a href="http://reissjøveien.no">book here</a>, but usually you also could just walk on the ferry and get a ticket. My definite tip would be to attend Camp Ousland and then hang on another week in the Region - for example you can take the ferry onwards to Svolvær in the Lofoten, and explore that inspiring place.</p>

<h2 id="accommodation">Accommodation</h2>

<p>Those that know me will be aware that I really like to sleep under a Tarp or in a Pyramide Shelter, though there are situations where a tent is the way to go - especially if you don’t need to carry the tent far (or can make someone else carry it)! My weekend on Manshausen Island in Nordland showed me the benefit of a large apsis to store gear and a dry, spacious inner to sleep and chill while the rain is pounding the flysheet. Obviously my tent was from Helsport, this time around I was sleeping in the spacious <a href="https://www.helsport.no/lofoten-superlight-camp">Lofoten Superlight Camp</a> which I really like - more on this tent at some other time, though. If you don’t want to sleep in a tent or under a tarp while at Camp Ousland, you also can sleep in one of the <a href="http://www.manshausen.no">amazing houses</a>, on a boat, and some other indoor options are available, too.</p>

<p>As I wrote <a href="">elsewhere</a>, I have fallen in love with running again this summer. I try to run three times a week, sometimes I succeed, sometimes I fail, and sometimes I run even more often. Down in Helsinki I was exploring the city during my evening runs, while here in Vaasa I stick mostly to my home round (and I have to admit, that does at times get boring, but on the other hand it is nice to see how I get faster). This goes in line in trying to build up a better level of fitness and also I am trying to lose some weight. As I have been running for the last four years or more basically in the same running shorts and shirt (and still run in them, as they still are in great shape and not broken) and only have been switching shoes, I felt that now that I run so often it’d be nice to have a second set of clothes to wear when I hit the trails when the other one is in the laundry (I do sweat a lot and while I wear them a minimum of two times and air dry them after each run, that’s about as much runs I get out of one pair of running clothes 😂). Without much further ado, I give you all the kit I use when out running!</p>

<h2 id="salomon-exo-twinskin-shorts--s-lab-exo-hz-ss-tee">Salomon Exo Twinskin Shorts &amp; S-Lab Exo Hz S/S Tee</h2>

<p>At a regular retail price of around 140 € for the shorts and 100 € for the shirt this is a piece of kit which I think is only for those who really run a lot and think they need it. A word of warning, too: These seem to not be sized correctly - I have a Size M Shirt which I barely get on and off (I usually wear Size S) and the Shorts in Size S are also a snug fit. I also got an <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/salomon-explore-s-s-tee-t-shirt/?pid=10239">Salomon Explore S/S Tee</a> and that’s true to size. Anyway, lets look a wee bit at these two exceptional pieces.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/salomon-exo-twinskin-short-running-shorts/?pid=10239">Salomon Exo Twinskin Shorts</a> are a compression tights and a shorts in one. They do their job well and if I wear these I can run longer and am less fatigued. I do think Salomon could have been more generous with the sizes of the pockets, though - there’s a tiny zippered pocket on the back and an open mesh pocket on the front. Except a key and some Gels I won’t be able to get much stored in these, which is a shame as that means for my runs I need to somehow carry the iPhone (which I need for Music) in another way (my old Arc’teryx shorts has five pockets, one of which is massive enough for the phone). It has a long list of features - Skin fit with Exo Sensifit Agility compression, 37.5 technology, 360 degree reflective details, amongst others - but in short this is a great shorts for me for the coming months when it will be a bit cooler. / <em>122 g in Size S</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/salomon-s-lab-exo-hz-s-s-tee-running-shirt/?pid=10239">S-Lab Exo Hz S/S Tee</a> has zero pockets, a zipper in the front which helps with venting, silicone prints on the sleeves and hem to keep the shirt in place, and then this <em>“Exe-Skeleton”</em> structure which also seems to help me to run faster and get less tired. The fabric dries really fast and does not feel moist or cold after a long run, which is pretty good as it starts to be cooler in the evenings (it’s soon autumn after all). All that said, I’m not sure if this is a shirt for every runner out there - while it certainly is great, it’s also pretty expensive. / <em>102 g in Size M</em></p>

<h2 id="salomon-s-lab-speedcross">Salomon S-Lab Speedcross</h2>

<p>I haven’t worn the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/salomon-s-lab-speedcross-trail-running-shoes/?pid=10239">Salomon S-Lab Speedcross</a> heaps as of yet, but two things: They are fast &amp; light, and they have very little ankle support. I don’t think I need to say much about the former (my pair in 42 weighs 560 g), but about that ankle support: I like to think of myself of having strong ankles, because I very seldom wear boots and pretty much all the time wear Luna Sandals, light <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/08/la-sportiva-tx2-review.html">approach shoes</a> or some other trailrunning shoe. And I don’t know if it was because it now gets earlier dark and I often run during dusk, or something else, but I have the feeling that I twist my ankle more often in these shoes. Now if I say <em>“twist my ankle”</em> I don’t mean that I injure myself, but when I am out running on my home trail then on the washed-out downhills and narrow, rocky forest path I did have a little slip of the ankle more often than in other shoes I have worn this summer. Another <em>design flaw</em> in my opinion is that the pocket for the laces is a wee bit too long, it makes it more difficult to store the laces in it. Other than that I really like these shoes (they’re light! they’re fast!) and will continue to run in them, after which I might follow up on the thing with the ankles. / <em>560 g for the pair in Size 42</em></p>

<h2 id="suunto-spartan-ultra-all-black-hr">Suunto Spartan Ultra All Black HR</h2>

<p>I admit that before I owned the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/suunto-spartan-ultra-black-multi-function-watch/?pid=10239">Suunto Spartan Ultra All Black HR</a> I didn’t use a watch at all - the Apps and clock on my iPhone where good enough. But about two years ago Suunto sent me this watch, and it has been on my wrist ever since. It does a lot of good things for me - it counts my steps each day and hence reminding me to walk more, it has GPS for backpacking and several functions which I value. But for running I really love it, as together with the HR Belt I can keep an eye on my heart rate and get an idea how well I am doing. It is paired with the Movescount App on the phone and when I am back from a run it doesn’t take me long to have my run online, and I usually share it also with my brother so we keep each other motivated to go running =) This is likely for the vast majority the last bit of kit which should be considered (as Apps on phones can do almost all of what the watch does, too). / <em>75 g for the Watch and 44 g for the HR Belt</em></p>

<h2 id="inov-8-socks">Inov-8 Socks</h2>

<p>If you wear shoes, you’re likely also wearing socks. My <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/running-socks/?pid=10239">running socks</a> of choice right now are from <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/brands/inov-8/running-socks/?pid=10239">Inov-8</a>, I bought these several years ago and they work well for me - they’re a low cut, light, dry quick and don’t smell too bad after one run. / <em>36 g in Size M</em></p>

<h2 id="inov-8-race-ultra-hydration-system">Inov-8 Race Ultra Hydration System</h2>

<p>I also refer to this as my <em>Waterbottle Thingy</em> but inov-8 calls this a <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/inov-8-race-ultra-hydration-system/?pid=10239">Hydration System</a>. I bought this as I don’t want to always carry a pack, belt or vest when I go running, and this works really well for me. You strap it to your hand, put the bottle in [I bought the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/inov-8-softflask-05-folding-bottle/?pid=10239">500 ml soft flask</a> because that 250 ml bottle it comes with is a joke] and running I go. The 500 ml flask is good for an hour of running, anything longer and I likely will take a vest or belt to stay hydrated. In the <em>Waterbottle Thingy</em> there’s two small pockets so I also can put a key safely away and carry a gel. Pretty handy, and despite my concerns that it might not be comfortable or such, I have been running all summer with it and find it fantastic. / <em>19 g for the strap, 29 g for the empty 500 ml soft flask</em></p>

<h2 id="salomon-air-logo-cap-and-active-gloves">Salomon Air Logo Cap and Active Gloves</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/salomon-active-glove-gloves/?pid=10239">Active Gloves</a> haven’t seen any use yet, but I expect them to come in handy when it will be single digits in the mornings and evenings when I head out for a run. They allow me to use the phone and are light at 34 g, now I just need to see if they keep my fingers warm and if they’re not too hot to make my hands sweat! / <em>34g in Size L</em></p>

<p>I wish I would have bought the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/marken/salomon/?pid=10239">Air Logo Cap</a> earlier. It is really breathable with the mesh back, reasonably light at 44 g and most importantly, it is comfortable, all day long. I tried another cap earlier in the summer and was disappointed, but this one is really good and I reckon it will also come along on backpacking trips with me. / <em>44 g</em></p>

<h2 id="other-shoes">Other shoes</h2>

<p>I have written in my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/gear-outtakes-summer-2018.html">Gear Outtakes</a> article about a few other trailrunning shoes I have used this summer, all of which I have liked. Each pair seems to excel in different conditions, and some of the shoes I got (like the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/s/La--Sportiva--VK/category--outdoor-shoes/?pid=10239">La Sportiva VK</a>) really are superb shoes for my local trails, while some other ones I will be using when I go running in the mountains later in the autumn. I might follow this article up with another article before the winter when I have ran a decent amount of kilometres in each pair.</p>

<h2 id="petzl-nao">Petzl NAO+</h2>

<p>I have used the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/petzl-nao-headlamp-bf/?pid=10239">NAO+</a> for a long time (I was a Beta tester for it) and still find it my favourite lamp for running and other activities when it gets dark (hiking, cycling, ice climbing and ski-touring, for example). At 195 g it is not the lightest headlamp out there, but with a maximum of 750 lumen it illuminates the trails really well and I don’t need to worry about not seeing a root or slippery rock. It sits secure on my head, the weight is well distributed and it’s easy to control the lamp via the iPhone app to change settings. If you run in the dark and want a light that adjusts it’s output depending on where you look - this is the one you want! / <em>195 g</em></p>

<h2 id="jaybird-freedom-2-headphones-buff-and-oakley-latch-shades">Jaybird Freedom 2 Headphones, BUFF and Oakley Latch Shades</h2>

<p>I don’t run without music. I find it helps me to lose my mind when running, power up hills and get energy when I think I can’t continue anymore. In the middle of the summer I got the <a href="http://bit.ly/2PMkyLz">Jaybird Freedom 2 Headphones</a> and it has been such an update from the standard iPhone headphones. The latter had the cable, but the Jaybird Freedome 2 are wireless which is such a treat. On a full charge they play music for 4 hours, the block out noise really well, and they don’t have trouble with sweat as they’re Sweat-proof &amp; water resistant. The headphones come with several interchangeable tips and fins which makes getting a perfect fit with them a breeze - and most importantly, they sound fantastic! (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX06VUQ1GoKge?si=sWCKALEKRWy4kl8E0nj_1A">This is the playlist I mostly listen too when running</a>) / <em>20 g incl. the clip</em></p>

<p>My <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/buff-original-buff-multi-function-bandana/?pid=10239">BUFF</a> is ancient and I use it mainly to keep the sweat from my face and the hair outta my eyes. On those super-sunny runs it also helps protect my head from the sun, and after the run it’s easy to wipe the sweat and grime off with it. When it will turn colder it can function has a beanie or around my neck, making this a great multi-use piece throughout the year. / <em>44 g</em></p>

<p>My <a href="http://bit.ly/2olyUWR">Oakley Latch Shades</a> I bought early in the winter of 2018 and boy do I love them. They’re small in size and fit my head well, they really are anti-fog as they’re pretty open and yes, they also look cool. They are very light, super comfortable for all-day long use (and I do use them all the time when I am outside) and when I run they sit securely on my head in combination with the Buff. In the forest they keep pine needles, leaves and twigs outta my eyes, and out in the open the sun and it’s UV rays have no chance of getting into my eyes. / <em>22 g</em></p>

<h2 id="energy-for-my-runs">Energy for my runs</h2>

<p>I have used these <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/clif-bar-shot-gel-razz-energy-gel/?pid=10239">Clifbar Gels</a> and <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/clif-bar-shot-margarita-citrus-energy-gel/?pid=10239">Bloks</a> for many years now and like them, but as I am slowly transforming my diet (I aim to be Vegan, nutrition-wise, by the end of the year) I hope to find something which suits me better. I tried Trailbutter at the #OutDoorFN and loved that, but sadly it isn’t possible to get these in Europe just yet. Thus for now I will stick to the gels and blocks from Clifbar, which I can use without much problems to my stomach or digestion, and they give me a good boost when I am out on a long run!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44343939191/in/dateposted/" title="Energy"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1852/44343939191_2cb70920c8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Energy" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>That’s it!</strong> All the gear (minus some packs, which I don’t want to write about just yet) I use when I go running. It might seem a lot, though in reality it’s a pretty lightweight and compact kit and easily always comes along on my trips where I’m not backpacking for a week. Best of all, it makes me happy to put it on, head out and get my head free when I’m running through my local forests 🏃!</p>

<p>So these shorts I have been wearing pretty much the last nine or ten weeks, without and not to warm a break (they have been washed once a week and dried over night). They are comfortable, with a good length of just above the knee, and the two zippered side pockets are spacious. The shorts are airy, and as the name suggests (MYM stands for “Made To Move”) with these shorts you can do pretty much anything, from playing in the park with the kids to hiking and scrambling up a mountain. For the scorching hot weather we had these last months these were ideal, and when it’s again warm outside these shorts will be worn again! / <em>195 g in Size S</em></p>

<p>Until I bought some other T-Shirts last month my complete wardrobe pretty much consisted only of various Activist Message T-Shirts from Houdini. I love T-Shirts and these are for me the best ones out there. They’re made from 60% Wool and 40% Lyocell which makes these shirts damn comfortable - really nice soft and light on the skin. They also don’t start to smell easily - even in those 29°C days where I was sweating heaps I just aired it out over night and wore it again the next day - no sweaty smell lingered. These are fine for any occasion where you feel a T-Shirt is OK to wear - I wore these to my #OutDoorFN meetings, hiking, partying, going to the city - you name it. They’re available in a lot of different designs and colours so you’re bound to find one which you like! / <em>152 g in Size S</em></p>

<h2 id="patagonia-nano-air-light-hoody">Patagonia Nano-Air Light Hoody</h2>

<p>So this hoody I have worn almost a complete week while I was <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/10/impressions-from-the-scottish-cairngorms.html">hiking in Scotland</a> and it has served me very well. As I run pretty warm quickly I would wear this when it was ridiculously windy and also in the evenings at camp, while at night it was my pillow - just wrap it up in the hood and its ready for sleeping! This insulation piece has a deep zipper which means it’s easy to vent, it has a small zippered pocket which holds a müsli bar and camera batteries, and the cuffs are narrowed down so it layers easily under another jacket. But the main thing about this hoody is how breathable it is. Like many other backpackers, I’m lazy, and stopping to put an insulation piece off isn’t one of my favourite reasons to stop hiking. As the insulation in this is just 40 g it is warm enough to keep me toasty, but with the long zipper it is easy to vent and stay cool. Add in that it has a DWR finish which means I can wear this as an outer layer. Overall a very versatile piece that is really good for the shoulder season months and cool summer nights. / <em>273 g in Size S</em></p>

<p>The Come Along Jacket came along in the spring and has been along with me since then everywhere I went, from hiking on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/06/hiking-the-causeway-coast-way.html">Causeway Coast Way</a> to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFCR_tpPOyU&amp;t=287s&amp;frags=pl%2Cwn">family hike in Nuuksio</a>, this jacket packs down so small and light that I happily always tossed it in the pack to have it with me. Made from recycled Polyamide it is windproof and water resistant, very pretty thin and soft on the skin. It has a good hood, a small chest pocket in which you can stow the jacket when you don’t need it, and the sleeves have thumbloops. It’s not as good as the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/06/gear-outtakes-spring-2016.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody</a> which still is my favourite wind jacket, but it’s a wee bit lighter and does a damn good job at keeping the wind at bay. / <em>112 g in Size S</em></p>

<p>The Akyra from La Sportiva has a 9 mm Drop which is quite a lot for me, and when I have worn shoes with little to no Drop before (Drop is the difference in height between the heel and toes) then I need some time to get used to the Akyra. I like them for long hikes in the hills (I’ve worn them on my Scotland trip, for example) but for running they are not my kind of shoe - because I like to feel closer to the ground. The laces are not very durable and fray or break, revealing the core. This is a surprise, as the laces on my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/08/la-sportiva-tx2-review.html">La Sportiva TX2</a> are after two years of use still like new. The mesh upper is nice and airy, which makes the shoes dry relatively fast, and the Frixion sole has good grip on wet and dry undergrounds alike. They’re a very comfortable shoe otherwise, and I will be wearing them again on long backpacking trips. / <em>738 g for the pair in Size 42</em></p>

<p>The Cloudventure Peak has seen a lot of runs over the summer from me, but no hiking yet. I liked the 6 mm Drop quite well, and these “Clouds” give a nice cushioning on the trails I ran on with them. They’re fast shoes, and really light, with a nice fit and good traction on rocks, gravel, and forest trails. My friend Dan likes them but has had issues with the durability of the clouds, and as I only ran around 50 km in them thus far please don’t consider this my final judgement - maybe I will do a full review on them next summer, after I have used them a lot more! / <em>496 g for the pair in Size 42</em></p>

<p>The Luna Sandals OSO Flaco is a shoe I have used a lot more! This is my second pair of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a> and like the first pair these are shoes, äh, sandals that I love dearly. In comparison with my OSOs these Flacos are a bit thinner and now have a Megagrip Sole from Vibram. They are my footwear of choice when it is above 15°C and sunny, I have worn them every day this summer, from morning till evening, hiking, cycling, walking in the city, going to events and everything else. I look forward every spring to the time that I can get them out of the closet again, and am a bit sad when it gets too cold to wear them here in Finland. I love these shoes, and can completely recommend them! / <em>396 g for the pair in Size 42</em></p>

<p>Since around two years I am using an Everyday Backpack 30 from Peak Design to carry around my camera gear. I have used it for day hikes, going to events like NBE, PING Helsinki, RopeCon and of course the ISPO and OutDoor. I love the sleek design and cool look, the pocket for the laptop and small items is great. The two side pockets are large enough to carry two waterbottles each or a tripod. On the inside you can adjust the design yourself and I have it set up to carry my Drone, my A7 III in the middle, and my a6500 + Rode VideoMic Pro+ on the top. The two zippers - one on each side - give fast access to the pack, in addition to the smart lid on the top. There’s also two zippered pockets on the insides where I carry Filters, my lens cleaning kit, and an external harddrive. I even have used the pack for grocery shopping (for which I found it not so good), but when I’m on easy day hikes and in the city on assignments, then I have really liked using the Everyday Pack. / <em>1.875 g for the 30 l Volume Pack</em></p>

<p>I only had a very short relationship with the BUFF Pack Run Cap. I though an ultralight cap which keeps both the sun and my hair outta my eyes is great, but the truth is that the visor is pretty small and didn’t keep the sun out of my face. What was the bigger problem is that the One-Size-Fits-All construction with the elastic closure in the back is super uncomfortable for me - even on short runs the cap pushed into my head so that I could not imagine using this cap for any hiking. I’m back to using my old hiking Visor, even if it is a wee bit heavier. / <em>30 g, One-Size-Fits-All</em></p>

<p>I thought we had the perfect Duffel with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/06/ultralight-family-travel-with-eagle-creek.html">Eagle Creek Cargo Hauler</a> - and then Arc’teryx comes along, gives their amazing <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/10/one-duffle-to-rule-them-all-the-arcteryx-carrier-duffle.html">Carrier Duffles</a> a pair of wheels and a frame which protects the content, and then you have me scratching my head and wondering if this V110 might not be even a wee bit better? Well, it is an amazing piece of luggage. I have used it on many trips this year, and packed all the kit from the kids and me in it when we moved to Helsinki, and still had some space over. It’s huge, it’s easy to transport, it’s stylish, it’s durable and it is water resistant. If you have to transport all the gear a few times per year on family or work trips, this is a serious piece of luggage which will help you transport it comfortably from A to B. Now if it would still fold up as small as the Cargo Hauler when it is not needed… / <em>3,5 kg for the 110l Volume Version</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So plastic is a big topic right now - everyone and their dog tell you that you shouldn’t buy plastic-wrapped fruits + vegetables, say no to straws and lids for your drinks, bring your own cup and bottle and by all means never throw your plastic garbage into nature or the ocean - you have seen the images of turtles and fish being trapped in some sort of plastic garbage, for sure. But are we outdoor people aware of the plastic garbage we create when we buy new gear? <em>An experiment in gear shopping.</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/43040647875/in/dateposted/" title="Nice shirts, though"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/929/43040647875_5ae82aa417_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Nice shirts, though" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I agree with all these motions above for a more sustainable and environmentally friendly/ conscious lifestyle. They’re honestly 10 years too late, but hey, better late than never. I do all of the above, since I can remember (I’m one of these persons which will unwrap vegetables in the grocery store, which doesn’t minimize waste but sends a message to the shops - I imagine or hope). But I and the family, we still create a fair bit of plastic garbage - and some of that also comes from when I buy or get outdoor gear and apparel. Earlier this summer I bought some T-Shirts, and while I was unpacking them something struck me - the amount of plastic garbage these three shirts come in. I decided to document it and share it here, with the hope that these companies and many others realize that it is about time to rethink packaging (there are options to plastic!).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/43945947111/in/dateposted/" title="Plastic-wrapped T-Shirts"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/931/43945947111_8789600c30_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Plastic-wrapped T-Shirts" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now the plastic around our shirts, pants, jackets and backpacks are there to protect these items during transport, from wherever they are made to the distribution centres and shops where we consumers buy and order them. They are there for a reason - to protect the gear from moisture, bugs, and whatnot during transport, so we can probably not get rid of them (just yet). But highlighting this problem means some companies realize we consumers are aware of it, care about it, and want change. So that’s why I took the time to write about this issue.</p>

<p>So lets get to the garbage a T-Shirt creates. This overview gives you a good idea what the amount of plastic is that a simple T-Shirt comes in.</p>

<p>Yes, that Rab shirt comes in a MASSIVE plastic bag. It’s about three times as big as the Black Diamond plastic bag, and about four times as big as the Patagonia plastic bag.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/43040643805/in/photostream/" title="Rab Plastic garbage"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1792/43040643805_f67effeae0_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Rab Plastic garbage" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Also looking at the hang tags Rab is sadly the one which goes a wee bit over board - there are FIVE (5!) separate paper tags coming with the shirt. At least the tags are connected with a cord to the shirt, and not a plastic string. But if you compare that with the two each tags on the BD and Patagonia shirts it is more than double the tags, which is a bit overkill. But the illustrations are nice!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/43040625665/in/dateposted/" title="Rab tags"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1831/43040625665_6a24562e5a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Rab tags" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>OK, next on are the Patagonia and Black Diamond T-Shirts. These come each in similarly small bags, with two hang tags each, connected via a plastic string to the shirts. In hindsight I should have put something for scale into these images, like my Hydroflask bottle or similar, to give you something to relate to.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/43945939951/in/dateposted/" title="Patagonia Plastic garbage"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/930/43945939951_6220ca0c2c_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Patagonia Plastic garbage" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/43945944391/in/dateposted/" title="Black Diamond Plastic garbage"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/935/43945944391_d26df04370_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Black Diamond Plastic garbage" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>All together this was a serious amount of garbage (which I correctly disposed of so that it does not end up in the Baltic Sea or next to the street) and I was pretty disappointed to realize that with a simple purchase of three shirts I created such an amount of plastic garbage.</p>

<h2 id="the-alternatives">The Alternatives</h2>

<p>So in a former life where I studied corporate environmental management and worked as a management consultant I also was studying a wee bit about sustainable packaging. For the companies reading here I recommend the book <a href="https://amzn.to/2AX0hzC">Designing Sustainable Packaging</a> from Scott Boylston, or if you need a practical tip: The <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/icebreaker-anatomica-long-boxers-merino-base-layers/?pid=10239">icebreaker Anatomica  Boxers</a> come in small cardboard boxes which do protect the boxershorts and are easy to recycle - and are obviously not made from plastic (<em>We could have a discussion about the carbon footprint and whatnot that goes into the production of plastic bags versus cardboard boxes, but I don’t have the time to read several life-cycle analysis of these to come to a scientific conclusion. My common sense statement is that cardboard comes from trees, plastic from long dead dinosaurs. I prefer trees over dinosaurs. I rest my case</em> 😂).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/43040633455/in/dateposted/" title="Patagonia tags"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1814/43040633455_ceafe237a9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Patagonia tags" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The advantage of these cardboard boxes is two-fold: You also can get rid of the tags on the shirts and print all the stuff you want your customer to know on the box. Heck, you even could have cool prints and cut-out lines on the box to animate your customer to create some trees or mountains out of them (<em>OK, I might be getting a bit carried away here.</em>)! Thinking of it, several Merino wool baselayer brands do ship out their gear in these boxes, so what is good for a Merino baselayer shirt can’t be too bad for a organic cotton shirt, or?!</p>

<h2 id="so-what-to-do">So what to do?</h2>

<p>I think the best thing we consumer can do is to make our favourite brands aware of this thing. It’s one thing to say no to straws and lids when you buy your Frappucino or Milkshake, but it doesn’t help if you order three T-Shirts and they come wrapped in an obscene amount of plastic. The first step is to check if you really need another T-Shirt, or if you (like me) have a tower of shirts in your closet and you should just rotate them so that you can wear the ones which were hidden at the bottom. Most of us have so much garments in our closets that we really don’t need any more shirts, pants or jackets.</p>

<p>But when the need for something new arises, maybe do some research on how companies package their shirts and stuff (you now know about three companies already!) and maybe contact them to ask if they have plans to minimize the plastic their stuff comes wrapped in.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Some readers have made me aware of some great articles which I don’t want to withhold from you! There’s also a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/posts/2100832639947057">really good discussion</a> going on on my Facebook page about this topic, so check that out and take part!</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: Rab has reached out to me and said that they are aware of this issue and currently are reviewing their entrire packaging range, right down to tiny hanging hooks and string, so that everything is environmentally friendly. it’s a big undertaking and we should see these efforts from early 2019 onwards.</p>

<p>PS: <em>If you think that buying the shirt at the shop solves the problem - Äh, nope. The shop has unpacked your shirt, jacket and so on, so the waste gets created just one step earlier before it reaches you.</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/2626nQ" title="13413275_135531730179792_711864439_n"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1833/43206572824_c8a029d336_b.jpg" width="1024" height="820" alt="13413275_135531730179792_711864439_n" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em><a href="https://palantepacks.com/">Pa’lante Packs</a> operates out of a garage in Arizona, and John Z as he is commonly known is one part of the company - the 2nd owner is Andrew Bentz. John Z has a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/johnzahorian">Youtube Channel</a> and has hiked a lot of long trails - no wonder he had some ideas how a good pack should be made! I am very happy that John took the time to answer my questions so that we can learn a bit more about Pa’lante Packs! Withour further ado - here’s the interview!</em></p>

<p><em>John, please briefly introduce yourself and tell us who you are. Since when are you backpacking, and how did you start?</em></p>

<p>I grew up in Ohio and didn’t really begin adventuring until I started bike touring just after high school. Over time I grew more interested in the unpaved roads away from a steady stream of cars. And then while riding across the country one year I did an overnight hike in Glacier NP and had an incredible experience. I found out about the Pacific Crest Trail a few months later and promptly quit my job to do that.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/Mt8oei" title="20902598_457268361325255_7608308817087954944_n"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1838/43206572704_cdd84a016b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="20902598_457268361325255_7608308817087954944_n" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>How often are you outdoors nowadays?</em></p>

<p>I am outdoors a lot. I live out of a compact car, constantly traveling and meeting up with hikers and hiking, in addition to nesting with my laptop in libraries all over. Additionally, every year I squeeze in a few months of longer trips.</p>

<p><em>Are you two more “weekend warriors” or do you have some long distance trips under your belt?</em></p>

<p>We both have long distance trips under our belt. I have hiked the triple crown (PCT, CDT, AT), the Arizona Trail, Colorado Trail unsupported fastest known time, Great Divide Trail, various sections of off-trail routes, and another 1900 miles on the PCT.</p>

<p><em>Hiking in Finland Readers &amp; me, we are gear-nerds! What is your typical baseweight?</em></p>

<p>My baseweight tends to float around 6lbs for thru hiking. Going as high as 8 in colder conditions and as low as 2 or 3 for a pleasant overnight. Another major variable in my gear selection for each trip is balancing how much I intend to focus on some quiet time outdoors vs challenging myself with higher effort hiking vs making the best video possible.</p>

<p><em>Please tell us where the name “Pa’lante Packs” came from, and what it stands for.</em></p>

<p>Pa’lante came from Andrew’s time living in Panama, where “para adelante” is popularly shortened to Pa’lante, meaning onward or to keep going. This reflects our style of hiking, where you go fast and light, continually moving through the landscape. And this style is reflected in our products, which are designed for people who hike in a similar style.</p>

<p><em>What makes Pa’lante Packs different from other cottages?</em></p>

<p>Every cottage company is different and has its own area of expertise. Ours is currently characterized by our fast and light hiking style. We also are a bit different than many companies starting out in that we don’t really do custom work. We spend a lot of time iterating during the design process and making a lot of very deliberate design decisions and putting miles in to really live and connect with the designs before we are ready to release them to others.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0PRTrLdscvM?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><em>Is Pa’lante Packs your full-time job or “just a hobby”?</em></p>

<p>It’s a bit in between right now. We haven’t paid ourselves yet, but we are definitely very focused on the company. Andrew is graduating from college any day now and when he does he will be going full-time. I do the marketing/ brand /community side so my duties are a bit more abstract, but basically everything I do comes back around to “will this benefit Pa’lante?”.</p>

<p><em>Pa’lante Packs makes lightweight and stylish backpacks - two at the moment. Can you tell us how the idea to start the company emerged and how you see its future?</em></p>

<p>We both had similar goals, so it made sense to pair up. When we first got together to work on our initial pack designs, things really clicked. As far as the future goes, I’m not really much of a planner, just react to things as they come.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WNfoYXw-NxI?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><em>Any intentions of starting to branch out into other segments, for example offering shelters or bivys?</em></p>

<p>For sure! We have both been using our own shelter designs for a while now. But going from an MYOG project to a product for widespread use is a long road.</p>

<p><em>Are there any other cottage manufacturers in the USA that you work with?</em></p>

<p>The manufacturing company in Arizona that does our major production is a bit of a cottage manufacturer, being a small operation and the owner having a small cottage pack company as well. We also have really good relationships with Katabatic and Gossamer Gear. They have been really helpful and supportive to us as we’ve started.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/uP02f6" title="workshop"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1819/43924698051_7c75cf1939_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="workshop" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>And are you in touch with other cottage manufacturers in Europe, Japan, Canada and other places?</em></p>

<p>We are not.</p>

<p><em>Your company is still young and already has been getting good reviews and praise from all over the backpacking community. Is business going well?</em></p>

<p>The business is going well! Our major problem seems to be trying to keep up with demand, as we often sell out of our production runs rather quickly. We have not gone in debt and do not plan to, so this has provided a natural cap so that we do not grow too quickly helps keep the related growing pains down while we develop the processes to continue growing in the future if that is the case.</p>

<p><em>Can you tell us a bit how you went about the design process of your new Joey backpack, and where the inspiration came from?</em></p>

<p>The Joey started with Andrew’s JMT FKT pack in 2014. He basically wanted a simple and lightweight running vest style pack. Then this past year the design process got kickstarted when Joe McConaughy and Joey Camps both went for the self supported AT FKT and used the packs that very closely resemble what the final Joey ended up being.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XMm6d25FUQQ?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><em>John, we love to be let in on the work-in-progress stuff! What kind of new products are you working on at the moment?</em></p>

<p>I’ve been making some shelters I’m pretty excited about. Andrew’s been making some shorts. We’re in the early stages of a framed pack design. Fanny packs. I’ve been using my own fleece sweater recently. I use my own wallet. It’s a bit all over the place and based on what we want and are excited about.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/482VR7" title="P1210712"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1839/43206574614_afa765dc59_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="P1210712" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>And are there any new lightweight materials that have you all excited?</em></p>

<p>There are so many possibilities with Dyneema Composite Fabrics. If there are very specific properties you desire out of a fabric you can dial in the layers to match those needs. And in addition to things like abrasion and tear and puncture strengths, you can also get heat weldable and adhesive bonding properties. Talking to Wes, the DSM applications manager, always gets me really excited.</p>

<p><em>How works the R&amp;D at Pa’lante Packs, do you have a need yourself that you try to fix, or do some of your clients inspire you for new products and ask you for solutions to their problems, which then are adopted in the Pa’lante Packs line-up?</em></p>

<p>The start of a product always comes from our own needs. For the Simple Pack and now the V2, it came from gaining back the accessibility you lose when wanting to be uninhibited by hipbelts and large attachable shoulder strap pockets. With the Joey, it started with Andrew wanting a pack that would work well for his JMT FKT.</p>

<p><em>Where do your customer come from, and how do they find you?</em></p>

<p>In the beginning a lot of our brand awareness came from Andrew’s and my social media and trips. Internet chatter at places like r/UL and FB groups plays a big role in people’s gear awareness and decisions. And then I think that the word of mouth on long trails plays a big role. Even before everyone had a smartphone, information spread around the well established trails surprisingly quickly, and now with the proliferation of apps like instagram, hikers are extremely well connected and there are a lot of eyes on them, following their journeys.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/u8q4Tr" title="enchantments"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1832/43206572314_16552ebf65_b.jpg" width="1024" height="577" alt="enchantments" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>When and where was your last trip?</em></p>

<p>I just finished up a section hike on the Pacific Crest Trail in northern California this past week. I really love that trail and it’s always great to be out there on it, even though the weather was less favorable than I’ve experienced during the normal thru-hiking season.</p>

<p><em>And where is your dream backpacking trip taking you?</em></p>

<p>I’ve been looking at northern Canada with increasing frequency lately.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/4Th47z" title="jupiter mcafee knob"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1798/43206572214_afddc1f275_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="jupiter mcafee knob" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>Any favourite piece of gear which you always carry with you?</em></p>

<p>I take my Katabatic quilt with me on every trip. On an overnight that is often the only thing inside my pack other than food.</p>

<p><em>Are you planning to get out for a trip soon, and enjoy the spring in Utah and Arizona?</em></p>

<p>We’re going to be taking a little “business trip” on the Hayduke Trail together this autumn! Both of us have been wanting to do that trail for years, so it will be great to be out there and hike together again.</p>

<p><em>Social Media - on which channels is Pa’lante Packs active?</em></p>

<p>We are on <a href="http://instagram.com/palantepacks">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/palantepacks">Youtube</a>!</p>

<p><em>John, I thank you very mucho for taking the time to answer my questions =)</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Causeway Coast Way is a 52 km long trail which is so beautiful, that instead of hiking quicker and aiming for a fast speed, I only slowed down. To take in the gorgeous landscape. Hear the waves break and roll up the sandy beach. Feel the wind on my face. And to relax and feel happy.</p>

<p>The last time in Ireland I was <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/sea-stack-climbing-in-ireland.html">Sea Stack Climbing in Donegal</a> and hiking the International Appalachian Trail. It was a great adventure and I loved the country - the North of Ireland is still wild, beautiful and offers so much possibilities to outdoor enthusiasts. This time I picked out the Causeway Coast Way, which is also one of Lonely Planet’s top destinations in 2018. But rest assured - besides two places the trail is calm and you mostly hike on your own! Lets start things off with the video I made - tapping of the foot with the music is definitely allowed!</p>

<p>Doesn’t that look awesome? Yes, I was unbelievably lucky with the weather (and I placed so much good faith in the weather forecast that I didn’t even take a hardshell 🤣), three days of hiking in the sun and 20+ degrees with just the last morning being a bit of mist and drizzle (though it was atmospheric, as you saw in the video and the images underneath). So lets dive in into the detailed Guide!</p>

<h2 id="getting-there">Getting there</h2>

<p>I flew to Dublin, hopped on an Aircoach Bus, got a coffee and Sandwich in Belfast and switched to the Translink train to Coleraine, from where I hopped on the Bus to Portstewart. From Dublin to Portstewart is a enjoyable 4,5 hours journey with Public Transportation, and trains and Busses were running on time, staff was friendly and helpful, and I enjoyed looking out of the window. In Portstewart I strolled a short walk to my B&amp;B, where I dropped that part of my gear which I didn’t need and then went for a walk to Portstewart Strand, the start of the Causeway Coast Way. Now the Causeway Coast Way is the hiking route between Portstewart and Ballycastle, but there’s also a Causeway Coastal Route which is for people who prefer to drive a car. I think you miss out on some of the best bits if you drive a car around, many of the images here were taken at spots far from a road and hence I’d encourage everyone reading this to <strong>hike the Coastway Coast Way</strong>, don’t drive it. Yes, the Giant’s Causeway is amazing and the Carrick-A-Rede Rope Bridge is thrilling, but there’s over 50 km more of amazing scenery! Add in that the Coastway Coast Way is easy, has great paths, you can hike it in three or more days, and there’s the Rambler Bus which can take you to the next stop if you can’t walk anymore, and you realize this is a beautiful hike for any age and for hiking novices and experts alike. Alright, enough preaching 🤣 Lets go hiking!</p>

<h2 id="portstewart---the-giants-causeway">Portstewart - The Giant’s Causeway</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.culerg.co.uk">Cul Erg B&amp;B</a> in Portstewart is a stone throw away from the Causeway Coast Way, about three kilometres from the start at Portstewart Strand. After a long day of travelling I really needed to get moving, so after checking in I walked through Portstewart to the Beach and the start of the hike. Portstewart Strand is a beautiful, 3 km long golden beach and behind it are some of the biggest Sand Dunes in Northern Ireland. I made a stop at Harry’s Shack, which is a beautifully located Restaurant at the start of the beach. I walked in and enquired about the possibility of a Dinner. After a bit of banter with Donal, the owner, I was granted my wish (the kitchen was almost closed!) and sat down outside. That beach was just beautiful, and the laughter and screams of kids enjoying the water echoed over the sand till the terrace where I was drinking my cold, local beer. After a fabulous Dinner I thanked Donal and the staff at the Shack for their hospitality, and headed back towards the beach - the sun was setting, and I’m always up for watching the sun set into the ocean. Where there’s a sun, there’s often also a moon, and as I turned around the almost full moon was rising behind the dunes. Perfection.</p>

<p>During the gorgeous Dusk light I hiked back to the B&amp;B, making too many photo stops along the way.</p>

<p>The next morning started with a delicious breakfast. The Cul Erg B&amp;B is known for it outstanding offerings in the morning, and the praise I read online was spot on. Hikers will enjoy the many different options, this breakfast had me powered for the whole day - I didn’t eat another bite till Dinner at 19 o’clock that evening!</p>

<p>Time to hike. Out the door, left and then along the coast towards the Golf grounds. The Causeway Coast Way is very well way-marked here, and you hike all the time on the left of the Golf course, next to the sea, towards the next town. After 1,5 hours I reached Portrush, a popular little town. Coming from the West I didn’t get why it was popular, but once I passed the harbour and walked up to Ramore Head I could see why.</p>

<p>Ramore Head is a land tongue which gives great views out the the West and County Donegal as well the East and pretty much the complete trail which lay before me. It was nearing noon, the sun was shining down on me with 26°C and I was in need of more water - and a coffee. The <a href="http://www.arcadiaportrush.co.uk/cafe/">Arcadia Beach Café</a> is situated next to the trail, and has a super-good Kale Smoothie and Cappuccino. They also refilled my water bottle without a problem, and it was nice to sit inside in the shade for a while.</p>

<p>I hiked close to the water along the Portrush East Strand, which felt like it never did want to end. I also felt like I should drop my pack, shed my clothes and take a swim - but then I made the crucial mistake of going so ultralight that I didn’t pack a swim shorts. Big mistake! As I reached White Rocks at the End of the East Strand I needed some shade, and happily one of the large, white limestone pillars offered me a place to cool down. The white cliffs were beautiful, and you could also hike and swim at the base of them, but I had to much electronics with me, which don’t like water so much. Happily there is an equally outstanding Cliff path which takes one along the top of the cliffs and onwards towards Dunluce Castle and Portballintrae. I thus opted for the Cliff path after exploring the cliffs a wee bit from underneath, and was not disappointed by hiking on top - those views!</p>

<p>The sandy Cliff path was framed by wild flowers on both sides, and a fresh breeze helped to keep me cool. I reached the sidewalk along the A2 and took a look back over the White Rocks and Portrush East Strand, and felt happy. Traffic on this Tuesday afternoon wasn’t bad, and the views down towards the sea and the white limestone cliffs were beautiful indeed. After a while I reached Dunluce Castle, which I decided to skip, and hiked on towards Portballintrae.</p>

<p>By now the heat was almost unbearable. I had drunk my 1 l of water already since leaving the Café in Portrush, and it was still a while till the next town. There was also no shade - something that I really felt on my feet (I was wearing my ❤️ <a href="https://www.lunasandals.com?rfsn=35669.8168e">Luna Sandals OSO Flaco</a>) so as I arrived in Portballintrae I decided to hop on the Bus to the Bushmills Distillery. Hiding in the shade I waited for my ride, and sitting a bit later in the cool bus I was happy about my decision: The 3 km walk to Bushmills would have been fully in the hot afternoon sun. I walked into the <a href="https://www.bushmills.com/distillery/">Bushmills Distillery</a> and took part in a Tour of the distillery. If you’re into Irish Whiskey and have never been to a distillery the tour is well worth a visit, and if you’re a seasoned Whiskey Connoisseur then you’ll appreciate the dram or two for tasting at the end of the tour!</p>

<p>I really liked the visit &amp; the whiskey, but still needed to go to the Giant’s Causeway. A look on the map suggested walking along the small road (getting back on the trail would have involved a detour) so I opted again for the Bus. However, with 30 minutes time till it went I decided to explore the little town of Bushmills - which was a good idea! There’s an old mill and weir next to the beautiful old stone bridge, which is where I took the next image.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42062864004/in/dateposted/" title="Bushmills Mill"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1753/42062864004_a80707b6c8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bushmills Mill" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then I hopped on the bus and five minutes later got out at the <a href="http://www.thecausewayhotel.com">Causeway Hotel</a>. I first I went in to the <a href="https://giantscausewaytickets.com/the-visitor-centre">Giant’s Causeway Visitor Centre</a> and inquired if I could get to the Giant’s Causeway later in the evening, for sunset. To my surprise the visit to the Giant’s Causeway is completely free and yes, you can visit it at any time of the day or night. With that knowledge I checked in and was happy to have a long, cold shower to get rid of the grime which had collected on my sandal-clad feet. With clean feet and clean clothes I headed for an early Dinner, as I didn’t want to miss the sunset.</p>

<p>Dinner was fantastic, and despite being already 12 hours awake and having walked a fair bit I was so happy to go see the Giant’s Causeway. This is an UNESCO World Heritage Site and the images I have seen of it looked like this one:</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40969482190/in/dateposted/" title="Sunset at The Giant&#x27;s Causeway"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/899/40969482190_c2f8d46cfa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunset at The Giant&#x27;s Causeway" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I hiked down the street (during the day there’s a small bus which brings you down and up if you want) and was a bit surprised that I wasn’t alone with my idea of watching the sun set at the Giant’s Causeway. There were probably at least another hundred people, with a handful of photographers, who wanted to see the sunset. Well, what can I say: The Giant’s Causeway is magnificent. I spent three hours there and was the last one to hike back up to the Hotel, and the next morning I’d spend another two hours here, and still I feel I could have spend more time there. The hexagonal basalt columns are just so inspiring and so photogenic that I had serious problems leaving this place behind. Here’s some impressions from the evening:</p>

<h2 id="the-giants-causeway---white-park-bay">The Giant’s Causeway - White Park Bay</h2>

<p>I went to bed late, and still was considering getting up at 4 o’clock to go photograph the sunrise. I didn’t. I did get up early-ish, though, had a breakfast of pancakes (because Pancakes ❤️) and then went to visit the Giant’s Causeway Visitor centre. Hikers pay £10 entry (that’s with a discount) and you get a lot of background info on the Giant’s Causeway, from how it got to be, how FinnMcCool built it, and much more. You can loan an Audio Guide (included in the price) when you walk down to the Giant’s Causeway, which gives you more info on it (I didn’t as I couldn’t return it). By 10 o’clock I put my pack back on my shoulders and strolled down, took another photo, and continued on the Cliff path towards Dunseverick Castle.</p>

<p>The yellow Cliff Trail takes you along on the top of the Cliff, and from here you get some of the finest views along the whole Causeway Coast Way. I could see back towards Portstewart, the beginning, and towards Rathlin Island, Ballycastle and even further away in the distance was Scotland. Add in that after the hundreds of people at the Giant’s Causeway (it gets about 1 million visitors a year, with the most during the summer season - the day I was there there were 5.000 people visiting!) up here on the cliff path I met about a dozen of people. On the whole 8 km stretch, I met around 12 people. Given the absolutely AMAZING views this riddles me a bit, but I guess it also shows that if you leave the honey pot behind you will find peace &amp; tranquility.</p>

<p>The cliff trail is wide and hiking towards Ballycastle you’ll have the Sea on your left, while green fields, sometimes with sheep, will be on your right. Here and there are benches for you to take a rest and enjoy the view. I also spotted the <a href="http://www.canoeni.com/canoe-trails/north-coast-sea-kayak-trail/access-point/port-moon/">Port Moon Bothy</a>, which is a hut for sea kayakers (there’s no path down to it) and which looked great from up on top. I imagine exploring the coast via kayak and spending the night in the Bothy is also very memorable - maybe the next time!</p>

<p>The Cliff Trail goes along the Dunseverick Castle, which really is just a wee ruin - see it in the video. Here I met a French backpacker who was taking in the view, and we chatted a bit - he was exploring Ireland on foot, hitch hiking and taking the Bus, which sounded like a great way to explore Ireland. I wished him well &amp; continued on the trail, which weaved along the shore, through fields, a cave, a pebble beach and then I arrived at White Park Bay - my destination for the day. White Park Bay is a long beach which only has three entries - and none of them are easy. Which explains that despite the gorgeous weather there were only few people on the beach - later, as I would hike it back during dusk, it would be completely deserted.</p>

<p>I hiked up to the <a href="http://www.whiteparkhouse.com/index.html">Whitepark House B&amp;B</a>, and was surprised about the time - it was past 17 o’clock. I was just a 15 km walk, but with all my photo and video breaks it took me five hours to get here from the Giant’s Causeway. I didn’t mind, though - I had a fabulous day! Bob welcomed me with tea and we had a we chat, before I jumped under the shower and got a lift to Ballintoy from him. I had Dinner at the <a href="http://www.fullerton-arms.com">Fullerton Arms</a> and then strolled down towards Ballintoy Harbour. Now if you know me, you probably are aware that my wife and me are huge Game of Thrones fans, and so I of course could not not go visit Ballintoy Harbour - the Causeway Coast Way also goes past it, so you really can’t miss it! Some scenes where shot here, and again I had amazing luck and a very pretty sunset to photograph! I hiked back towards White Park Bay (including a scramble up the cliff and down as the normal path along the water was <em>under water</em>) and arrived again very late at the B&amp;B. Somehow I didn’t manage to go to sleep early on this trip - I am blaming the fabulous sunsets!</p>

<h2 id="white-park-bay---ballycastle">White Park Bay - Ballycastle</h2>

<p>The next morning rain drops were covering the window, and the clouds which were moving in the last evening now covered the whole sky and didn’t let me see far. No problem! A tasty Irish breakfast at one long table with the other guests - a couple from the USA and a lady from Australia - made for a pleasant start into the day. I really like these long tables where you have to sit together with the other guests, it brings people from different walks of life together and always has been a good experience and makes for great conversations. After breakfast I went out to explore the garden of the B&amp;B, which is absolutely lovely. I wanted to become a Gardener or Landscape Architect when I was younger, and visiting a Garden like the one at Whitepark House make me long for that.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28906697308/in/dateposted/" title="Whitepark House&#x27;s Garden"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1742/28906697308_d1918a6cc6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Whitepark House&#x27;s Garden" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Then the options were: 
<br />A. Hike along the street, in the rain, to Carrick-A-Rede
<br />B. Hike along the beach, in the rain, to Carrick-A-Rede
<br />C. Get a ride, out of the rain, to Carrick-A-Rede</p>

<p>I opted for C.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42062907604/in/dateposted/" title="Nothing to see here"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1750/42062907604_b58afd0ab3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Nothing to see here" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Carrick-A-Rede is the 2nd honey pot along the Causeway Coast Way, mainly because of the Rope Bridge and Larrybane, which also has been a location in Game of Thrones. I opted to go see the Rope Bridge. If I would see it, as the cliffs were shrouded in mist.</p>

<p>The trail is wide, with some steps here and there, sheep on the right side, the white cliffs on the left (if you can see them) and then you’re standing at the wee gate where they control the flow of people across the bridge. I showed my ticket and waited till the people from the island crossed the bridge, which hangs 30 m high above the sea, connecting the Carrick-A-Rede island to the mainland. The old Fishermen Cottage is still there (but you can’t go in) and then there’s lots of slippery grass slopes which allow you to see out to sea and observe the nesting birds. If you can see them =)</p>

<p>I explored the island, observed the birds and the mist, and then got in line to get back over the rope bridge. As I was hiking back to Ballintoy more and more people were on the path to the rope bridge, despite the not so good weather. As I hiked up towards the street I was pondering my options: Hike on the busy street, in the rain, to Ballycastle, or hop on the Rambler Bus to Ballycastle. Just as I reached the street the Bus came up the road, and like a reflex my arm went up. I purchased a Rambler Ticket to get to Ballycastle and then to Coleraine. As I was sitting in front of the bus I congratulated me on this reflex move - the narrow street would have been no fun to hike. 10 minutes later I got off the bus at the harbour of Ballycastle, and strolled down to the beach. The official end of the Causeway Coast Way hike is up in the village, but for me, I decided, this hike ends here, at the beach in Ballycastle, 50-something kilometres away from the start in Portstewart Strand. It felt odd to be finished - it was early in the day, I hadn’t hiked a whole lot yet, and really wanted to keep on moving.</p>

<p>I took out the Drone, captured some stunning footage of the mist rolling in over the town, and then walked back to the bus stop. A raven, sitting on the rocks of the quayside, looked at me, and seemed to agree that it’s a shame I had to finish here. The ferry to Rathlin Island left the harbour and I wished I would have had another day to explore this little island, see the Puffins, and breath in more of this beautiful atmosphere up here in Northern Ireland. The next time!</p>

<h2 id="practicalities-getting-around-where-to-stay--what-to-eat">Practicalities: Getting around, Where to stay &amp; What to eat</h2>

<p>I flew into Dublin and both Finnair and SAS have daily connections into the capital of Ireland, as well to Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland. Every major airline flies to Ireland, so it should be easy to find a flight to the green island. As the <a href="https://www.aircoach.ie">Aircoach Bus</a> from Dublin Airport to Belfast Central is only £14 and takes two relaxed hours I suggest flying into Dublin, it usually is also cheaper. From Belfast I took the train to Coleraine and from there the Bus to Portstewart. It’s all super easy and I used <a href="http://www.translink.co.uk">Translink</a> to plan my journey and check timetables. They run very regularly, even on holidays and Sundays, so getting around is not difficult at all and hence no car is needed.</p>

<p>I stayed in Bed &amp; Breakfasts and a Hotel, and ate out every evening. In Portstewart I stayed at the fantastic <a href="http://www.culerg.co.uk">Cul Erg B&amp;B</a>. Marie and JJ were wonderful hosts and the breakfast was outstanding! I had a single room with a shower and a comfy bed, and it is close to the trail so makes for a logical stop. If you arrive like me late in the afternoon after a day of travelling it is a nice to stretch the legs and head to Portstewart Strand, which is a 3 km stroll from the B&amp;B.</p>

<p>The next night I stayed at the <a href="http://www.thecausewayhotel.com">Causeway Hotel</a>, and the name already lets you guess why I stayed here: It’s the closest accommodation to the Giant’s Causeway! The Hotel is run by the National Trust and is very nice - it has this old-time charm and both staff and rooms were excellent. If you stay at the Hotel you also get free entry to the Causeway Visitors Centre. I ate dinner here too, which was very tasty, and they too had a local beer for me to sample!</p>

<p>My last night on the trail I spent at the beautiful <a href="http://www.whiteparkhouse.com/index.html">Whitepark House</a> where Bob was my amazing host. He not only makes an exquisite Irish breakfast, also the house and garden are fantastic and I loved exploring it. Extra points for giving me a ride into town so I could have Dinner and walk back via Ballintoy Harbour and the beach!</p>

<p>In my experience the wild camping laws in Ireland are <em>“complicated”</em> and it is easier to stay at a B&amp;B and eat at a Pub or Restaurant than carry the camping gear &amp; food. If you prefer sleeping outdoors - I have seen people camp in little bays and on beaches, so if you practice a Leave No Trace principle, pitch late and leave early I imagine you’re fine. There certainly are a lot of nice spots to camp - the only problem will be fresh water, which you probably need to get along the towns in a Café or Shop.</p>

<p>In Portstewart I ate at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HarrysShack/">Harry’s Shack</a> and had a local beer from a small local Portstewart brewery. It was outstanding - Service, food, beer. If you start your hike at Portstewart Strand, you definitely should have lunch or dinner here!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28906610268/in/dateposted/" title="Dinner at Harry&#x27;s Shack, Portstewart"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1723/28906610268_ecebaefbd7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dinner at Harry&#x27;s Shack, Portstewart" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In Ballintoy I dined on Fish &amp; Chips at the Fullerton Arms, which was good and plenty. I also tried their Mussels, which were very tasty, and it all washed down nicely with a beer from Dublin (not Guiness!). According to Bob the Fullerton is the best place to eat in Ballintoy, so I can not comment on the other establishments in town =)</p>

<p>As I ended my thru-hike in Ballycastle I took the Rambler Bus back to Coleraine, from where I took the train back to Belfast and Dublin. The Rambler drives once every hour and pretty much covers the whole hike like I walked it, which was nice to see the places again from the street. There’s also a Bus to Ballymena from where you can get faster to Belfast. Use the <a href="http://www.translink.co.uk">Translink</a> App to get the best options, it’s really a well made app (and is free). If you’re less in a hurry to get home than me, spend another night in Ballycastle. There’s Kinbane Castle close by (and along the trail, so worth a detour) and from Ballycastle you can take the ferry to <a href="https://discovernorthernireland.com/Rathlin-Island-Ballycastle-P8209/">Rathlin Island</a>, where you can see Puffins!</p>

<p>The hike is beautiful from start to finish (expect maybe the bit to Ballycastle where you hike on the road, but you can take the Bus!) and there’s not a lot of hikers on it - day hikers, yes, but few people who hike it from Portstewart to Ballycastle or the other way around. The trails are very well marked and you can’t get lost, there’s also <a href="http://www.walkni.com/walks/186/causeway-coast-way/">free map printouts on the Walk NI page</a> if you feel you need them (I saved them in an open tab on the phone and a had a look at it once in a while, but you’re pretty much always hike next to the sea - if you can’t see the sea anymore, you likely took a wrong turn or are sitting in an Irish Pub). You could hike the Causeway Coast Way in anything from one very long day where you miss out on all the good views, to four or five days. I think six days including travelling is ideal, that’d allow you to also explore Rathlin Island, Belfast or Dublin a bit.</p>

<h2 id="the-gear">The Gear</h2>

<p>I already made a PHGT Video, probably easiest to watch that if you want to know what I was wearing and carrying:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/59S58BR14Sc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Just some key pieces which I’d like to point out [<strong>Disclaimer</strong>! I’m a <a href="https://www.houdinisportswear.com/en/friends/hendrik-morkel">Houdini Friend</a> and <a href="https://www.helsport.no/hendrik-morkel">Helsport Ambassador</a>]: The <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/houdini-activist-tee-t-shirt/?pid=10239">Houdini Activist Tee</a> is pretty much the only T-Shirt I own, I got rid of all others. These shirts are simply super comfortable, don’t smell sweaty even after several days of hiking, and are easy to wash in a sink. Equally great is the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/houdini-womens-mtm-motion-light-pants-trekking-pants/?pid=10239">Houdini MTM Motion Lite Pants</a>, these are very thin softshell pants which keep insects, the sun and wind from my legs, and allow me to scramble and climb. I love my <a href="https://www.lunasandals.com?rfsn=35669.8168e">Luna Sandals OSO Flaco</a> and wear them whenever I can. There’s no better pair of shoes for me during the warm time of the year, if you have not yet tried Luna Sandals you really are missing out! I had a <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/houdini-womens-wisp-jacket-fleece-jacket/?pid=10239">Houdini Wisp Jacket</a> and a <a href="https://www.houdinisportswear.com/en/men/jackets/ms-come-along-jacket">Houdini Come Along Jacket</a> to keep me warm and out of the wind/ rain, I wore these only the last day and during the evenings. I also only brought one pack for everything, that was the <a href="https://www.helsport.no/snota-x-trem">Helsport Snota Xtreme 40</a>. It carried very comfortable the whole time, I only should make the hipbelt straps shorter as they are waaaaaay to long. I really like the Zipper on this pack, it allows me to easily access the inside and get e.g. my Tripod out.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.atompacks.co.uk">Atom Packs</a> I found when Alex Roddie tweeted about the company earlier this year, and like Alex I think the packs which Tom makes are really great looking with smart details. As I was making the list of companies to interview for this series Tom has one of the first ones I contacted, and I am very happy that he agreed to participate (he’s super-busy and hasn’t had a day off in four weeks, so order your pack AFTER you read this interview, OK ;). Without much further ado - here’s Tom’s Interview!</em></p>

<p><strong>Tom, please briefly introduce yourself and tell us who you are. Since when are you backpacking, and how did you start?</strong></p>

<p>Who am I? Whoa now, this could get deep. I guess I’m a hiker: It is at the core of nearly everything I do.</p>

<p>I started long distance hiking in 2009, setting off on the Appalachian Trail like so many others under a crippling load with as many things strapped to the outside of my bag as were inside. I think I also had maybe 8L of water with me. Urgh. That guy. The longer I hiked, the more content and quiet my busy brain became and I swiftly began to feel that this had to be something that I built my life around. I came home and began working towards becoming a professionally certified Outdoor Guide and, within a few years, was doing what I loved and sharing my passions with others every day.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/3w2A25" title="Tom Gale, Atom Packs"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1742/42680476092_9b0ecaf815_b.jpg" width="1024" height="846" alt="Tom Gale, Atom Packs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>How often are you outdoors nowadays?</strong></p>

<p>Hahaha, less so now than I would like. I tend to get out on my mountain bike for at least an hour a day. This business expanded much quicker than I’d anticipated but I try and find the time, normally I work until about 7pm and then get out for an hour, chasing the sunset through the trees on one of the mountains near my house. I’m pretty well situated for some incredible riding, even if I’m exhausted it always makes me feel better.</p>

<p><strong>Are you more of a “weekend warrior” or do you have some long distance trips under your belt?</strong></p>

<p>I’m a huge fan of micro adventure. I try and get out most weekends but the reality is that currently I don’t get much time off - Hopefully soon things will come back under a little more control. I live surrounded by mountains and lakes and it’s very easy to just grab a pack and go, but I suppose my priorities are currently with growing my business.</p>

<p>I have hiked some 12,000 miles now on the big three trails in the US, the Te Araroa and another few thousand miles around the coast of England. I don’t plan on stopping any time soon, this business might try and stop me but, hey, I’m thirty years old and it’s about time I tried some of this so-called “adulting”. I promised myself I’d give the business three years and see where I am at, only then will I decide if it was a dumb idea.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/623M9Q" title="Tom Gale, Atom Packs"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1737/42680476172_c33442b8d2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Tom Gale, Atom Packs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Hiking in Finland Readers &amp; me, we are gear-nerds! What is your typical baseweight?</strong></p>

<p>That’s a great question. I actually have no idea. Somewhere between 3 - 5 kg. I used to count every gram but after my third major hike I realised it didn’t actually make much difference to me - I’m a big guy, 6ft7 and 100 kg and I eat an absolutely OBSCENE amount of food, at least 2kg a day when on trail so my pack weight is always pretty heinous when leaving town. I also realised it was completely relative – my 3.5kg base weight felt just at terrible the day I left town on the PCT in 2015 as it did leaving town on the AT in 2009 with a 9kg base weight. It doesn’t matter what your baseweight is – your bag will ALWAYS feel like shit the day you leave town. Why worry about a couple of ounces here and there when you are about to hike out an entire rotisserie chicken, three avocados, a bunch of bananas, some beer and whole loaf of bread out of town… It’s good training. I’m not belittling the gram counting approach – for people who have some control over there caloric intake I’m sure it’s very justified – I will just always completely fill my bag with food regardless of how long it is to the next town so the base weight becomes a pretty small percentage of that.</p>

<p>There are a lot of hikers who can starve themselves on trail and come into town with zero calories i.e. without a morsel of food left in their bags. This is the elusive thru hiking “gold star” but, the reality of achieving that largely gives me an anxiety attack, I think I’ve only ever done it twice in 12,000 miles and I nearly fainted. It’s completely out of my control.</p>

<p>I do try to stay under 3.5kg but my process on a thru hike is always the same. I start heavier than I want to, then pare my gear down over the first couple of months, shedding everything I can, and then I realise I’m cold and uncomfortable and in as amazing hiking shape as I’ll ever be and then start adding luxuries items again. I’d say I’m at my most ultra light eight weeks into a hike.</p>

<p><strong>Please tell us where the name “Atom Packs” came from, and what it stands for.</strong></p>

<p>I was trying to think of the smallest, lightest thing that I could. Initially the name was Atomic Ultralight but try typing that into Google and you’ll quickly realise why I changed it, you just can’t compete with the entire spectrum of information on quantum physics. I was stuck on the name for ages and then one day the name <a href="https://www.atompacks.co.uk">Atom Packs</a> came to me. The fact it’s got my name in it as well is just a very happy accident – A-Tom Packs. People give me credit for that. They shouldn’t.</p>

<p><strong>What makes Atom Packs different from other cottages?</strong></p>

<p>I make durable, lightweight gear (Dura-lite if you will!). I build the best packs that I can out of the best materials available to me. Sure, there may be lighter materials available, but that comes at a cost of either durability or comfort. The way I see it, there has to be some sense behind design: A backpack has the hardest job of any piece of gear that you carry, it is responsible for holding onto literally everything else that you take with you into the wilds and an extra few grams in its design can greatly increase both the durability of the pack and the carrying comfort of the user - In my view that is well worth the weight penalty. If you design a pack right, you won’t know that it’s heavier because the weight is working FOR you, not AGAINST you.</p>

<p>I think, in essence, most companies are all in this for the same reason: There isn’t the gear that we desire available to us, so we make our own. Every hiker on the planet has a different way of doing things, so I aim to create the gear that individual people want. Sure, some people will say that another brand/ fabric/ method is better, and they could well be right when it comes to their way of hiking, but I have designed my brand to be flexible to peoples needs so, I’d ask that person to shoot me an email and lets talk. It’s a great learning experience for me as well as people force me to step out of my comfort zone and design something new – quite a few of these requests have actually become part of my daily designs.</p>

<p><strong>Is Atom Packs your full-time job or “just a hobby”?</strong></p>

<p>It’s now full time! Argh! I have some token bits of guiding work over the summer but the reality is that I can’t really afford the time away from the business at present so, yep, I now sew for 70+ hours a week. It’s pretty intense.</p>

<p><strong>Atom Packs makes lightweight and stylish backpacks and backpack accessories. Can you tell us how the idea to start the company emerged and how you see its future?</strong></p>

<p>It mostly came from a need to create the gear that I wanted - I’m so tall that any off the shelf backpack/ daypack that I bought ended up with its hipbelt somewhere below my nipples. Combine this with a natural curiosity for the unknown and I found myself sitting at a sewing machine making quite a horrible mess. That is basically the process that is still ongoing today, if not a little more refined!</p>

<p>In the coming weeks I am moving into a proper workshop. Here I will expand my production to cope with demand and begin training up an employee or two. I know that this business cannot possibly expand any more than it currently is with me crouched over a sewing machine for 70+hours a week. The danger is that I eventually have some kind of sewing-induced break down and run bare-assed and screaming into the cold night, never to be seen again. A lot of cottage companies have gone the same way and I’m trying really hard to not make the same mistakes. I’m still slipping and sliding my way along the learning curve but my processes are getting more refined with each day.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/71118j" title="Tom Gale, Atom Packs"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1727/28856276158_a294c57d60_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Tom Gale, Atom Packs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Any intentions of starting to branch out into other segments, for example offering shelters and bivys?</strong></p>

<p>Yes… but lets not get ahead of ourselves.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any other cottage manufacturers in the United Kingdom that you work with?</strong></p>

<p>Not at present. Everyone I have spoken with has been very supportive though! I’d love to team up with a few brands in the future, that way we can all benefit.</p>

<p><strong>And are you in touch with other cottage manufacturers in Europe, Japan, Canada, the USA and other places?</strong></p>

<p>Other than a few messages/ comments via Instagram, not currently. There are some great companies making some great kit out there, Instagram gives you a nice peek into what they’re up to.</p>

<p><strong>Your company is a just several months old and already has been getting good reviews and praise from all across Europe. Is business going well?</strong></p>

<p>Haha, yes it blew up pretty quickly didn’t it!? I properly launched the website at the end of February and quickly got far more orders than I knew what to do with. I don’t advertise or spend money on promotion, I’m just trying to let it naturally grow by putting the product out there to be seen. Any product worth its salt will succeed, given the chance, I’m just very wary of outstripping my production capacity. I think that’s always the issue with cottage companies – when you are one guy in a shed it is easy to get overwhelmed and something that started off as creative and fun becomes a great, snarling monster that consumes most of your life. It’s been quite a journey, that’s for sure.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit how you went about the design process of The Atom pack, and where the inspiration came from?</strong></p>

<p>I used to work with Adrian Moore at Aiguille Alpine Equipment and he used to say that “if you take away everything else, a rucksack at its most basic is just a potato sack with straps”. <a href="https://www.atompacks.co.uk/product-page/the-atom">The Atom</a> came from stripping back everything that I knew about backpacks and starting from the ground up. I wanted people to be able to start with a tube and add whatever they wanted to it, The Atom as you see it is exactly the pack that I would want on a thru-hike, it just happens that that has become the standard design.</p>

<p>I have to give some credit to “Dubstep”, my esteemed hiking companion of 5000 miles. I asked her to design her perfect backpack and she, not taking the process particularly seriously, designed a pack with rockets on the side pockets. That’s what inspired some of the Atom’s aesthetic, I was trying to make it look like a rocket.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/1C640E" title="Tom Gale, Atom Packs"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1750/28856276118_7a1db6739b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Tom Gale, Atom Packs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Tom, we love to be let in on the work-in-progress stuff! What kind of new products are you working on at the moment?</strong></p>

<p>Removable carbon frames. They’re the future!</p>

<p><strong>And any new lightweight materials that have you all excited?</strong></p>

<p>Liteskin by Dimension Polynant. I bought a bunch of it and have been experimenting with it a little. KS Ultralight have been using it but I’ve not seen any long term reviews yet. It strikes me as a really solid fabric that, for its weight, is pretty incredible. I designed a 35L Atom with a padded hipbelt that came in at under 380g - that’s pretty special! The big test will be how well it holds up. I’ve been working with Andrew Sherry (@thehikingstory on Instagram) – I’m keen to send him one to try and break it just to see how well it holds up as there have been no real long term tests done yet and everyone, myself included, are a little twitchy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/VEnfyk" title="Tom Gale, Atom Packs"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1760/28856276628_2eb647b7aa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Tom Gale, Atom Packs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>How works the R&amp;D at Atom Packs, do you have a need yourself that you try to fix, or do some of your clients inspire you for new products and ask you for solutions to their problems, which then are adopted in the Atom Packs line-up?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I think I sort of answered this before. I have already solved the problems that I have encountered, so when people come to you with new issues it can really help to develop the product forwards.</p>

<p><strong>And where do your customer come from, and how do they find you?</strong></p>

<p>I put something on Reddit in February and it sort of went a bit wild from there. I sell a lot of packs to Germany and Scandinavia, I’ve also sent packs to New Zealand, USA, Canada and even Brazil. Basically anywhere. I’ve been amazed at how the Internet has driven this business forward, it has been simultaneously humbling and terrifying – the world is a very small place these days.</p>

<p><strong>When and where was your last trip?</strong></p>

<p>My last big hike was the Continental Divide Trail, I’ve only just properly gotten over it mentally 🤣. Otherwise I try and get out on day hikes where I can. It’s good for the soul and a great excuse to test backpacks.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/HE3707" title="Tom Gale, Atom Packs"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1737/28856276898_7ba145f6aa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Tom Gale, Atom Packs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>And where is your dream trip taking you?</strong></p>

<p>The Te Araroa south island was about as happy as I have ever been. It was also the most amount of times I have ever nearly died in a period of time. I’d hike it again in a heartbeat! I’m aiming to go for the Arizona Trail this October but can not figure out if I can stop this runaway train I’m currently sitting on. I guess the dream trip is the next one you are undertaking or the one you are currently on. And there are so many trails! Argh!</p>

<p><strong>Any favourite piece of gear which you always carry with you?</strong></p>

<p>I picked up an <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/msr-blizzard-tent-stakes-tent-stakes/?pid=10239">MSR Blizzard Stake</a> on the CDT and quickly fell in love. They cost $5, weigh 1 oz and I use it for both camping and digging cat holes (because everybody poops). Not only do you feel like you can dig forever but I also put a bit of duct tape on the inside edge and would use it as a water spout to get water out of slow trickling springs, it was amazingly effective!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/5u0449" title="Tom Gale, Atom Packs"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1733/28856277268_8c0927d4bc_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="Tom Gale, Atom Packs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Are you planning to get out for a trip soon, and enjoy the summer in the United Kingdom?</strong></p>

<p>I would like to start a continuous walk around the Wainrwrights, these are 214 fells situated in the Lake District National Park. I doubt I’d be able to do it in one go but I can dream! Otherwise I am determined to hike the AZT in October. There are a load of 200 mile hikes in my vicinity. It’s just having the time!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/3n67QU" title="Tom Gale, Atom Packs"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1747/42680475572_e43c10ea46_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Tom Gale, Atom Packs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Social Media - on which channels is Atom Packs active?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/atom_packs/">@atom_packs on Instagram</a>. I need to get Facebook and Twitter set up properly so watch this space. It’s very distracting though.</p>

<p><strong>Tom, I thank you very mucho for taking the time to answer my questions =) Is there something you would like to add?</strong></p>

<p>I guess I’d like to encourage those who are seeking out their first UL setup go with their gut and not just the status quo. It takes many hundreds, if not thousands, of miles to truly understand what you need and don’t need. Just because you want a pack with a padded hipbelt does not mean you are no longer qualified to call yourself ultralight, no matter what they say on the forums.</p>

<p>Instead of obsessing over gear lists or whatever everyone else is doing, just throw some stuff in a bag and go hiking. If it works for you, keep it, if it’s cheap, even better. There are many thousands of ways to spend many thousands of dollars on gear. The best way to know what works is to go and actually do it yourself and then slowly, piece by piece, replace items for lighter alternatives. Once you understand an items use and, more importantly how you interact with it, then you can make a truly informed decision. Otherwise the danger is buying every piece of gear three or four times before you get it right – and that doesn’t leave you much money for hamburgers and beer. Thanks for your time, see you down the trail ☺</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Northern Ireland, or Ireland in general, is not really a country which you associate with sunshine, 26°C hiking days and long, almost empty beaches and cliff paths. However, to my surprise this was exactly what I encountered on my thru-hike of the Causeway Coast Way!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40750498920/in/dateposted/" title="Cliffs along the Causeway Coast Way"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1732/40750498920_d70abcb72d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cliffs along the Causeway Coast Way" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> <em>This trip was supported by <a href="https://www.tourismireland.com">Tourism Ireland</a> and <a href="https://discovernorthernireland.com">Discover Northern Ireland</a>, additionally I also received a fee for my work.

<p>At home in Vaasa, Finland, I have since six weeks wall-to-wall ☀️ every day, and as I was starting to have an eye on the weather forecasts of Portstweart, Bushmills and Ballycastle, I was happy to see that I will be equally blessed with superb weather during my hike on the Causeway Coast Way in Northern Ireland. So into my carry-on backpack went my Luna Sandals, sunscreen and T-Shirts while the rain pants and jacket stayed at home. I did not regret that decision - maybe the only thing I did regret was that I didn’t apply the sunscreen more often and that I didn’t add a few extra days to explore more of this beautiful part of Ireland.</p>

<p>My detailed trip report will follow in the next weeks, but for now enjoy these B-Roll impressions from the trail and it’s quaint little towns which lay along it. Right now this is still a fairly unknown trail, and while at some points along it you will encounter a lot of people this trail likely will soon be as popular as the Laugavegur Trail in Iceland which is renown for equally stunning scenery.</p>

<p>I arrived in Portstewart late in the afternoon, but the weather was so good - I had to go out and hike to the beach. Which was totally worth it!</p>

<p>The next day I hiked to the Giant’s Causeway, which is World Heritage site and can be very busy. But go there late in the evening or early in the morning and you’ll likely have it to yourself. It’s a mind-boggling beautiful place, and I didn’t plan for enough time there - I feel a photographer wants at least a full day to spend here!</p>

<p>I hiked onwards in the heat, along cliff paths which had me stop every few hundred meters to soak in the landscape which is just breath-taking.</p>

<p>On my last day on the trail the drizzle and clouds made an appearance, and also them I found beautiful and serene. And just like that I finished in Ballycastle, sad that this beautiful hike was already over.</p>

<p><em>I first became aware of <a href="https://www.gramxpert.eu">GramXpert</a> as their Gear popped up in the German Ultraleicht Trekking Forum. Since then their <a href="https://www.trekking-lite-store.com/gramxpert-ultralight-backpack-34-4.html">backpacks</a> and <a href="https://www.trekking-lite-store.com/gramxpert-elite-quilt-apex-267.html">quilts</a> are also sold at the trekking-lite-store.com, and their kit is light and looks good, with some unique solutions. Reason enough to get in touch with the two brothers and hear their story!</em></p>

<p><strong>Maj and Kajo, please briefly introduce yourself and tell us who you are. Since when are you backpacking, and how did you start?</strong></p>

<p>We are two brothers with a passion for anything active and outdoorsy. Hiking is almost folklore in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/09/ultralight-summit-daytrippin.html">Slovenia</a> so we’ve been at it from a very young age. The biggest influence was our father. He regularly took us on multi-day hiking and biking trips when we were kids, and those adventures sparked our interest. We still have fond memories of our first bike tour at the age of 8. It was a 4 day, 120km tour and we rode fully loaded 20” bikes with only 6 gears :) Similar adventures on bike &amp; foot were on the menu every summer vacation since. As we got older we started planning our own trips. They became longer and more challenging and with that came better and more elaborate gear.</p>

<p>Kajo: 
I am interested in many outdoor activities, I am not taking anything as a competitive sport but rather as an adventure. I was into rock climbing for a long time, but lately caving and paragliding got my attention. I am responsible for designing new gear and coordinating custom orders, also the main craftsman and tester. I am also finishing my degree in geotechnical engineering so at the moment I can only work part-time.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/4XkWCU" title="kajo"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/873/41439554545_c026ff7f65_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="kajo" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Maj: My approach when it comes to life is holistic. I’m a trained chef and passionate about nutrition. I’m currently also an assistant coach, a Tuina masseur, and a TCM student. I am also an advocate for animal rights and a promoter of sustainable lifestyle. 
I’m the one that takes care of the bureaucratic side of the business, but I enjoy customer service, various daily tasks and of course sewing.</p>

<p><strong>How often are you outdoors nowadays?</strong></p>

<p>As often as we can be. We are very busy these days, but we always make sure to take some time off and go outside in order to recharge our batteries. We take every opportunity we can to go out, test our prototypes and work out the kinks.</p>

<p><strong>Are you two more of “weekend warriors” or do you have some long distance trips under your belt?</strong></p>

<p>We regularly go on two or three day hikes and one or two week-long trips per year. Too busy for anything longer at the moment. 
We want to experience thru hikes also, we just weren’t able to do it so far. Hopefully sometime in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>Hiking in Finland Readers &amp; me, we are gear-nerds! What is your typical baseweight?</strong></p>

<p>Kajo: It depends, but generally about 3-3.5kg for a 3 season setup. While I am very selective about each individual piece of gear, I never really weigh the total pack or bother with the LW/UL/SUL tags. I also still have quite a bit of room to optimize the setup.</p>

<p>Maj: I have similar base weight as Kajo, but I usually carry heavier food (fresh if possible). Thankfully it counts as a consumable :)</p>

<p><strong>Please tell us where the name “GramXpert” came from, and what it stands for.</strong></p>

<p>As you might expect Gram comes from grams. As for the Xpert, we would never claim to know everything and are always happy to learn more, but we felt like our experience and almost obsessive research of design and materials justified the Xpert part :)</p>

<p><strong>What makes GramXpert different from other cottages?</strong></p>

<p>We really try to keep up with our short lead times, keeping the products at high quality levels and most importantly providing good customer service. Our products are also highly customizable. Each person has different needs and wants and we are always willing to adjust and adapt to every individual’s wishes.</p>

<p><strong>Is GramXpert your full-time job or “just a hobby”?</strong></p>

<p>Maj: A little bit of both. At the moment we are also busy doing a bunch of other things as we mentioned before, so we are not sure if this will be a full time job for both of us. I would like to keep working halftime at GramXpert so I can simultaneously work on other projects, but Kajo will put more effort into it in the future, after he graduates. European market for UL gear is quite small and most people (at least here in Slovenia) are day hikers and tend to sleep in huts. Despite that the business is on a positive trajectory and steadily growing. Our mantra is: “Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life.”</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/N565Z1" title="hike"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/886/41439556645_15d7ae98ed_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="hike" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>GramXpert makes lightweight and stylish quilts, accessories and a backpack. Can you tell us how the idea to start the company emerged and how you see its future?**</p>

<p>It started with us trying to tweak the gear we bought so it would fit our needs. Then we made the first quilts for ourselves and our friends. The key moment was when Kajo’s plan to thru-hike the PCT fell apart due to bureaucratic obstacles. He realized he wouldn’t get the necessary visa in time, so he invested his savings in the company instead.</p>

<p>We’re very enthusiastic and full of ideas and plans for the future. We spend most of our free time thinking about our craft, our mission, and our vision. We’re aware of the areas in which we are lacking, but we always strive to improve. We never want to sacrifice quality in order to get a few extra sales, so while we definitely want to grow and flourish, we plan on doing it strategically.</p>

<p><strong>Any intentions of starting to branch out into other segments, for example offering shelters and bivys?</strong></p>

<p>Yes! Eventually we would like to branch out and offer most items backpackers need. R&amp;D takes a lot of time especially if you want to test the gear thoroughly. Bivys will be available soon. Later we will add some clothing items that are currently in the development phase. Branching out proved to be quite challenging seeing as different gear requires different sewing machine settings, or sometimes an entirely separate machine if you want to do it right. We learned a lot while we were launching our backpacks and we hope we can optimize the process and streamline the workflow in the future. Our workspace is quite limited, we’re currently cramped in a 20 square meter room and this makes some things an impossible task. We would like to produce shelters as well, but first we need to move to a bigger workshop.</p>

<strong>Are there any other cottage manufacturers in Slovenia that you work with?</strong></p>

<p>No, we are not aware of any other similar cottage manufacturers nearby, but we do collaborate with a couple of independent local suppliers.</p>

<p><strong>And are you in touch with other cottage manufacturers in Europe, Japan, Canada, the USA and other places?</strong></p>

<p>Not at the moment, but we are open for collaboration. It might be interesting to work on some joint projects.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/f4NA1h" title="machine"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1756/41439561425_9d0d444413_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="machine" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Your company is still young and already has been getting good reviews and praise from all across Europe. Is business going well?</strong></p>

<p>We’re slowly but surely increasing the visibility and hopefully building a good reputation. We are very happy with how things are going, but it will take a while before everything will run smooth. We’re planning on expanding our product range so we can reach more people, but like we said, quality over quantity.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit how you went about the design process of eLite quilt, and where the inspiration came from?</strong></p>

<p>Kajo: Our past experiences inspire all of our products. The same thing happened with eLite. I remember winter camping a few years ago. Trying to find those tiny cordlocks to completely close the footbox in the middle of the night drove me crazy. As soon as I came home I designed a new quilt with a handy closure. With eLite you can close the footbox in a breeze, even with your gloves on.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/Y99p2E" title="DSC02064new"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1731/41618983844_b022e02cc6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="534" alt="DSC02064new" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Kajo and Maj, we love to be let in on the work-in-progress stuff! What kind of new products are you working on at the moment?</strong></p>

<p>There are many prototypes of different gear in the works and you can certainly expect new and exciting things in the near future. Insulated balaclava and backpack accessories will be out in the upcoming months. We’re also currently testing two bivy models along with a simple rectangular 1P tarp/ ponchotarp.</p>

<p><strong>And are there any new lightweight materials that have you all excited?</strong></p>

<p>Not really, but we’re looking forward to the day when super light and breathable DCF will be available :) 10g/m² or lighter shell fabric for quilts would be really awesome.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/0Q4F5B" title="quilt"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/877/41439559695_e24e189e42_b.jpg" width="963" height="1024" alt="quilt" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>How works the R&amp;D at GramXpert, do you have a need yourself that you try to fix, or do some of your clients inspire you for new products and ask you for solutions to their problems, which then are adopted in the GramXpert line-up?</strong></p>

<p>The “base” products are mostly inspired by our own experiences. We design the prototypes, then incorporate any improvements we might feel are needed. Due to our gear being highly customizable, we can always consult each individual customer and figure out a solution for their specific needs.</p>

<p><strong>Where do your customer come from, and how do they find you?</strong></p>

<p>All over the world, but mostly from Europe. Some find us organically, but it seems that most of our customers discover us through word of mouth.</p>

<p><strong>When and where was your last trip?</strong></p>

<p>We took a two day trip two weeks ago. We hiked through Kamnik-Savinja Alps, mainly because we live nearby, so it was really convenient on top of being gorgeous. Our last week-long trip was last autumn. We did a section hike of Slovenian mountain trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/Q4791o" title="bivy"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1725/41618985814_014999499c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="bivy" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>And where is your dream backpacking trip taking you?</strong></p>

<p>Kajo: My dream backpacking trip is constantly changing. Currently it’s PNT (Pacific-Northwest Trail).</p>

<p>Maj: I enjoy taking short trips all over the world, but if I had to choose, the ultimate backpacking experience would be exploring South America.</p>

<p><strong>Any favourite piece of gear which you always carry with you?</strong></p>

<p>Kajo: That would probably be my wind jacket. It’s super convenient if you are always a bit cold like I am. In the colder seasons I always bring a pair of Climashield pants with me to keep me warm and cozy.</p>

<p>Maj: I also never leave home without my wind jacket, but other than that, I always pack my knife so I can prepare fresh meals.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/wTxzZ5" title="triglav"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1739/41618973534_3f9a6d3d06_b.jpg" width="1024" height="654" alt="triglav" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Are you planning to get out for a trip soon, and enjoy the spring in the Julian Alps?</strong></p>

<p>Our trips are mostly planned a day or two before they actually happen. There is still a lot of snow in the Julian Alps, so we’re focused on other areas at the moment. Our next trip will probably be somewhere in the coastal region. What we really like about Slovenia, and in particular the area near the capital, is that a short 1 hour drive can take you to a sub-mediterranean climate at SW, alpine at NW and continental in the eastern parts of the country. So on a good winter day you can choose between snowshoeing or rock climbing in a T-shirt :)</p>

<p><strong>Social Media - on which channels is GramXpert active?</strong></p>

<p>We’re not very active on social media at the moment, but we plan to change that in the future. We occasionally post on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GramXpert/">Facebook</a> and you can also find us on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gramxpert/">Instagram</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Maj &amp; Kajo, I thank you very much for taking the time to answer my questions =) Is there something you would like to add?</strong></p>

<p>We’re really happy that the ultralight community is growing and supportive when it comes to smaller manufacturers.  Hvala Hendrik for this opportunity to showcase our work, and all the best to you and your readers!</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/sestrals-quilt/">As Tucas Sestrals Quilt</a> is a very light, comfortable and very well made synthetic quilt. It packs small, has little problems with condensation and other sources of moisture, and keeps you toasty at night. Watch the Video to get the full low-down in moving images:</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I received the As Tucas Sestrals Quilt in time for my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/10/impressions-from-the-scottish-cairngorms.html">Cairngorms Traverse</a> last October and have used the quilt on half a dozen trips in the autumn and spring since. Overall it has been slept under for some 14 nights and been used since nine months.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/41397124365/in/album-72157669299782358/" title="Sleeping in the Cairngorms"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/958/41397124365_8491cce6ce_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sleeping in the Cairngorms" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The function of a quilt, like a sleeping bag, is to keep you warm at night. Ideally it is light and packs compact during the day, and is comfortable, easy to use and warm during the night when you are resting.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42298583301/in/album-72157669299782358/" title="Bivy camp in Sipoonkorpi NP"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/950/42298583301_a946a2896b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bivy camp in Sipoonkorpi NP" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The Sestrals packs a bunch of features, here’s the list straight from the As Tucas Website:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is <em>Longer than most quilts</em></li>
  <li>It is <em>Wider than most quilts</em></li>
  <li>It has a <em>Closed footbox</em></li>
  <li><em>Very easy to use</em></li>
  <li>Made from <em>schoeller®-ftc fabric with ecorepel® finish</em></li>
  <li>Uses <em>Climashield® APEX</em> synthetic insulation, available in three weights</li>
  <li><em>Handcrafted in the Pyrenees, Spain</em></li>
  <li>Available in four lengths, two widths and three insulation strengths (for a total of 24 different configurations - without the colour options!)</li>
</ul>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42298586971/in/album-72157669299782358/" title="As Tucas logo patch"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/886/42298586971_75b6398069_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="As Tucas logo patch" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>I have used dozens of (down) quilts and have seen lots of different designs, so it’s hard to see something new. However, I really like that As Tucas uses a schoeller fabric for this quilt, schoeller from Switzerland make some of the best UL fabrics out there, and they’re not just light &amp; functional but also have a solid environmental record.</p>

<p>Oh, and while I’m not 100% sure, I think this quilt qualifies as being Vegan 🌿💚</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The craftsmanship is top-notch. It is a very well designed and manufactured piece of kit and I found nothing to complain about.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>My As Tucas Sestrals Quilt is a Size M with a Regular Width and an Climashield Apex 200 insulation, and weighs 658 g. That is a wee bit heavier than the claimed weight of 625 g but still acceptable.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/41397110345/in/album-72157669299782358/" title="Size comparison"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/976/41397110345_26cbe02531_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Size comparison" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I have used some 18 years ago a light and compact synthetic sleeping bag. It packed about the same size as the Sestrals quilt, but it was nowhere near as warm or easy to use as this quilt. Happily I used it mostly in Central America, where it didn’t get too cold at night! As I started to pay attention to the weight of the gear in my backpack some 10 years ago I quickly switched to a quilt. The advantages for me were just too good to pass up, and it has improved my nights outdoors so much that I would encourage anyone who camps outdoors to try a quilt. The Sestrals Quilt from As Tucas is my first synthetic quilt, and thus far I really enjoy using it.</p>

<p>I love how simple it is constructed and how seams have been kept to a minimum, but at the same time paying attention to useful features like the longer hood. It packs down to a compact package and with some pushing and getting the air out I can pack it down to a size of around 6 l volume (that Helsport drybag it is in on the photos is a 10 l sack). It fluffs out easily when in camp, and condensation and dew do it no harm. I have had in the past some sketchy nights in the mountains when from the really warm day temperatures the thermometer suddenly plummets towards 0°C as soon as the sun sets - in those conditions gear that lays outside immediately starts to accumulate small droplets of water, and I had some uncomfortable nights with down quilts in the past.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28425850028/in/album-72157669299782358/" title="Morning dew on the quilt"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/881/28425850028_0ffdbeace8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Morning dew on the quilt" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With the Sestrals Quilt that is no longer a worry. There’s two fabrics to thank for that: First is the schoeller ftc fabric with the ecorepel finish, which is water repellant and the dew or rain just forms in little drops on the top of the fabric (as seen in the photo above, which I shot during my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/microadventure-sipoonkorpi-national-park.html">Sipoonkorpi Microadventure</a>) and that sweet fabric is also free from fluorocarbons (PFC), so it is not harmful to humans, animals and nature. Secondly, the Climashield APEX insulation is synthetic and does not collapse from moisture, unlike down (Hydrophobic down is another story). I had a down sleeping bag collapse on top of me on a winter trip (I sweated it wet) and that was a very uncomfortable night. Even when the quilt would get wet the insulation would not collapse, so while you still might have an uncomfortable night under a wet synthetic quilt you actually could wring it dry and possibly have a halfway decent sleep (now there’s an idea for a future article!).</p>

<p>But away from such horror scenarios! A quilt for me needs to pack small while I am hiking and be light, and on both accounts the Sestrals quilt convinces. At camp I want to easily unpack it and not need to worry about condensation, where it also scores top marks. And then it obviously needs to be warm, comfortable and easy to use while sleeping. I tuck in the quilt at my sides when I go to sleep, and usually have a leg out to “cool down”. I also turn a lot while sleeping, from my left to my back to my right to my stomach and back, and with a quilt that is no problem. I remember nights in a sleeping bag where I ended up trapped inside because I turned too much, and well, that just ain’t nice. All quilts give you that freedom of movement, and the Sestrals maybe even gives you a little bit more freedom because there’s no drawstrings and straps which can trap you.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42251990132/in/album-72157669299782358/" title="Side view"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/978/42251990132_73498f30bd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Side view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Warmth-wise the Climashield Apex 200 is rated to -5°C Comfort, and I found that a realistic rating. In Scotland we had some cold nights which were around the -2°C mark, and I was toasty under the quilt. I am a very warm sleeper so these kind of ratings are always dependent on the person, your metabolism, and many other factors. If you easily feel cold at night take at minimum the APEX 167 quilt if you want to use it from spring to autumn, or maybe even the APEX 200 if you really, really easily feel cold.</p>

<p>In the morning the quilt dries fast in the sun if some dew collected on it (in black at least), and it is easy to pack up again to a compact package, ready to hike. And while I haven’t washed it yet (it hasn’t seen <em>that</em> much use yet) it should be easy to clean this quilt, just toss it in the washing machine, wash it at 40° and then hang it to dry. No need to send it to a special dry cleaner or throw tennis balls into the dryer, like you have to with a down sleeping bag.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42251988122/in/album-72157669299782358/" title="Back view"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/950/42251988122_a439f03406_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Back view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>The quilt itself is for me pretty much perfect, but I would like that it also comes with a stuff sack or dry bag when you buy it. A spacious storage bag is included, so the absence of a stuff sack for hiking was a bit strange - a cuben dry bag would be perfect!</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>In ultralight backpacking you always try to optimize the gear to the conditions of the trip ahead. The As Tucas Sestrals Quilt is my spring, summer and autumn quilt when the temperatures at night are expected to be around 0°C but can go colder, and when I expect a lot of rain and wet ground. For these trips the Sestrals quilt has performed admiringly and I had never any concerns that I might have a cold night - be it hiking in the rain in Scotland and camping out or on the Microadventure near Helsinki earlier this month. It is light, compact and very easy &amp; comfortable in use, and I like to take it along on most trips as it’s just a very well made piece of kit that I know will perform and which I don’t need to worry about. With that it makes my backpacking trips more relaxing, and I have had great nights of sleep under the quilt. I look forward to take it along on a trip with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/eno-sub6-hammock-review.html">ENO Sub6 Hammock</a> later this summer and see how it works in a hammock 🌳🌲!</p>

<p><em>I know Paul and <a href="http://www.treadlitegear.co.uk">Tread Lite Gear</a> since several years and have interacted with him on Twitter on and off. Paul’s gear gets very good reviews from other bloggers and the wallets I bought from him a few weeks ago are very nice indeed. Paul has found a niche and serves it really well. But enough from me, here’s Paul’s answers!</em></p>

<p><strong>Paul, please briefly introduce yourself and tell us who you are. Since when are you backpacking, and how did you start?</strong></p>

<p>Hello all, Im Paul, im 47 and hail from Coventry in the UK. Its about as central in the UK as you can get and is also about as far as you can get from anywhere interesting to walk. Im married and have a 12 year old daughter. Back in my youth I was in the scouts and my Dad also took me on some hiking trips. I think that’s where my love of all things outdoors started. I suspect like many people life gets busy and you put things on the back burner whilst you chase a career, get married and have a family etc. I started getting back out maybe 10 years ago. At the time Ray Mears was doing his thing and for me it started with bushcraft. I quickly realised that what I really wanted to do was get out in the hills and I started to put away the all the heavy kit and look to ways to lighten my load so I could have a more comfortable journey. I also love to hammock and tend to hang in the winter months. If only there were more forests at altitude.</p>

<p><strong>How often are you outdoors nowadays?</strong></p>

<p>Back when I was in employment I tried to get out at least once a month. After starting the company I was permanently broke and reinvesting everything to get it off the ground so trips were pretty thin on the ground. Last year saw a few health issues that kept me off anything too strenuous but hopefully that’s behind me now and im really looking forward to some proper summit time this year. I have already got two long weekends in the diary for end of May and middle of June. It will be a bit of a shock to my legs im sure!</p>

<p><strong>Are you more of a “weekend warrior” or do you have some long distance trips under your belt?</strong></p>

<p>These days I’m mostly out on the weekends but back in the days when I had paid holidays I did a few longer trips in Norway, Estonia and Scotland. I think Norway is a stunning country, its hard in the UK to enjoy my love of a hammock but combine it with walking any great distance. My first time was just a week walking around the Nordmarka. It was cool to walk out of Oslo station and get the metro to the trail head. Easy walking and trees on top of most peaks made for some great hangs. My other Norway trip was very different as I headed off to Karasjok way up in the arctic circle for a winter trip. Pulling a toboggan along frozen rivers was truly fantastic. The Estonia trip was great too. Another winter getaway to Laheema National Park. Living in a temperate climate I’d never seen the sea frozen so that was pretty cool. Im hoping to do something special for my 50th in a few years so need to get my thinking cap on for a destination. I’m never likely to get the time to do anything epic but maybe I could do a few sections of one of the big American trails. I hear the AT is pretty hammocky so that appeals.</p>

<p><strong>Hiking in Finland Readers &amp; me, we are gear-nerds! What is your typical baseweight?</strong></p>

<p>It is getting there now. Back in the first year of the business I sold pretty much all my high end kit to keep the lights on. At the time it was painful but looking back it did allow me to start with a clean slate. Like most folks I’d learned a lot of lessons over the years about what worked for me and what didn’t so I was able to assemble my ideal kit list as funds permitted. Im at about 4kg base for 3 season ground camping. I recently got hold of a lightly used DCF Khufu from <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2011/01/interview-jotaro-yoshida-from-locus-gear.html">Locus Gear</a> and it’s a really quality bit of kit. The inner I find a little tight on length so I’ve just ordered an EE recon bivy to give a bit more room. My go to pack is an old GG Mariposa, it’s a vintage version in silnylon with acres of external mesh pockets. I don’t like to go into my pack until I hit camp so the mesh works great for stuff I need to access through the day. It’s a bit big for most trips but at just over 500g I’m happy to pack my sleep kit loose to pad it out. I always think its strange when I look at the current model and it weighs nearly double. <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2009/11/interview-glen-van-peski-from-gossamer-gear.html">Gossamer Gear</a>, if you are reading this how about an anniversary special that hits the old weights? A 1.5oz DCF body Mariposa would be my dream pack. I have two so maybe one day I might get busy rebuilding one. My sleep mat is a GG Airbeam XL. Sadly no longer made but I love the extra width over my Neoair. I use a Cumulus 250 quilt from spring through autumn and an EE Enigma 10f for winter. Cooking is a Toaks 850 with titanium cone from Stormin Stove Systems and a Speedster alcohol stove all wrapped up in a Tread Lite bag for 179g total. I own a lot of ti pots but the Toaks is great. I can get a meal and a coffee from one boil and the handles located right at the top means its great in a cone and you don’t get hot handles. I won’t bore you with the whole list, but these are the main ones!</p>

<p><strong>Please tell us where the name “Tread Lite Gear” came from, and what it stands for.</strong></p>

<p>Getting a name was a nightmare! You start off thinking of every word associated with being light only for a quick google to reveal someone got there first. I wanted something that reflected the UL sector I was aiming at but that also covered all the bases and didn’t pigeon hole any future product plans. In the end a short list was quickly whittled to Tread Lite Gear on the basis it was the only one I could get the domain for. I like it though, I think it sums up what the company is about and it rolls off the tongue nicely.</p>

<p><strong>What makes Tread Lite Gear different from other cottages?</strong></p>

<p>I think the main thing would be the focus on just hiking accessories. Most cottages offer a full service from the small stuff right up to packs, shelters and sleep systems. I wanted to be able to offer off the shelf products with no long waiting time to a high standard and at a reasonable price point. It’s a very simple ethos. It’s just me, one guy, one product at a time. I’m small enough that I get to interact with my customers on a more personal level and I think people like that connection, I know I do!</p>

<p>I don’t do mailshots or undertake paid marketing. I wanted to take a very organic approach to growing the business at a pace that was comfortable. I get sick of emails asking me to review my purchase so that’s a feature I’ll never implement on the site. Life is too short. I also took the decision not to give away kit for review. It’s not that im tight, it’s just that I believe a review carries more weight if someone has parted with money to get it.</p>

<p><strong>Is Tread Lite Gear your full-time job or “just a hobby”?</strong></p>

<p>I’m full time. I work long hours but I wouldn’t change it. It’s very rare that it actually feels like work. I get to sit and watch box sets on Prime or Netflix all day while I work. Some people say I’m really a TV critic and sewing is a by-product of the process =) I remember after I finished watching Breaking Bad that I’d love to convert a big camper van into a mobile sewing studio!</p>

<p>I love what I do though. I choose my own hours so there is great flexibility and I find it really rewarding. I think I’m probably unemployable now in the real world and every day I’m thankful that I don’t have to put on a suit, get in a car and drive ridiculous distances at the beck and call of others and tow the line. Its taken me a long time to find what I’m happiest doing and I’d never go back. Paying income tax in one go each year takes some getting used to though!</p>

<p><strong>Tread Lite Gear makes lightweight lanterns and a massive amount of different pockets and bags accessories. Can you tell us how the idea to start the company emerged and how you see its future?</strong></p>

<p>In my old life I was a surveyor. I worked in the public sector for a large funding body providing capital funding for education. I left that to go into private practice on the other side of the table preparing property strategies and funding bids for clients. It was a great job and provided a comfortable life but it was stressful and involved a huge amount of travel and staying away from home. When the credit crunch hit, government funding collapsed. I managed to stay in employment and even started my own consultancy company. Eventually there were too many people chasing too little money and work started to be hard to come by. I kept it going a little too long. Usual story of flogging a dead horse when I should have cut and run. So one day I woke up with a pile of debt and no clue about where I wanted to go next but I knew I needed a change. With little cash to fund my gear I started playing at making my own. I bought a singer 201k sewing machine on ebay for £50 and a knackered MSR Hubba Bubba. I cut up the tent and made some awful looking monstrosities haha! I found I really enjoyed it though and after a few weeks of practice stuff started to look good. I thought the UK market was under represented and had potential so I shut the surveying business, flogged my car to release some funds and started the company. My wife went back to work full time to support us while I slowly set about building the business. Year 1 was really tough and I considered chucking it in more than once but deep down I thought it had the legs to go somewhere. Year 2 was much better and Year 3 finally saw the point where it seemed to start to gather some momentum.</p>

<p>In my mind I thought that summers would be really busy and winters would be quiet allowing me to hike more but it didn’t work like that and I seem to be busy year round. December is probably the only time I get to take a proper rest over Christmas and we usually rent a cottage in Norfolk. Long dog walks on huge beaches with big skies are a family favourite and it’s nice to switch off and relax.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/4e61e4" title="Tryfan Summit"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/952/28376483398_90f46dd160_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Tryfan Summit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I still use the same sewing machine for the majority of my work. It was built in the 1950s and it is still perfect. I like the juxtaposition of sewing space age fabrics on an old machine. I do have a bit of a habit of picking up more Singer 201s. There are 8 in the loft as we speak. A good investment though as prices are going through the roof.</p>

<p>The future is something im thinking about now a lot. Im about at the limit of what one guy can do in a small workshop. I think I’ll tough it out this year but next year I’m going to need some bigger premises and maybe some staff if growth continues. I have a largish garden and would have loved to construct a workshop but alas it’s a big investment so I’ll end up leasing I think. Expansion brings all sorts of extra hassle and more risk but we’ll cross that bridge when we get there.</p>

<p><strong>Any intentions of starting to branch out into other segments, for example offering backpacks or stoves?</strong></p>

<p>I don’t see it but I never say never. There are a few barriers that make it difficult. The UK has lost much of its fabric manufacturing base over the years and the type of materials customers want need to be imported. Packs, and shelters in particular use huge swathes of fabric and I’m not in a position to import tons of fabric at costs that make the economics work. My workshop is pretty compact too which means I don’t have the space for a huge cutting table. Watch the Workshop tour Video to get an idea:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BhC3Rm9cAd0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In the short time I’ve been doing this I’ve seen many cottages go to the wall or have huge problems. The online communities are full of stories of people folding and still taking money from people for gear that doesn’t arrive. They always seem to be big ticket items where payment is taken up front and lead times can be huge. There are some very sad stories behind some of these situations and whilst you can empathise, I never want to be in the position of needing to take up front payment or suddenly having a workload that is out of control. Life throws things at you that you have to deal with and always at a time that is inconvenient. Although people cut cottages a lot of slack, when all said and done it’s a business and, you need to act accordingly and fulfil your obligations. For that reason if I ever did branch out into big ticket stuff I would only sell what I could put on the shelf.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any other cottage manufacturers in the United Kingdom that you work with?</strong></p>

<p>Not at this time.</p>

<p><strong>And are you in touch with other cottage manufacturers in Europe, Japan, Canada, the USA and other places?</strong></p>

<p>Not really although there are often interactions on social media.</p>

<p><strong>Your company is now three years old has been getting good reviews and praise from all across Europe. Is business going well?</strong></p>

<p>Yes it’s good. Cash is always tight but each year gets a little easier. I launched the website this year so that’s brought a new dimension to things. I kind of thought that ebay sales would subside as the web became more popular but ebay seems to continue to grow as does the website. In time I hope to get off ebay as it’s a terribly expensive platform to sell on and they are making it more and more admin intensive and bureaucratic for businesses. Im already introducing lines that won’t go on ebay.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/M5E9UJ" title="Packing Cells"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/967/42203326782_192201d601_b.jpg" width="1024" height="961" alt="Packing Cells" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit how you went about the design process of Chest Pack / Front Pouch, and where the inspiration came from?</strong></p>

<p>The chest pack in itself is very simple in its construction. I’d always liked the idea of a chest pouch and it’s something that customers asked for a lot. Reaching for side pockets can be a pain so it is nice to have somewhere easy to get to. The problem was always attachment to the pack. I’d tried some commercial versions in the past like the OMM trio and a Salomon one and always found them hard to mount to my pack and the weights were poor. I tried a few prototypes of my own but never quite got something that I thought would be a universal fit. The current model seems to tick those boxes and feedback has been great.</p>

<p><strong>Paul, we love to be let in on the work-in-progress stuff! What kind of new products are you working on at the moment?</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned in another question im about at the limit of my time so I don’t have anything major planned. As I write this I’ve finally added cuben packing cells in a few sizes to the website which I’d only ever done previously on a custom basis. My focus over the summer will be weeding out the stuff that’s not really cutting it on the rosta, improving some of the photography and getting more pictures of gear in use whilst expanding some of the options on stuff that’s already there. My time outdoors is precious to me and I hate taking work out with me but I do appreciate studio photos are not as nice as stuff pictured on the hill. I seldom take a camera out with me. It’s too easy to live trips looking through a lens so I tend to just drink it in. I am also a little camera shy.</p>

<p>I’d also like to get a budget range of gear up on the website too as I’m always conscious that we don’t all have unlimited funds to splash out with. It is hard though as the labour costs and overhead are the same no matter what the fabric cost.</p>

<p><strong>Any new lightweight materials that have you all excited?</strong></p>

<p>Not really, DCF (I still prefer the <em>cuben</em> name) is still really the benchmark and I don’t see anything to challenge it in the near future. I see lots of new, heavier weight fabrics that I like though, particularly from the racing sail side of the industry, but obviously their UL appeal is limited. I’m not a huge fan of the recreational lite skin for instance but some of the racing sail lite skin laminates are beautiful.</p>

<p><strong>How works the R&amp;D at Tread Lite Gear, do you have a need yourself that you try to fix, or do some of your clients inspire you for new products and ask you for solutions to their problems?</strong></p>

<p>I think it’s a mixture. UL hikers are very knowledgeable. I mean we all spend hours on end looking for solutions and looking at Gucci kit to shave a few more g’s and for sure customers are your biggest asset when it comes to product development. You can’t make every customer suggestion work due to practicalities or economics but you can often implement small changes that make gear more useable. A good exampIe would be the roll top camera strap pocket which came into being after it was requested by Ed and Robin on the trek lite forum. Took me a while to get something I was happy with but they are very popular now.</p>

<p>I’m always kicking around ideas with the guys I walk with too. On my last trip to the Lakes I was testing a new UL rechargeable cuben lantern. Rich and Chiseller quickly made a few suggestions to improve the design and it was on sale the following week. Cheers chaps!</p>

<p>I do love doing something new as it breaks up the routine. I have a list of stuff that I’d like to make or develop when time permits. Some of that is customer driven and some are my own musings on gaps in my lineup.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/CfGa2r" title="Haweswater"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/964/28376482518_d2d96d62a2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Haweswater" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Where do your customer come from, and how do they find you?</strong></p>

<p>Last financial year 66% of sales were in the UK and 34% overseas. USA and Germany are about equal as the biggest overseas markets but I ship pretty much everywhere there is a reliable postal service. The UK decision to leave the EU has had a big impact on the strength of Sterling and it has been good for exports. It’s a double edged sword though with most of my input costs being in Dollars or Euros. I’m nervous about the deal that will be put in place post Brexit. It all seems a bit of a mess currently but hopefully it will get hashed out. Whatever happens I guess you just have to adapt. Filling in customs paperwork is already the bane of my life so I hope there isn’t a need for more of it. Politics eh? Its enough to make you go hiking =)</p>

<p>I’m on social media and forums so that is a big pathway to my door. I’ve been lucky to have some exposure from other areas which I’ll mention later if I may. Ebay and Google are probably a big route too.</p>

<p><strong>When and where was your last trip?</strong></p>

<p>Ennerdale in the Lake District late March for a couple of nights in the hammock. It was dry too. That’s probably my last low level camp this year. It is time to get some high level stuff in, get my fitness back and escape the midge season!</p>

<p><strong>And where is your dream backpacking trip taking you?</strong></p>

<p>I was recently chatting to a Norwegian customer who is about to embark on a trip from the far SW of Norway right up to North Cape (3000km). It’s not a recognised trail but of all the backpacking I’ve done in Norway just makes me glow inside. I think some of that has to do with the great company of people I went with, the warm welcome from local people we met as well as the great beauty of the place. So yea I reckon something similar.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/47Kg3J" title="At the Summit!"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/964/28376483258_412a7231e4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="At the Summit!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Any favourite piece of gear which you always carry with you?</strong></p>

<p>Too many! I love my little cuben lanterns and there is one clipped to all my shelters and hammocks. They weigh very little and its nice not to burn the battery on my head torch in camp and it saves the need to carry a spare cell. I’m a coffee fuelled entity too so my little cuben coffee caddy bag is something that sees a lot of use. Other stuff I’m never without is my Zebralight head torch. It has never let me down. My swing lite flex brolly, my old school Mariposa pack and a Fenix 5 watch for route tracking and data. I never thought an Umbrella would be something I’d take but it’s surprisingly useful and hey it is orange! I do like bright colours and own very little stuff in earthy tones. Top of my wish list is the new Garmin Inreach Mini. I seldom have a phone signal when hiking so it would be nice to text the wife to tell her I’m alive once in a while. I’ll wait a while and see what people think of it in use.</p>

<p><strong>Are you planning to get out for a trip soon, and enjoy the spring in the United Kingdom?</strong></p>

<p>Yes indeed. Lake District end of May and middle of June. May to meet up with a few mates and June to meet some of the friends I’ve never met from the excellent <a href="http://trek-lite.com/index.php">Trek-Lite.com forum</a>. After that I’d like to get over to Snowdonia for a few trips. I like my mountains craggy and gnarly. Tryfan and the Glyders are a favourite.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media - on which channels is Tread Lite Gear active?</strong></p>

<p>I am on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/treadlitegear/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Treadlitegear/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/@treadlitegear">Twitter</a> for work and active on the Trek-Lite.com forum which I try to keep for more personal enjoyment although work does creep in as you’d expect. I recently culled a lot of the Facebook groups I’m active on a personal level as my feed was just solid hiking related and sometimes it’s nice to see what my family and friends are up to. I read BPL from time to time but I prefer smaller more close knit places. Hammock forums is somewhere I visit too and Reddit occasionally as I’m not mad on the interface although the content is good. I probably spend too much time online but most of the people I hike with I met through online community meetups. I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone I didn’t get on with and it’s always nice to put a face to a name.</p>

<p><strong>Paul, I thank you very much for taking the time to answer my questions =) Is there something you would like to add?</strong></p>

<p>Well firstly thanks for reaching out to do the interview Hendrik. I’ve been lucky to have a lot of other people help in getting my name out there too so I would like to also offer them some thanks if that’s OK.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theoutdoorsstation.co.uk/2017/01/no-424-tread-lite-gear/">Bob Cartwright at the Outdoor Station</a> interviewed me last year which I really enjoyed and definitely had a positive impact on the business. To <a href="http://www.christownsendoutdoors.com">Chris Townsend</a> and the <a href="https://www.tgomagazine.co.uk">TGO Magazine</a> team who recently did a feature which has again given a boost to things and rather impressed my daughter at the same time. She took great delight in going to buy a copy and then texting pictures to everyone.</p>

<p>Thanks also to all the people on Facebook, Twitter, Insta, blog writers and Youtubers who share my posts and mention my products - many of whom have become friends!</p>

<p>My wife deserves special praise for her support, allowing me to steal away time working when I should be spending it with the family and yet still encouraging me to get out and hike.</p>

<p>Last but no means least, my customers. I get tons of messages offering thanks and encouragement. You keep the dream alive! It is deeply appreciated!</p>

<p>Happy Trails,</p>

<p>Paul</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Finland, Sweden and Norway we have plenty of 🌳🌲🌲🌳🌲🌲🌳🌳🌲🌲🌲, a logical conclusion is thus to carry a hammock when you want to relax in the forest! In the past hammocks have been bulky, heavy and difficult to set up - that is not the case if you carry the ultralight ENO Sub6 Hammock and the amazing ENO Helios Suspension System. They let you lay in your hammock in less than two minutes on your next backpacking trip or day hike - reason enough for me to check them out!</p>

<p>I have tried several hammocks over the last years, but never really fell in love with them. Either they were too bulky, too uncomfortable or just too troublesome to set up. That changed as the <a href="https://www.partioaitta.fi/shop/eagle-nest-outfitters-sub6-hammock-1005617-charcoal/">Sub6 Hammock</a> and the <a href="https://www.partioaitta.fi/shop/eagle-nest-outfitters-helios-suspension-system-1005620-grey/">Helios Suspension System</a> from <a href="https://www.partioaitta.fi/tuotemerkit/eagle-nest-outfitters/">Eagle Nest Outfitters</a> arrived at Hiking in Finland HQ. At first I couldn’t believe how tiny and light the hammock and tree straps were, so I went out in the garden to see if they really work.</p>

<p>Well, they do! I came back in, showed them to my wife (who loves hammocks!) and told her that I got a nice hammock in which she can relax the next time we go on a day hike or visit the beach. She too couldn’t believe how light and compact they were, but after another demonstration in the garden she was convinced! <em>“So how light are they?”</em> you might be wondering. Well, according to my scale the Sub6 Hammock is 163 g including the Stuff Sack, and the Helios Suspension System is 123 g total, that’s 5 g for the stuff sack and 58 g per strap. Together they are 286 g, which is pretty amazing in my books!</p>

<p>Since then I had the hammock along on some bike rides and day hikes and was always again amazed at how light and how easy to set up this combo is. That alone means it’s almost a no-brainer to take these two along instead of a sit pad, as they are smaller than a 500 ml water bottle (in Fact they are so small that I sometimes need to rummage through my backpack to find them =). It now takes me less than two minutes to put up the hammock to the trees and lay down in it, and after some practicing I also have it down to operate the stove from the hammock and prepare the coffee while chilling! It adds a whole new layer of relaxation in nature to my hikes, and I have found myself napping in the shade of the trees while the wind plays with the leafs far above me.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42175346741/in/dateposted/" title="Boiling water from the hammock"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/968/42175346741_2d7f8f5f84_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Boiling water from the hammock" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42175359321/in/dateposted/" title="Lots of awesome ENO kit"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/910/42175359321_4cc61b34fd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lots of awesome ENO kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But that ain’t all: ENO makes everything you would need for hammocking, including an underquilt so you don’t get cold, the Underbelly Gear Sling which is a Mini-Hammock for your backpack &amp; gear, a bug net to keep the Mosquitos out and a Tarp which keeps you dry. That means if you fall in love with hammocking after you’ve had the Sub6 along on some day hikes and feel like you want to sleep in it, you now can add the gear you need and are ready for sleeping elevated in the forest! I have a bunch of ENO hammocking gear here and plan to try hammock camping again this summer, and I have a feeling that I will like it much better this time around.</p>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong> it is safe to say that for day trips in the forest and afternoons at the beach we have a tiny &amp; light addition to the backpack with the ENO Helios Suspension System and the Sub6 Hammock. They are easy to put up, so very comfortable to chill in and don’t need a lot of space in the backpack. And with all the 🌲🌲🌳🌲🌲🌲🌳🌲 we have here in Finland it’s about time we elevate ourselves from the ground! If you’d like to try the Sub6 Hammock and Helios Suspension System yourselves, head over to <a href="https://www.partioaitta.fi/tuotemerkit/eagle-nest-outfitters/">Partioaitta</a> who carry the gear here in Finland!</p>

<p>Last week I was going to Helsinki for <a href="https://pingfestival.fi">PING Festival 2018</a> and I decided to sneak in a wee Microadventure in <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/en/sipoonkorpinp">Sipoonkorpi National Park</a> before the event. Sipoonkorpi is a new-ish National Park and less than an hour by bus away from the centre of Helsinki, so it makes for an excellent place to escape the city for a while and enjoy this unique park with its forests, hills and beautiful nature. If you prefer Video over photos and want to see some enchanting Drone Footage, relaxed hiking and me brushing my teeth just hit play:</p>

<p>I took the train to Helsinki, a great way to do some work and watch the latest Episode of Neo Magazine Royale, and then jumped on the Tram to the Clarion Helsinki to drop of the stuff I needed for the following few days in Helsinki and Ruka. Then it was off with the Bus to Sipoonkorpi National Park, which lays on the outskirts of Vantaa, one of the three cities which makes up the Helsinki Metropolitan area. I got off in the middle of nowhere at a scenic road. I followed the sign to the Tractor Museum and then just walked down the road where I saw the blue “Sipoonkorpi National Park” sign. Shortly after I saw the Luontopolku sign, this trail can be walked in either direction but as it was early in the day and I had an idea where I wanted to sleep and what I wanted to see when I followed the trail first north.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42144268101/in/dateposted/" title="Entering the National Park"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/830/42144268101_25ab3fb891_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Entering the National Park" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40337492750/in/dateposted/" title="And there&#x27;s the Nature Path!"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/907/40337492750_bcf8920e3b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="And there&#x27;s the Nature Path!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40337484140/in/dateposted/" title="Wood Anemone"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/964/40337484140_6437bfc456_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Wood Anemone" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Right away I loved the little trail - Wood Anemone were everywhere along the narrow trail which went through a very young forest which was beautiful, and then one got a first taste of the granite slick rocks which I later see a lot in the Högberget section of the trail. This section was short and after a short while I was out on the forest road again, before entering a more shaded pine forest on the other side. This section ended also again in that same forest road, and then the trail went on the road further till a parking lot where quite a few cars were parked and a few boulderers where just shouldering their crashpads to go hug some pebbles in the National Park’s surroundings. I followed the trail towards the Kalkkiruukki Laavu, which was very busy with day hikers grilling sausages and enjoying the fantastic warm weather.</p>

<p>I sat down for an hour or so, drunk a coffee and shot some video scenes, and complained on Instagram that my NEW Katadyn BeFree 1l bottle was apparently already broken as I got it (<a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel/status/996281448062705664">see it here on Twitter</a>). I packed up and then the trail continued for a few kilometres through dark pine forests, past rocks, climbing up and down and over streams. The path was wide and great condition, and here and there one could see where the winter XC trail goes. I had a chat with two women who where hiking with their dog and inquired about Ticks, and according to them these little pests are not a problem here (I didn’t encounter any).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/41423898904/in/dateposted/" title="Only a short stroll to Högberget"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/825/41423898904_bcb18926b9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Only a short stroll to Högberget" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/41423901054/in/dateposted/" title="Högberget from above!"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/828/41423901054_08a0cfefe6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Högberget from above!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>And then I arrived at Högberget! These are probably the most popular spot of the National Park, I saw a lot of people here, enjoying the view from the higher rocks towards the city and sea beyond (I didn’t see the Baltic, but it should be possible to see it on a clear day). These slick granite rocks are really nice and I decided that I wanted to sleep under the stars somewhere over there, though as there was no water close by I first needed to find a water source - and I wanted to finish the trail before looking for a place to sleep. As the days are long in Finland now - the sun sets somewhere around 22:30 - I had enough time to do everything, and still could find a nice spot to roll out my mat &amp; quilt and have something to eat.</p>

<p>I slept shortly that night - because I got up at 1:00 o’clock to photograph the stars, and low-and-behold, I got very lucky as I even captured some Northern Lights! In May! The next morning I slept in as long as I could before the sun was just too warm, made breakfast, shot a video about the As Tucas Sestrals quilt and then ran back to the Bus stop to catch the Bus back to Helsinki - I had a Design Tour to attend and didn’t want to meet that!</p>

<p>All in all it was a fantastic little trip: Beautiful warm T-Shirt weather, stars and Northern Lights, beautiful nature and lots of fresh green on the ground and trees! If you come to Helsinki, Espoo or Vantaa (or life there!) and have an extra day, do it like me: Take along your Ultralight backpack, some food and hop on the Bus to Sipoonkorpi National Park!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-there--what-you-need">How to get there &amp; what you need</h2>

<p>I took Bus 717A from next to the Helsinki Railway Station to Sotunki, Google Maps or the Reittiopas Website are recommended to find the times when the bus goes and see where you have to get off (which is <em>Kalkkiuunintie</em> and should be displayed in the Bus, too). From there follow the sign which says <em>Trollberga</em> and <em>Traktori- ja Konemuseo</em> and after around 250 m you’ll see the blue Sipoonkorven Kansallispuito sign above. From the bus stop the complete nature path is around 8 km in length, and you can hike it either direction. A water bottle and some snacks are recommended for a day trip, if you want stay for the night bring a mattress, quilt and bivy which are appropriate for the season, and possibly a tarp or tent if you do not want to stay in one of the lean-to shelters. <strong>Questions?</strong> Ask me on Twitter of Facebook!</p>
