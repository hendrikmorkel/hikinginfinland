    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It‚Äôs white outside here in Vaasa and much of the Northern Hemisphere, and inevitably my mind turns towards skiing! At the moment the next trip towards snow-covered mountains is still a wee bit off, but telling you about my last trip to Vorarlberg with Bj√∂rn makes the waiting time more enjoyable - and helps you plan your own visit to the secret spot of Warth-Schr√∂cken!</p>

<p>You like winter? The sound of crunching snow under your soles, the crisp cold air of the mountains blowing in your face, your breath visible in the minus temperatures and fresh snow on the hills sounds like Paradise to you? Then you probably are as excited about the winter season as me! Lets kick this trip report off with a visual feast from <a href="https://www.warth-schroecken.at">Warth-Schr√∂cken</a> in the Bregenzerwald Region of Vorarlberg, Austria.</p>

<p>These tiny villages lie just across the Border from Germany, but even when they are close to Germany it‚Äôs not too easy to get there so it has remained a <a href="https://www.warth-schroecken.at/en/winter/ski-area/interactive-ski-map-at-glance.html">calm ski area</a>, but with over 300 km of ski slopes, 15 cable cars and 45 chair lifts it‚Äôs easy to get up the mountain - and there are also connections to the <a href="https://www.skiarlberg.at/en/Warth-Schroecken/Live-info/Cable-cars-lifts-ski-runs">Ski Arlberg</a> ski area, which has close to hundred lifts and hundreds of kilometres of slopes for you to explore. Overall there‚Äôs enough possibilities here for one to stay for a week and never ski the same slope twice. And if groomed slopes are not your cup of tea, then rest assured - there‚Äôs plenty of skitouring and lift-assisted skiing off-piste possible in Warth-Schr√∂cken - just make sure you have your <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/ortovox-rescue-set-diract-eu-lvs-geraete-set/?pid=10239">‚àû safety equipment</a> along and know how to use it!</p>

<p><a href="https://st-bergweh.de">Bj√∂rn</a> and me spent a long weekend in the region, with three days on the hills and slopes. Out first day we spent with a local legend, Olympia Gold-Medal Winner Hubert Strolz. The idea was to do the Pfarrer-M√ºller-Ski-Tour together, but conditions were not perfect and so Hubert, Bj√∂rn and me explore the local powder hills in vicinity of the lifts.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a great morning and afternoon that we spend together, the three of us, and Hubert has many tips for us what to explore during the next couple of days. It‚Äôs starting to get dark when we say good bye to Hubert, head a final time together up with the chair lift and ride back down to our Hotel. It‚Äôs tempting to go and have a drink, but Bj√∂rn and me are even more tempted by the Spa area in our Hotel, with the different Saunas!</p>

<h2 id="skitouring-around-warth-schrcken">Skitouring around Warth-Schr√∂cken</h2>

<p>The next morning we decide to do some lift-assisted off-piste skiing - a fresh layer of ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è makes this a very nice way to explore the ski area while not needing to put on the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/contour-hybrid-pure-115-skifelle/?pid=10239">‚àû Contour skins</a> and hiking up the mountains. The sun comes out, together with some blue sky, and Bj√∂rn and me are really enjoying the pretty views and great snow just besides the groomed slopes.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/33258207858/in/album-72157676608367497/" title="Taking in the view"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7922/33258207858_4578886786_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Taking in the view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Shredding through the powder with screams of joy, we take the lifts up again and again, happy about the great weather and conditions. Our common friends <a href="https://www.instagram.com/posayshirts/">Nina</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dirkofposay/">Dirk</a> saw that we are in the area, and as they life here over the winter they suggest to meet up for an afternoon of skiing. Bj√∂rn and me take the Gondola over to the Lech-Z√ºrs ski area - we have a ski pass which allows us to use the lifts in the whole area - where we meet Nina &amp; Dirk - though as it‚Äôs past noon we all feel lunch is in order, so we head to one of the many restaurants on the slopes.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46410111084/in/album-72157676608367497/" title="Cabin Views"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7917/46410111084_729752ee44_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Cabin Views" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With renewed vigour the four of us ski in the sunshine, laughing together, while Dirk and Nina share stories from local adventures in these pretty mountains. In the afternoon we decide to head up to the start of the Pfarrer-M√ºller-Ski-Tour, but after some tests of the slopes we decide together it‚Äôs better to head back down the way we came and enjoy the Powder Snow there.</p>

<p>And so we finish our second day in Warth-Schr√∂cken, which we end once more in the Sauna of our Hotel and with a tasty vegetarian dinner!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51734738161/in/album-72157676608367497/" title="Ski Station Warth"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51734738161_5f7548d19b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Ski Station Warth" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The next day the Weekend starts, and it‚Äôs a lot more busy than it was the previous days. Additionally, in Warth grey clouds hang above us, so we decide to head again over to the Arlberg with our combined Skipass, which gives us access to hundreds of lifts and slopes. And see there - over on the other side of the mountains we find blue sky and sunshine!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51734738336/in/album-72157676608367497/" title="Which Run?!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51734738336_71ac67ef3c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Which Run?!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46410108564/in/album-72157676608367497/" title="Never Without"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7909/46410108564_0456c00162_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Never Without" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We ski on the slopes and off-piste, finding some pockets of untracked powder, which on this busy Saturday is rather nice. Sadly our luck with the weather doesn‚Äôt hold too long, and soon also in Lech-Z√ºrs the clouds hang above us. Ah well, there‚Äôs no bad weather - just bad clothing, and so we continue to ski and enjoy the good conditions on the slopes - and the tasty food in the Restaurants!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51735383079/in/album-72157676608367497/" title="Germnkn√∂del!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51735383079_e5e61f91a9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Germnkn√∂del!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As we haven‚Äôt been to the village of Schr√∂cken just yet, we decide to ski the long run to the village and take the local Ski Bus back to Warth. On the way beautiful wooden cabins stand alone under a blanket of snow, and we also find some more untracked powder runs!</p>

<p>Back in Warth we head up the mountain for one final run - one final run down to Warth, the small village which lays in a deep valley, with so many great ski mountains around it!</p>

<h2 id="getting-there">Getting there</h2>

<p>Warth-Schr√∂cken is a <em>‚ÄúSecret Spot‚Äù</em> because it isn‚Äôt so easy to get there with public transportation. When Bj√∂rn and me where looking at going there from Munich with Public Transportation there were some options, but it was much easier to rent a car and drive there. So that is what I would recommend too, if you want to travel there the fastest way possible - for us it was actually more important to be in a timely fashion back in Munich at the Airport and Railway Station to catch our plane and train back north. If you don‚Äôt have such time pressure, then you can check via <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/6N4k9ExzSS8aSm3B9">Google Maps</a> the Options available with Public Transportation to Warth-Schr√∂cken.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51734972278/in/album-72157676608367497/" title="Walserstube Hotel"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51734972278_a4e4523f0f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Walserstube Hotel" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="where-to-stay">Where to stay</h2>

<p>We stayed at the wonderful <a href="https://www.walserstube.at/de/lieblingsplatz.html">Hotel Walserstube</a> in Warth, a ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Hotel with very beautiful and comfortable rooms, a magnificent Spa area and tasty breakfast and dinner. Bj√∂rn and me shared a spacious room with a balcony and a great view, and what is very great about the Walserstube is also that it‚Äôs just across the street from the Lift Station and a Bus Stop. Overall a great place to stay and I can‚Äôt wait to return there in the future.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/33258201308/in/album-72157676608367497/" title="Darkness over Schr√∂cken"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7823/33258201308_f26e8f097d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Darkness over Schr√∂cken" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="should-you-go-definitely">Should you go? Definitely!</h2>

<p>Warth-Schr√∂cken has been everything I thought it would be - and more. Friendly locals, a superb skiing infrastructure and easy off-piste possibilities next to the slopes, with great powder snow. Add in many different possibilities of sleeping, eating and enjoying the village - you also can go winter hiking and sledding here, amongst other things - and it‚Äôs easy to see why people who have once visited Warth-Schr√∂cken continue to come back to it!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the early Autumn I made a trip to Switzerland, where I not only made over a dozen new friends but also got to explore with Visit Switzerland &amp; the Adventure Travel &amp; Trade Association the sustainable adventure travel possibilities of Ticino, the Valais, Andermatt and Interlaken Regions! Here are some impressions to make you wanna pack your bags &amp; hop on a train to Switzerland üá®üá≠</p>

<p>As usual this is just a photographic feast of my most recent trip, to get you in the mood for planning a visit to Switzerland. I will follow it up with more in-depth articles of the visit, and show you what kind of great hikes and adventures you can have in the Ticino, Andermatt, Valais and Interlaken areas! Lets start in Ticino - the sunny southern part of Switzerland, where Italian is spoken by a majority and you find an Mediterranean environment and usually lots of sun - unless you have a bit of no-luck with the weather, and it‚Äôs raining the whole time! Nevertheless, that‚Äôs not a problem for us outdoor people - <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/200-g-hardshell-montane-podium-pull-on-and-pants.html">hardshell on</a> and outside!</p>

<p>Truth be told, after some rainy days in Bellinzona, Locarno and the Maggia Valley I also experienced an absolutely beautiful morning in the Balvona Valley, where we hiked through many picturesque villages before taking the Postbus and local trains back to Bellinzona.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51704814432/in/album-72157720231166005/" title="Cascata di Foroglio"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51704814432_d1574cbbbf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="682" alt="Cascata di Foroglio" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The visit to Andermatt also started off wet, with plenty of rain, and continued the next day with climbing a Via Ferrata in the rain and mist, before exploring a ‚ÄúCairngorn-esque‚Äù Valley (that‚Äôs what it looked like in the clouds üòÜ) on some sweet eMTBs with Jessie and Fredrik. Our final day in Andermatt we got to see the small village in the sun, and it looked fantastic, to say the least!</p>

<p>On this trip we only used public transportation, so the fantastic Swiss trains - punctual, clean, and a joy to ride in. Especially in the Glacier Express with it‚Äôs large windows!</p>

<p>In love I felt with Saas-Fee and it‚Äôs amazing views - add in that this is a car-free village, and I am considering moving there! We arrived there in the evening by Postbus, and then had something very typical Swiss: Raclette üßÄ!</p>

<p>The Postbus took us to Leukerbad, another small village with impressive views, as it is surrounded by 900 m high rock walls. Here you can find Thermal Springs and the longest Via Ferrata of the Alps.</p>

<p>A beautiful morning hike took us up the Gemmipass and to Sunnb√ºel in the Canton of Bern. Here we continued our trip via Kandersteg, an ice-climbing Mecca in winter, to Interlaken. In this pretty town you can experience various kinds of adventurous activities, from Paragliding to Kayaking and Bungee-Jumping, or simply make a trip up the Jungfraujoch!</p>

    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com//2021/11/retyre-gravel-chaser-skins-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last spring I installed the last time new tires on my Pelago Stavanger Bike - the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/07/switching-tires-never-again-thanks-to-retyre.html">reTyre One</a> tires, which are compatible with a variety of reTyre Skins. During the past months I rode the Gravel Chaser Skin whenever the asphalt stopped and the off-road adventures started, and these skins gave me confidence when cornering and great grip in uneven surfaces.</p>

<p>I want to start off with something I wrote in the late spring: <em>The skins and the reTyre One have zippers which allows you to connect the Skin - and there‚Äôs four different Skins available for different cycling needs - to the <a href="https://rty.re/3yCIarN">reTyre One</a>. The reTyre One itself is a fully functional bicycle tire but with the different Skins you‚Äôre able to put on a new ‚ÄúTire‚Äù onto your bike without the hassle of actually switching the tire. Zipping on a Skin takes me about two Minutes and it‚Äôs even quicker taking it off. It‚Äôs a great way to adapt the bike to different terrains and seasons - zip on the Winter Traveler Skin as soon as the snow starts falling, and take them off in spring.</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51689307540/in/dateposted/" title="reTyre Gravel Chaser Skin"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51689307540_098e604059_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="reTyre Gravel Chaser Skin" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51689303180/in/dateposted/" title="reTyre Gravel Chaser Skin Box"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51689303180_d1e326e08c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="reTyre Gravel Chaser Skin Box" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This still holds true and it is such a great invention as it makes my life as the bicycle-tire-changing person in our family so much easier (I still have to switch the tires on my son‚Äôs <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/07/woom-off-off-review.html">woom OFF AIR bike</a> üòí). Financially speaking it is also a bit cheaper to own a set of <a href="https://rty.re/3yCIarN">reTyre One tires</a> and Skins according to your need than two sets of summer and winter tires (a set of our good winter tires costs easily 120 ‚Ç¨ and the same I usually pay for good summer tires), wheras a set of reTyre On + e.g. a Set of <a href="https://rty.re/3yCIarN">Winter Traveler Skins</a> would be 170 ‚Ç¨ - so around 70 ‚Ç¨ cheaper. The main benefit for me is, however, the amount of time saved. I can not stress this enough, it really makes the procedure so much faster, it‚Äôs wonderful.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51689085354/in/dateposted/" title="reTyre Gravel Chaser Skin Inside"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51689085354_c8d647001c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="reTyre Gravel Chaser Skin Inside" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51688675308/in/dateposted/" title="Zipping on the reTyre Gravel Chaser Skin"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51688675308_958c154f12_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Zipping on the reTyre Gravel Chaser Skin" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <a href="https://rty.re/3hhzjpx">Gravel Chaser</a> Skin was just as easy to zip on as the Winter Traveler Skin, even if the reTyre One was a bit dirty. I guess if you‚Äôre concerned about the zipper getting stuck you could clean the tire with some <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/muc-off-pit-kit-8-in-one-reinigungsset/?pid=10239">‚àû Muc-Off products</a> but I didn‚Äôt bother at all and they went on without a hassle in a minute. There‚Äôs a wee gap between the ends of the skin but during riding I did not feel it at all, so it wasn‚Äôt a problem.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51689311020/in/dateposted/" title="Zipper on the reTyre Gravel Chaser Skin"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51689311020_d41d1c6fa0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Zipper on the reTyre Gravel Chaser Skin" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The most important aspects of a tire is for me that it has grip and is long-lasting. I can‚Äôt comment on the longevity of the Gravel Chaser yet, but the grip has been very good. It has brillant grip on gravel roads and muddy forest paths, and they give me great confidence when I go through muddy or rocky bends in the trails and roads. Thanks to the higher shoulder knobs on the tire you have more control on uneven surfaces, and I had not slip my tires once during my rides. At the same time it has a fast-rolling centre tread, which means you can get some nice speed with them when you feel like it. It‚Äôs a great addition to the reTyre line-up for those of us who like to go bikepacking and ride gravel roads!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51689295470/in/dateposted/" title="Top-Side View of the reTyre Gravel Chaser Skin"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51689295470_ee944f7286_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Top-Side View of the reTyre Gravel Chaser Skin" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51689304335/in/dateposted/" title="Mud on the reTyre Gravel Chaser Skin"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51689304335_64b8364dc3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Mud on the reTyre Gravel Chaser Skin" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In conclusion I can say that the reTyre System of a base tire plus different skins is an excellent solution for those who use one bike for all their riding and don‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of changing tires before a ride or when the seasons change. Soon I will take the Gravel Chaser skins off again and put the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/07/switching-tires-never-again-thanks-to-retyre.html">Winter Traveler Skins</a> on, making my bike ready for winter. But I am already planning some rides in Pohjanmaa with the Stavanger and the Gravel Chaser skins next spring, and I am happy to know that I can switch tires in a couple of minutes and be ready!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Exploring the country by bike and camping out - bikepacking and bike-touring has been massively popular during the last year, for a good reason - it‚Äôs a much better way to go for a road-trip than by car, and you‚Äôre able to see more than by hiking. I too went exploring <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/08/impressions-from-northern-norway.html">Northern Norway</a> this <em>‚Äúsummer‚Äù</em> (it was slightly moist!) and used a combination of traditional bike-touring Panniers and bikepacking bags, which allowed me to have all my kit close at hand while on the road. This setup has been working a charm for me and continues to serve me well on my local trips - a good reason to tell you more about it though!</p>

<p>My <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/06/bikepacking-in-pirkanmaa.html">first proper bikepacking trip</a> was 9 years ago with Peter and Toni - and yes, that‚Äôs quite a while ago! Things have changed since then, too, as big brands have picked up on the topic of bikepacking, there have been innovations in bikes, bags and techniques, and more and more people have started to explore single trails with bikepacking kit since. Good stuff!</p>

<p>I knew that on my Norway trip I will be mostly cycling on roads, using the Hurtigb√•t to move from island to island to cycle and hike there. I also didn‚Äôt take my own bike with me, but loaned an electric Trekking Bike from Troms√∏ Outdoors to get around. All that made me decide to take more classic Pannier bags for the majority of my kit. To be precise, these would transport my quilt, bivy, mattress, stove, food and clothes, as well as some tech stuff. I own two small Porcelain Rocket Pannier bags, but I knew they‚Äôd be too small for the kit in question, so I had a look around and found the <a href="https://www.bikester.fi/vaude-aqua-back-light-pannier-laukku-2-kpl-948558_2484678.html">Vaude Aqua Back Light Pannier bags</a>, which tip the scales at a mere 548 g for one or 1.096 g for the pair. These were super spacious with almost 20 l of Volume per bag and I also liked that they have on the inside two pockets (one zippered), which are ideal for storing documents and small stuff. The backplate gives the whole bag some form and a stable platform to load it up, while the welded 100% recycled Econyl fabric - it is also 100% PVC-free! - is 100% waterproof. And rain I had on my trip in Norway more than enough =)</p>

<p>The attachment tech on the bag of the Pannier, called Quick Mount Release Hook QMR 2.0, is 100% adjustable to the rack on your bike - the lower hook can easily be moved 360¬∞ around the plate, and the two hooks at the top can easily be moved closer together or wider apart, and the inner diameter can also simply be adjusted to the diameter of your rack. They are just as easy to remove from the bike, which means setting up the tent and moving the gear inside is super-easy. If you want you also can use these bags as shoulder bags with the included straps, but I found the two handles more than enough to carry the bags around. The roll top closure provides quick access, the cargo net - the bungee straps - at the front provide some compression of the content, but also allow to keep your rain jacket or spare shirt close at hand (I wouldn‚Äôt do that, but should be safe to do).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51502441172/in/dateposted/" title="Vaude Aqua Back Light Pannier Bag, back"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51502441172_05d91e9419_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Vaude Aqua Back Light Pannier Bag, back" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The total volume of both bags is a claimed 38 litres with a recommended maximum load of 10 kg per bag. Overall I was a bit sceptical and not sure if these would work for my needs, but after 10 days on the road in Norway with them I‚Äôm a convert and love these Aqua Back Light Pannier bags from Vaude! Add in that they are Made in Germany with a short supply chain from 100% recycled Econyl that‚Äôs 100% PVC-free and you have a great Pannier for your bikepacking and cycle-touring adventures! In terms of aerodynamic I didn‚Äôt find that they slowed me down - I usually had an above 20 km/h average speed, which is similar to what I cycle on my bike without any bags. For relaxed bikepacking and cycle-touring trips they shouldn‚Äôt slow you down at all, which is what I expect you‚Äôre planning to do too =)</p>

<p>Up next are the three <a href="https://www.bikester.fi/revelate-designs/">Revelate Designs</a> bikepacking bags I ordered from Bikester. I have been using bikepacking bags from various well-known brands since almost a decade, and it‚Äôs something I always want on my bikes for ease of access to important kit while riding. The three Revelate Designs bags I ordered are the <a href="https://www.bikester.fi/revelate-designs-jerrycan-ylaputkilaukku-regular-364638_412644.html">Jerrycan</a>, <a href="https://www.bikester.fi/revelate-designs-mountain-feedbag-pyoralaukku-971555_2563652.html">Mountain Feedbag</a> and the amazing <a href="https://www.bikester.fi/revelate-designs-mag-tank-2000-runkolaukku-vaakaputkeen-1193575_3363727.html">Mag Tank 2000</a>. Lets start with the Jerrycan, as ideally this is the bag I access the least.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51503260091/in/dateposted/" title="Revelate Designs Jerrycan"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51503260091_f003fb80cd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Revelate Designs Jerrycan" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That‚Äôs because the Jerrycan holds on my own bikes all my repair kit: A bike tool, a spare tire + repair kit, a knife, some paper (in case the chain drops) and a Tire Lever or two. With these tools I can fix most issues I usually encounter on a trip (it are flat tires on my Tubeless rides üòÜ) and they are easily accessed but still out-of-the-way on the bike. The <a href="https://www.bikester.fi/revelate-designs-jerrycan-ylaputkilaukku-regular-364638_412644.html">Jerrycan</a> is durable, with a waterproof zipper and construction, and has about 500 ml Volume - really plenty for me. There‚Äôs a rubberized patch at the lower strap so it does not damage the paint job on your bike, and at the back strap a foam insert protects your seat post from damage. All in all a good piece of kit which does what it does, and that it does well!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51503976304/in/dateposted/" title="Revelate Designs Jerrycan with all my tools"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51503976304_28af6c7686_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Revelate Designs Jerrycan with all my tools" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>More flexible in use is the <a href="https://www.bikester.fi/revelate-designs-mountain-feedbag-pyoralaukku-971555_2563652.html">Mountain Feedbag</a>. It can hold your water bottle in the main compartment (also around 500 ml Volume) or all the snacks you want to stuff in there.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51504186630/in/dateposted/" title="Revelate Designs Mag Tank 2000 + Revelate Designs Mountain Feedbag 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51504186630_c4a88d34a7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Revelate Designs Mag Tank 2000 + Revelate Designs Mountain Feedbag 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I am Team Waterbootle in the Mountain Feedbag, but with it‚Äôs three Stretch pockets you also can put bars, gels or even a <a href="https://youtu.be/bw7cc_xXock">GoPro HERO9</a> in there. It is a 102 g light and has three attachment points, and can be attached on either side of your handlebar (so yes, you could get two!). What I really love about it is that you can open and close it with only one hand, thanks to the smart attachment system Revelate Designs has developed. This means on bumpy rides you can easily close the Mountain Feedback and not have any of the content drop out. Some people also transport their cameras or lenses in them, which doesn‚Äôt work for me (lenses &amp; cameras too big üò¨) but could be a good way for some to have their camera close by.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51503259286/in/dateposted/" title="Revelate Designs Mountain Feedbag + Waterbottle"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51503259286_2f24cf5b4a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Revelate Designs Mountain Feedbag + Waterbottle" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51503257891/in/dateposted/" title="Revelate Designs Mountain Feedbag with my bottle"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51503257891_6f36d65aed_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Revelate Designs Mountain Feedbag with my bottle" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúAnd where do all the Snacks go?‚Äù</em> you might wonder. In the <a href="https://www.bikester.fi/revelate-designs-mag-tank-2000-runkolaukku-vaakaputkeen-1193575_3363727.html">Mag Tank 2000</a> obviously! It is 149 g light and has a massive volume of around 1 litre or, all the snacks you might eat in a day or three. It also can hold a massive bike lock chain, but as you really can‚Äôt eat that I would put snacks of your liking in there. I absolutely LOVE the magnetic closure on it, it‚Äôs again such a feature which makes life while riding so much easier that you might wonder how you were able to survive without magnetic buckles on your previous trips. Also this piece has a durable construction that has kept the content dry on my trips, is easy to attach to the bike (also with the same protective features for your frame + paint job as on the Jerrycan) and it makes snacking while riding a breeze.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51503255376/in/dateposted/" title="Lots of snacks in the Revelate Designs Mag Tank 2000"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51503255376_59f0ffd14d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lots of snacks in the Revelate Designs Mag Tank 2000" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51502443502/in/dateposted/" title="Reflection"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51502443502_be1da3a4e2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Reflection" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>All in all these four (five) bag setup has held all my camping, hiking and bikepacking gear with room to spare. As I carry a Full-Frame camera + lenses + tripod + a GoPro + a Drone and spare batteries + cables I need a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/09/huckepacks-phoenix-lite-review.html">backpack</a>, but if you are happy with photos from your phone or a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/sony-rx100-iv-field-report.html">small camera</a> then you should be fine without a backpack and can ride without a sweaty back! The combination of classical cycle-touring Pannier bags + accessible bikepacking bags has worked well for me on my trips this summer, and while I own a handlebar bag and a seatpost bag for 100% bikepacking I find the Panniers easier and more comfortable to use - and on roads, be they asphalt or gravel, it is not a disadvantage at all in my experience.</p>

<p>If you currently are planning a biketouring trip and still are unsure of how to pack all the gear, I hope I could inspire you to try this or a similar setup. It has handled lots and lots of rain üåß really well, kept me well hydrated and fed, with easy access to all my gear. I also found it cool to find with <a href="https://www.bikester.fi/">Bikester</a> a Store in Europe which carries a lot of gear from <a href="https://www.bikester.fi/revelate-designs/">Revelate Designs</a> but also many other brands - like <a href="https://www.bikester.fi/vaude/">Vaude</a>! Shipping from Bikester was super-quick, with some of the kit being with me in Vaasa after just two days after ordering, for no extra costs! In the end I am very satisfied with this setup, and can‚Äôt wait to head out with the bike for a trip and camping out!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Levi is known as a Ski Mecca in Finland, with Levitunturi being an amazing mountain with 360¬∞ views over Lapland and slopes going down in every direction. That this village also is worth visiting in the summer and autumn is a little known fact outside of Finland - and even here not many people know that Levi is a great destination for active people and families in the summer!</p>

<p>Levitunturi, which means the ‚Äúfjell of Levi‚Äù in Finnish, is a 531 m high hill which stands almost on its own in the south of Lapland. Go just a few hundred meters up and already you get amazing views on the surrounding landscape: The gorgeous Pallas mountains to the North-West, the Yll√§s mountains are just some 35-ish kilometres far away to the West, as well as lakes, smaller fjells and lots &amp; lots of forests. Nestled at the Northern aspect of the mountain is the small village of Sirkka, which is the home base for almost all guests and businesses. From here you can take the Gondel up the mountain and ride on the Summer Sled Track back down, or go for a hike on one of the various trails which take you across and around the mountain.</p>

<h2 id="mountainbiking-in-and-around-levi">Mountainbiking in and around Levi</h2>

<p>Levi is known for its Bike Park, to which I will come in a moment, but also for those who look for less downhill thrill on a bike Levi has plenty to offer: A large mountain bike trail network, which allows for fun day trips on single and forest trails. I tested a section of the Levi Tunturi Trail, a 18-ish km long trail which takes you around the Levitunturi mountain, and really enjoyed how well-maintained this trail is. Some might say it‚Äôs more a highway than a trail - but then I have seen many trails which have destroyed the nature around it as more &amp; more people are riding on it; so a well-maintained trails in my experience much preferable in such a situation.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51399115323/in/album-72157719614510730/" title="MTBing in Levi"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51399115323_d4b853f929_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="MTBing in Levi" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And especially with kids who just start to ride off-road these kind of trails are an ideal choice for riding their mountain bikes safely. Even for experienced riders I think the round around Levitunturi will be fun and rewarding, especially if you take a competitive approach to it and see how fast you‚Äôre able to complete the trail! Besides this trail there many more, for example could you ride to Yll√§s and back, or even go bike packing and explore the less visited places around Levi with the bike.</p>

<p>Within Levi you most certainly don‚Äôt need a car as the village is very compact, though if you want to speed things up you can take your bike to get around town. We used our four loan bikes to ride to the Levi Bike and Activity Park, which was a short 3 km ride from where we stayed and no problem for our five-year old.</p>

<h2 id="levi-with-small-kids">Levi with small kids</h2>

<p>Speaking of our five-year-old, Levi does have plenty to offer for smaller kids which might not yet ready to ride down steep downhill trails. The <a href="https://www.levi.ski/en/summer/adventurepark">Adventure Park</a> at Gondolintie 1 for example has plenty of free options for toddlers and small kids, like a really fantastic play ground, a small Zipline parkour at ground level and the pedal-powered cars which our daughter really loved. All these are free and really fun in warm sunny weather - just make sure to bring sunscreen along as there‚Äôs almost no shade!</p>

<p>The large Zipline Parkour is for kids over 115 cm and my son and wife enjoyed this adrenaline-filled activity. There‚Äôs an introduction trail where you under supervision learn how to climb and use the different functions, and then you can pick one of several different routes - from zip lining almost 1.000 m or climbing really fun obstacles. It looked super-fun and I hope on our next visit to Levi our daughter is tall enough so her and me also can join in the fun!</p>

<p>On our last day we visited the <a href="https://www.elvesvillage.fi">Tonttula Elves Village</a> which is a bit outside of Sirkka, so we took a short taxi ride there. Here you can participate in a guided tour where you craft holiday decorations, bake gingerbread cookies - which our kids absolutely loved - and visit the large cave. There were also several farm animals around which you could pet. We also ate lunch here, and took a small hike on their forest trail. Overall the visit was very nice, even when it was July and the holiday feeling felt a tad out-of-season for us parents, though nevertheless it was fun and the kids loved it.</p>

<h2 id="levi-bike-park">Levi Bike Park</h2>

<p>After seeing my friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kaddi_kestler/">Kaddi</a> loving Downhill MTBing so much I gave in a few years ago and learned thanks to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/active-holidays-in-are-sweden.html">Jesper</a> in √Öre how to ride a MTB down steep hills. It‚Äôs absolutely thrilling and a lot of fun, and actually a lot easier and safer as it might look. So I was very excited to go Downhill riding with my son in <a href="https://www.levi.ski/en/summer/bikepark">Levi Bike Park</a>, which is one of Finland‚Äôs oldest Bike Parks.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51395761002/in/album-72157719614510730/" title="Village Trail 015"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51395761002_a2bde68f5c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Village Trail 015" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We started off with picking up our Downhill Bikes at the Levi Bike Park Shop, where we also picked up all our protective gear - from <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/poc-joint-vpd-20-knee-protektor/?pid=10239">‚àû POC Knee Protectors</a> over the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/poc-oseus-vpd-torso-protektor/?pid=10239">‚àû POC Body Harnesses</a> and Helmets to <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/poc-resistance-enduro-glove-handschuhe/?pid=10239">‚àû Gloves</a> and Shirts. After that we met our Instructor <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pietoerna/">Pieto</a> who also is a Trail Builder in Levi. Our group of six was very varied, but Pieto was able to accommodate all our different skill levels and also as a rider with some experience I learned and improved my technique during this class.</p>

<p>After some flat land techniques and getting familiar with our bikes we took the Gondola up the mountain, where we rode down the Village Trail, a Green Trail which is excellent for beginners - and thrown in some amazing Views and fun features and I think this will become a popular trail!</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/47vuHwjjPfM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>We rode the trail in sections and made several stops, where we had different ‚Äúclinics‚Äù like learning to ride Berms the correct way and how to ride waves. After we finished the Village Trail back at the Levi Activity Centre we took the Gondola back up once more and then rode the Blue Groove Trail, which is one of Levi‚Äôs most popular trails with many great Berms and exciting features - all on a easy Blue Trail level.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51396780103/in/album-72157719614510730/" title="Learning to ride Berms"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51396780103_ece28dabeb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Learning to ride Berms" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the afternoon my son and me rode with Pieto a couple more times the Village Trail and then the South Route, which we had for ourselves. Overall, while there was a constant flow of riders and bikes going up the mountain the trails were what I would consider empty - it was easy enough even on popular trails like Blue Groove to stop and shoot photos without anyone breathing down our neck. With over ten downhill trails of different levels the riders simply seem to distribute evenly across them, which is also great news for slower riders who might not enjoy the feeling of slowing others down.</p>

<p>During our two days of riding in Levi Bike Park we had many great rides with my son, and he shredded down the different trails without fear and with good technique after just one instruction session. He told me that he liked the experience and since we returned home he has been out with his <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/07/woom-off-off-review.html">woom OFF Air</a> out on the local trails, having fun.</p>

<p>On a short side-note, many Ski Centres around the globe are closed during the summers and the villages are devoid of people. This is not good for the local communities, hence I am much in favour of villages where you can life year-around. Services like the Levi Bike Park make it possible that Hotels, Restaurants and also the expensive Gondola and Lifts infrastructure do not need to be closed down and stand still once the ski season is over. Because of such and other services the small village of Sirkka is open year-around and people can make a living here from January till December.</p>

<h2 id="hiking-in-levi">Hiking in Levi</h2>

<p>Most evenings I went out for a shorter or longer hike up Levitunturi. I love the long Golden Hour you have in Lapland in the summer, and my photographer heart was full of joy about the amazing weather and views in the evenings. There are a handful of marked trails going up and around the mountain, but I usually didn‚Äôt follow any particular trail and simply explored. I liked visiting Santa‚Äôs Cabin, going to the Summit, and simply following small trails which looked interesting. If you want more guidance, then there is for example an Ice Age Trail, which tells more about the history of how these mountains came to be. Of course there‚Äôs many more trails for hiking around Levi - a look at Retkikartta will help you find and explore them!</p>

<h2 id="services-in-the-village">Services in the village</h2>

<p>Back in Sirkka with its compact centre you find many different shops and services. One service the kids and me really liked was the <a href="https://www.levi.ski/en/summer/summersledding">Summer Sled Track</a> which you can ride either alone or on a 2-Person sled. It‚Äôs a popular activity and going earlier in the morning or in the early afternoon is recommended, as after 16 o‚Äôclock it does get busy and you can wait up to an hour that you get up and down (because of the COVID-19 restrictions only people from the same family/ group are allowed into on Gondola cabin).</p>

<p>We loaned our four bikes from the <a href="https://www.levi.ski/en/summer/equipmentrental">Zero Point Store</a> down by the Slopes in Sirkka. We informed them of our heights and needs in advance online, and just had to test fit the bikes - all were the correct size - and then got our loan helmets and could start cycling. They have bikes for kids of all ages, and for example our daughter was very excited about her pink Trek Bike!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51397253614/in/album-72157719614510730/" title="Levi Centre after 22:00"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51397253614_d98886a12b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Levi Centre after 22:00" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the Tourist Information you can book activities, accommodation and get tickets for the lifts, and in the same street you find sport shops in case you forgot something important at home. There‚Äôs a couple of Caf√©s for an afternoon snack and coffee as well as several Restaurants if you have more hunger. As we had a kitchen in our apartment we bought food at the S-Market Supermarket in the centre and prepared meals at home.</p>

<p>As I don‚Äôt drink alcohol anymore I didn‚Äôt have any need to visit some of the bars and nightclubs which are in Levi, though if you fancy a cold pint of beer after a thrilling day on the downhill trails then there‚Äôs the possibility to do so!</p>

<h2 id="where-to-stay">Where to stay</h2>

<p>We stayed in a spacious apartment at <a href="https://www.hulluporo.fi/en/">Hullu Poro Hotel</a>. It‚Äôs a five minute walk from the centre, the bus stops right in front of it when you arrive and leave, and it has a small Spa with a Sauna and Hot tub which the kids enjoyed going to every evening. Our apartment could accommodate up to six persons - there were three bedrooms, two showers and WCs, with a small kitchen and a nice eating and living room area. We also had an own Sauna, but as it was quite warm we didn‚Äôt use it. It was a comfortable base for us four, and the included breakfast was very good.</p>

<p>There are several more accommodation options available, so best is to check out the <a href="https://www.levi.fi/en/accommodation.html?__hstc=222398596.5f194482a517902a3e519b566ac3564c.1629786273581.1629786273581.1629786273581.1&amp;__hssc=222398596.4.1629786273581&amp;__hsfp=1451467367">Accommodations</a> website from Levi.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-here">How to get here</h2>

<p>We travelled by train and bus to Levi, via <a href="">Rovaniemi</a> where we slept a night in the Hostel Caf√© Koti. This allowed us to have shorter travel days and explore a bit of Rovaniemi, for example the fantastic (free!) Angry Birds playground. We spent several hours here, with the kids playing on the many [check what lapses calls the ‚Äúinstallations‚Äù/ telin√§t]. There‚Äôs also a Futbol court and you can loan balls, so the kids and me also kicked some balls there.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/15v5xX" title="Angry Birds Park in Rovaniemi"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51399203368_0641ace52c_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Angry Birds Park in Rovaniemi" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But yeah, Bus and Train. We took the Train from Vaasa to Rovaniemi and back, which was affordable if you book early - we spent 75,00 ‚Ç¨ going-return for our train tickets. The trip takes between 6 and 8 hours with two transfers for us, but with some card games, audiobooks and some additional screen time it‚Äôs easy to make the journey pleasant for all. The Bus from Rovaniemi to Levi and back was more expensive than the train for a single journey, but only took around 3 hours.</p>

<p>You can fly to Kittil√§ with Finnair, which is the fastest possibility. Flights are still limited and apparently also bit more expensive, so if you want to travel by plane to Levi make sure to book in advance. There‚Äôs local busses from Kittil√§ to Levi and back which run in sync with the flights, so getting to Levi and to the airport is easy.</p>

<h2 id="the-gear">The Gear</h2>

<p>We travelled light as usual, with only the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/06/ultralight-family-travel-with-eagle-creek.html">Arc‚Äôteryx V110 Duffel</a> and our Eagle Creek Cubes for our four clothes and stuff. I carried my camera gear and MacBook in my trusted <a href="https://bit.ly/2WjccTK">‚àû Peak Design Travel Backpack</a>, and also had my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/09/huckepacks-phoenix-lite-review.html">HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite</a> for hiking and the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/vaude-trail-spacer-18-wanderrucksack/?pid=10239">‚àû Vaude TrailSpacer 18</a> for all cycling activities along. My favourite piece of kit which I had along was probably my <a href="https://lunasandals.com/?rfsn=35669.8168e">‚àû Luna Sandals OSO Flaco</a> and my <a href="https://tidd.ly/3yfTXLM">‚àû Houdini Daybreak Shorts</a>, I wear these in the summer ALL THE TIME. As previously mentioned, we loaned the Mountain Bikes and Downhill Bikes + Protective Gear in Levi from the Levi Bike Park Shop (for Downhill Gear) and the MTBs in Sirkka from Zero Point, as it‚Äôs easier to travel without bikes by public transportation =)</p>

<h2 id="should-you-go">Should you go?</h2>

<p>Travelling during the on-going COVID-19 Pandemic seems strange, but the reality is that many families need a break. Levi offered a safe travel experience and proper Hygiene &amp; Safety were observed almost everywhere, from the Bike Park Shop to the Gondola Cabins to Caf√©s, Hotels and Supermarkets. We very much enjoyed our stay in Levi, with interesting and fun activities for kids and adults alike. We especially liked that there were heaps of free activities available around the Adventure Park, and as our kids enjoy cycling it was great to simply explore the surroundings by bike. So if you and your family are looking for an active holiday destination where you also can relax, take a closer look at Levi. With its many different activities, plenty of accommodation options for any wallet and the great views from Levitunturi, it‚Äôs certainly a destination which you should keep in mind for your next summer or autumn holiday!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Summer, sunshine, cycling and hiking - as well as many cloudy days and some rain üòÜ were what I experienced on my Arctic Island Hopping Trip in Northern Norway these past ten days. Here‚Äôs some first photographic impressions from a very memorable trip.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.visit-lyngenfjord.com/themed-trips/arctic-island-hopping-in-the-lyngenfjordregion">Arctic Island Hopping</a> is a fantastic way to explore the Lyngen Alps area, with its dozens of smaller and larger islands. In Troms√∏ you get on the Hurtigb√•t and then simply hop on or hop off where you want to go explore. As I am a big fan of the Lyngen Alps it was a great possibility to explore them in the summer ‚òÄÔ∏è with the bike and on foot.</p>

<p>Besides many ‚ÄúMust-See‚Äù locations like Bl√•isvannet and Lyngstuva above I also visited some hidden gems. Generally my days consisted of biking to a hiking location, hiking for a few hours, and then biking back to my cabin or tent for the night. As on these islands is very little traffic the cycling is super relaxed and enjoyable, and also on my hikes I did not meet many people.</p>

<p>I usually am very spoiled with good weather when on trips, though that wasn‚Äôt the case this time around. It was un-usually cold and cloudy, and even if on these photos you see mostly sun and blue sky, I did have a lot more grey days. But even on these the sun did come through at some point, even if it was just at 22:00 o‚Äôclock in the evening to say Good Night to me. You can see lots of Insta Stories from the trip on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikmorkel/">Instagram profile</a> if you want to see already now what I all did and experienced, or just sit back and wait till the Article and Youtube Videos drop later this August!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After many years of riding very happily on his <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/woom-bikes/">woom Bikes</a> it was once again to size up to the next one - but this time we decided to for the woom OFF AIR as it will allow us to go explore the local Mountain Bike trails! It of course also works great for riding to school and to the beach, as we have seen during the past three months, but it really shines on trails!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51327790178/in/dateposted/" title="woom OFF AIR 6 in its natural habitat"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51327790178_7dcd01ab76_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="woom OFF AIR 6 in its natural habitat" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

As you know: I‚Äôm keepin‚Äô it real and tell you how it is - I maintain full editorial control of the content published on Hiking in Finland.

<p>The <a href="https://woom.com/de_DE/fahrraeder/off-air-6">woom AIR OFF 6</a> is my son‚Äôs third woom Bike in four years - we started with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/03/urban-family-transportation.html">woom 4</a> in 2018, a great bike which our smallest is starting to ride now. In 2019 we got the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/07/woom-bikes-because-also-kids-deserve-great-bikes.html">woom 5</a> which he rode very happily in all seasons for nearly two years, before now in 2021 getting the woom OFF AIR 6. The numbers in Sizing of the woom Bikes is brilliant, it makes it very easy to know which bike to get next - and the Bikes themselves also grow nicely with the kids, and often can be used over a year or two as you can adjust the seat and handlebar. That just as a side note - now onwards to the woom OFF AIR 6.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51326855692/in/dateposted/" title="Downhill with the woom OFF AIR 6"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51326855692_e19283d706_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Downhill with the woom OFF AIR 6" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The first question probably is: Why the woom OFF AIR 6 and not a regular <a href="https://woom.com/de_DE/fahrraeder/woom-6">woom 6</a> or the <a href="https://woom.com/en_INT/bikes/off-6">woom OFF</a>? The answer is easy: The woom OFF AIR 6 gives us more possibilities. The possibility to go ride MTB Trails and some easier Downhill Trails - things the regular woom 6 also can do, but which are more comfortable, fun and safe with the woom OFF AIR. If you want your kids to go outdoors instead of sitting inside and playing video games all day, then good equipment is key in our experience. And getting the kids to want to go outside means they spend all that energy on something useful - in this case riding their bikes in nature - instead of fighting, nagging and other unproductive stuff. So, good gear gets the kids outside where they exhaust their power, and everyone in the family benefits üòä</p>

<p>The Specs of the OFF AIR are made for trail riding, with hydraulic disc brakes, an hydraulic air suspension fork with 80 mm travel, SRAM X5 gears and Schwalbe Rocket Ron tires for maximum grip on the trails. My son finds the woom saddles very comfortable and also long or rocky rides are no problem. Equally the handlebar grips are comfortable, with the brake and shifting levers in easy reach of smaller children hands. The bike also comes with flat pedals which is nice, so you don‚Äôt need to go hunt for some pedals when the bike arrives. Finally, the geometry of the bike is good for pedalling and not too aggressive, which means the bike also can be used for riding to school and the beach. You can check out the full specs on the woom website and be delighted about the high-quality components woom used on this kid‚Äôs bike - they are great!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51327589981/in/dateposted/" title="Brakes on the woom OFF AIR 6"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51327589981_0a2edcdf0f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Brakes on the woom OFF AIR 6" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51328581330/in/dateposted/" title="SRAM X5 Gears on the woom OFF AIR 6"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51328581330_4bb6796112_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="SRAM X5 Gears on the woom OFF AIR 6" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This being a woom bike obviously also means it is light, something which is SO IMPORTANT for a kids bike that I can not stress it enough. The woom OFF AIR 6 weighs just 11 kg as it is made from high-quality 6061 T6 aluminum (with butted and hydroformed tubes), which makes this a nimble bike on the trails and despite ‚Äúonly‚Äù nine gears my son was racing up the hills and it was a joy to watch - if you ever had your child complain about not wanting to ride an uphill, you know what I mean! On the downhill and the singletrack trails the bike reacts fast and gets through tight corners with ease - even if these corners are full of roots and rocks. And even without much training it was easy for my son to lift the fork over obstacles like trees on the trail, which is another benefit of the light build and the good geometry.</p>

<p>Something I liked was that the bike has high-quality 6 x 2.35‚Ä≥ Schwalbe Rocket Ron tires with the addition of the ADDIX SPEED rubber compound, which makes the tires more durable. It‚Äôs great to see woom giving their bikes high-quality tires instead of cutting corners and saving some ‚Ç¨¬£$ and go with cheaper non-branded ones. These Schwalbe tires have a low rolling resistance and great grip on trails and gravel roads alike. The tires are high-volume which means they helps absorb some vibration and provide a plusher ride compared to skinnier tires. I didn‚Äôt really care for the Car-type valves for easy filling at any gas station, but happily our tire pump has an adapter for these so it‚Äôs just a small issue =) You probably have noticed on the photos that the woom OFF AIR has thru-axles on both the front and rear wheel. These provide superior stability in comparison to the quick-release skewers you‚Äôll find on most kids bikes, and shows once more the bike‚Äôs trail credentials.</p>

<p>Now the Suspension fork is made my RST, it is an AIR fork as the name suggests which means you‚Äôre easily able to adjust the pressure to the weight of your child. The Suspension fork works great (and also gets a lot of use, even on normal non-trail rides üòä), with the stanchions sliding effortlessly through the lowers with a super smooth feel, without any noticeable friction. The rebound is smooth, even with the lower pressure we put on it as our son is lightweight. The 80 mm of the AIR fork provide plenty of travel for most types of riding, and it has a lockout switch which is useful on longer climbs. Once I explained what it‚Äôs for and how to use it, it was also easy to operate by my son himself. If you feel your child doesn‚Äôt need a suspension fork - there‚Äôs the <a href="https://woom.com/en_INT/bikes/off-6">woom OFF</a> which comes with a rigid, light carbon fork and which is only 9,3 kg heavy in Size 6. It‚Äôs also cheaper than the AIR version, but otherwise nearly identical to the OFF AIR 6 in this review.</p>

<p>The handlebars on the woom OFF AIR 6 are 680 mm wide, which is a good size for our son. Sure, you could have a wider handlebar but he feels this is fine at the moment and does not need to be changed. In the beginning my son had some problems with the SRAM trigger shifter on the OFF AIR, as he was used to the grip-shifter found on his old woom bikes. After I explained how to use them (something you always should do, it‚Äôs too easy to think ‚Äú<em>They will know!</em>‚Äù as an adult!) he is now easily shifting gears - though still sometimes forget on an uphill climb that he can shift in a lower gear üòÜ</p>

<p>We have not rode on very technical trails (as in, very rocky and full of roots) yet, but on the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù trails here in Vaasa with a normal amount of roots and rocks the fork has absorb everything well. But it‚Äôs still a hard tail, so make sure your kid knows to have a good riding posture so it doesn‚Äôt get thrown around. I imagine my son should be fine to ride green and blue Trails in most Bike Parks with his woom OFF AIR 6, which means if you as a parent enjoy going to the Bike Park then with this Bike you can take your child along and don‚Äôt need to rent a bike!</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>In the end the <a href="https://woom.com/de_DE/fahrraeder/off-air-6">woom OFF AIR 6</a> is a great addition to our bike shed, and allows us to spend more time together in nature on our local trails. If your child is completely new to riding singletrack trails and easy downhill runs at the Bike Park, then this bike is a solid choice - also because with its light weight and child-friendly geometry it works well as a everyday bike for riding around town. But it‚Äôs obviously made for riding mountain bike trails, and that it does superbly - even with a beginner rider in the saddle. The suspension fork works great for our lightweight child, the hydraulic brakes make stopping a breeze, the SRAM X5 gears make climbing uphills fun and the Schwalbe Rocket Ron tires give the rider good grip and confidence on even the most loose surfaces. Overall we are very happy with the OFF AIR 6, and while we wish the bike would come with a quick-release seatpost collar to easier change the height of the seat, and internal cable routing, for more protection of the cables on trails, our son and us parents are very happy with this bike. I see us riding many trails in Finland and hopefully also Norway and Sweden in the future with this superb kid‚Äôs bike!</p>

<p>The last time I was in <a href="https://www.levi.fi/en/home-2.html">Levi</a> was in Winter - and I had a great time skiing its slopes and enjoying the views. Now it was summer in Levi, which, thanks to the hightening Climate Emergency, means we had several days where the Thermometer almost showed 30¬∞C - so longsleeves and sunscreen were mandatory. Nevertheless, all four of us had a good time - on foot, on bikes and in the summer sleds! Here are our first impressions from the trip, the rest will follow in a couple of weeks =)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I truly dislike switching tires on our bikes. Switching the tires on four bikes every autumn and spring is for me one of the most tedious jobs I have to do, and I try to pro-long this task until it‚Äôs no longer possible. All that changed with reTyre, though: Now switching tires is as easy as zipping up the fly of a tent!</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Strangely, installing the <a href="https://rty.re/3yCIarN">reTyre One</a> made me happy. I wasn‚Äôt 100% sure if it would fit on my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/pelago-bicycles-stavanger.html">Pelago Stavanger</a> bike as the reTyre One needs some ‚Äúlarge‚Äù clearance but in the end I had plenty of space with room to spare. But from the start. Knowing that this might be the last time ever for me to switch tires on this bike, I was looking forward to installing the reTyre One. Installation was easy - I have many years practice in this after all, doing it for the three to four bikes of our family twice a year. Old tire off, reTyre One on, test-fitting to check clearance: Perfect, with plenty of room to spare for the Skins. The same procedure with the back wheel and then installing the <a href="https://rty.re/3yCIarN">Winter Traveler</a> Skin as we still had ice and snow on the roads back in March when I installed the reTyre One.</p>

<p>I also want to briefly write about the installation of the Skins, which are zipped on to the reTyre One. The skins and the reTyre One have zippers which allows you to connect the Skin - and there‚Äôs four different Skins available for different cycling needs - to the reTyre One. The reTyre One itself is a fully functional bicycle tire - indeed I have been using it the past two months - but with the different Skins you‚Äôre able to put on a new ‚ÄúTire‚Äù onto your bike without the hassle of actually switching the tire. Zipping on a Skin takes me about two Minutes and it‚Äôs even quicker taking it off. It‚Äôs a great way to adapt the bike to different terrains and seasons - zip on the Winter Traveler Skin as soon as the snow starts falling, and take them off in spring. Then just as easy I can zip on the <a href="https://rty.re/3hhzjpx">Gravel Chaser</a> Skin when I head bikepacking and offroad.</p>

<h2 id="riding-the-winter-traveler">Riding the Winter Traveler</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://rty.re/3yCIarN">Winter Traveler</a> Skin was my first experience of riding with the reTyre Skin System. We had a good winter this year in Vaasa and had snow till late March, with some more snow in April and even May. Especially the snow in April was a good way to see the benefit of these zip-on tyres: I already was riding with just the reTyre One but when the snow and subsequent ice came, it was easy to zip on the studded Winter Traveler tire in a few minutes and the I could continue to safely cycle in these <em>Takaa Talvi</em> conditions. reTyre has two different Winter Skins, besides the Winter Traveler which I am riding there‚Äôs also the Ice Racer which has more studs. The Winter Traveler however has been perfectly adequate for the icey roads I rode on, and I had no feeling of insecurity while riding with these tires in slippery conditions. I reserve long-term judgement for a later point in the future, but in the few weeks I rode them on snow and ice I was satisfied and can recommend them.</p>

<p>One of the best things about the Winter Traveler skins where however the ease of use to get rid of the ‚ÄúWinter Tires‚Äù once all the snow was gone. In a few seconds the Skins were off and I could ride on the reTyre One on the ice-free asphalt roads. What previously was accompanied by a few swear words when changing the complete tire was now done with a smile on my face =) I do not know how the zipper system will live up to prolonged use, dirt and the elements but thus far it has been a fantastic experience and worked flawless.</p>

<h2 id="riding-the-retyre-one">Riding the reTyre One</h2>

<p>So the <a href="https://rty.re/3yCIarN">reTyre One</a> is not only the base tire to which you can zip-on skins, but it also is a fully functional bicycle tire on its own. I‚Äôll test and use the <a href="https://rty.re/3hhzjpx">Gravel Chaser</a> Skin soon on a few bikepacking trips, but at the moment, when all my cycling is to the beach, supermarket, to different hobbies and around town the reTyre One feels like the perfect tire for my needs in town. It has good grip both on dry and wet surfaces (though with the current heatwave going on, we have had really little rain so no idea how it is on very wet surfaces). Besides the grip the rolling resistance is good =&gt; which means it is low and fast-rolling. I rode over the past 7 years a mix of different tires from different brands on my bikes, from smooth slicks for fast road cycling to hardcore gravel and downhill tires which were slower on Asphalt but had great, secure grip on offroad surfaces. I usually prefer something in the middle, with a tendency towards more offroad capabilities, but I really like how fast I can go with the reTyre One (you see, I go towards 40 and a fast bike is for me more attractive than a fast car!). Maybe also because I know how quickly I could zip on a more offroad worthy Skin to get that additional grip on gravel roads.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51291329671/in/dateposted/" title="reTyre One 3"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51291329671_7f4e12c2b0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="reTyre One 3" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51292045799/in/dateposted/" title="Summer Vibes with the reTyre One"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51292045799_fb127a5b6d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Summer Vibes with the reTyre One" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The reTyre One is also very competitevely priced at 29,00 ‚Ç¨ - similar tires from other brands easily cost just as much or more (as you often pay for the brand name) while with the reTyre One you also get the additional benefit of its multifunctionality. For example, you could now get a pair of <a href="https://rty.re/3yCIarN">reTyre One</a> tires and use them for all you cycling this summer and autumn, and then get a pair of <a href="https://rty.re/3yCIarN">Winter Traveler</a> Skins in November, zip then on and continue using your bike without the massive hassle of switching tires the traditional way.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51291329976/in/dateposted/" title="reTyre One isn&#x27;t afraid of gravel"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51291329976_ec835b74b9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="reTyre One isn&#x27;t afraid of gravel" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>Overall I am really happy with the reTyre One tire and the Winter Traveler Skin - the ease of use of zipping of the studded winter tire was amazing, and the reTyre One is a great tire for my everyday kind of cycling. Also, those blue details on the reTyre One look amazing - so üëç for the great design! The Set of Winter Traveler and reTyre One are also similar in price, if not cheaper, than two pairs of tires - plus they use a lot less space than normal tires in storage!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51292045724/in/dateposted/" title="Thumbs up for reTyre"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51292045724_5b5e6f70a5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Thumbs up for reTyre" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>However, there‚Äôs maybe one thing that I hope reTyre will come out with in the future, and that‚Äôs a Tubeless Version of their reTyre One tire. I much prefer riding tubeless and while I always had tires with an inner tube on my Pelago Stavanger bike, I prefer the peace of mind of a Tubeless setup. Sure, the reTyre One has a puncture protection and with a Skin on there would need to be some serious sharp/ spikey thing üåµ coming my way to give me a flat tire - though then I seem to have some knack for finding just these üòÜ After three months of riding nothing like that has occurred yet, and I remain hopeful that it won‚Äôt.</p>

<p>Truth be told, because of my new job I worked out less than in the winter and spring. After a long work day I rather wanted to dive into my man cave and paint than sweat and be bothered by the Mosquitos when running. But when addnature approached me and asked if I‚Äôd be interested in a cooperation, it was a great opportunity to get back into the healthy habit of running regularly after a work day!</p>

<h2 id="ordering-from-addnature">Ordering from addnature</h2>

<p>I knew <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/">addnature</a> before, and they carry many of the brands which I value and like - La Sportiva, Houdini, Rab, Patagonia, Black Diamond, Salomon and inov-8 - so it was very easy to find gear which I liked. Ordering is easy - There‚Äôs all the usual Payment Options via Klarna and shipping was via PostNord, which was even faster than DHL: The parcel arrived in five days in Vaasa. My environmentally friendly packed addnature order arrived in a durable plastic bag, which I like a lot as these are easy to recycle and take much less space to store than a package. Anyway, everything I ordered - more on that in a moment - fitted me well so it was time to put the new kit on after a day in the office and go for a run!</p>

<h2 id="that-running-motivation">That running motivation</h2>

<p>In April I wrote about my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/04/short-runs-to-happiness.html">short runs</a> and back then I was still running in my winter running gear on old snow, ice and mud - but by the time my new running kit arrived it was full-blown spring here, and so now blooming flowers, lots of bilberries, lingonberries and green birches line the trails I run on. Oh, and then there‚Äôs Mosquitos. 2021 is a really bad Mosquito year and they are out in force here in Finland, and even if I am running they seem to be able to catch up with me and feast on my delicious blood. Maybe I need to run faster?! Anyway, running in this wonderful green nature is for me a great motivator to go out. Even if I run only 4 km being out in the green is a very positive experience for me, and helps me to recharge my mental batteries. I feel better, more relaxed and it‚Äôs good to maintain the healthy habit of being outdoors every day.</p>

<h2 id="the-fresh-new-running-gear">The fresh, new running gear</h2>

<p>I know, I know - you wanna know what I got and how I like it! So here it is üòä First I got some new running socks from Injinji - the <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/injinji-ultra-run-no-show-juoksusukat-miehet-1319725_3817369.html">Ultra Run No-Show Socks</a> and the <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/injinji-sport-original-weight-mini-crew-coolmax-socks-1234824_3508161.html">Sport Original Weight Mini-Crew CoolMax Socks</a> as I really like Injinji socks and find them super-comfortable. I really like running in the Ultra Run No-Show Socks and think I‚Äôll need to pick up another pair or two in the future for every day use and hiking. I love that it almost feels like I don‚Äôt wear socks with these Injinji socks, and that I also can wear them with my Luna Sandals. If you‚Äôre not fond of socks, you might actually find these good, so they are worth trying in my opinion. I really love them.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51279482825/in/dateposted/" title="Socks &amp; Shoes"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51279482825_e6b832bc3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Socks &amp; Shoes" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After my only <em>OK experiences</em> with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/03/all-the-shoes.html">inov-8 Mudclaw G 260</a> I decided to try the <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/inov-8-roclite-275-shoes-men-1113347_3054977.html">inov-8 RocLite G 275 Shoes</a> as I have hiked and run in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/first-look-inov-8-roclite-295.html">Roclite 295s</a> waaaaay back in time and wanted to see how I like these new version with the Graphene Sole. So far the shoes have been great - comfortable, breathable and with great grip on different surfaces. It‚Äôs to early to say anything about durability yet but at the moment it looks like these are a keeper and more durable than the Mudclaws. I think also for hiking these will be great, the lugs are not as deep as on the Mudclaws so I expect them to be both more durable and long-lasting while still giving me good traction on difficult terrain.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51278629323/in/dateposted/" title="Sticky Soles"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51278629323_75b5855032_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sticky Soles" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51277710592/in/dateposted/" title="Rocks and Needles"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51277710592_b3c918daee_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Rocks and Needles" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As you already saw in the photos - I picked a more relaxed outfit for running. I have usually ran in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">compression garments from Salomon</a> - which I still use - but it felt a bit <em>too much</em> for my current running routine. So I picked something which is a bit more toned down but still fun. I ended up ordering the <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/adidas-terrex-primeblue-trail-graphic-shorts-men-1378017_4027719.html">adidas terrex Primeblue Trail Graphic Shorts</a> and an <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/inov-8-organic-cotton-tee-obsessed-men-1317265_3804982.html">inov-8 Organic Cotton Tee</a>. The shorts are great - they are made from Parley Ocean Plastic - and not only because of their purple colour and material I really like them. They are comfortable, breathable and have two small zippered pockets in which I can store the phone, keys and some snacks. They are for me ideal running/ sports shorts as they have a relaxed cut and fit me perfectly, and they look less like I‚Äôm an Ultra-Runner and more like someone who enjoys running to stay fit.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51277711427/in/dateposted/" title="Vorne"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51277711427_3629f3fb7a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Vorne" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The shirt I am not that fond of - it‚Äôs simply too thick for my taste. I like the cool print on the back (if you follow me for a while you know that I like smart prints on my T-Shirts!) but I run too hot in this - it‚Äôs made from 100% Organic Cotton, which I like, but I prefer it in a thinner strength. As I often wear Patagonia Capilene Cool Shirts I might try one of these or a <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/patagonia-cap-cool-lightweight-lyhythihainen-paita-miehet-M666971.html?vgid=G1110392&amp;cgid=233239">Cap Cool Lightweight Shirt</a> instead. This inov-8 shirt is cool, but for me not a good choice for running.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51277710802/in/photostream/" title="Backside"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51277710802_27b3a35be5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Backside" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Which leaves the two <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/inov-8-running-wrag-1214121_3431361.html">inov-8 Running Wrags</a> I got. These basically are Buffs and I use them when running to keep my throat a bit better protected from the wind, if it‚Äôs really sunny as a headband and also to wipe the sweat away. I was surprised that there were two in the package but that means I always have one clean one waiting for my next run!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51278631213/in/dateposted/" title="Into the forest"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51278631213_35b4879b0a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Into the forest" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And that‚Äôs the new gear I got for trailrunning. I was tempted to also pick up a <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/inov-8-race-ultra-pro-5-juomareppu-M114960.html">Race Ultra Pro 5 Vest</a> but then it‚Äôs not really needed for my short runs at the moment üòÅ Overall I‚Äôm very satisfied with the kit (and also the fast delivery from addnature) and it has performed well on my short runs over the past weeks. It‚Äôs nice to go out running, and feeling better after it! If you still need a good reason to go (back) to running more regularly, maybe also treat yourself to some new <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/koe-vapaus-poluilla/?pmid=trail-running-freedom&amp;srule=newest-first&amp;page=1&amp;sz=48">running gear</a> and go outdoors! If you need some additional Motivation: With each run you build up more stamina and walking skills for hiking, so maybe simply few trailrunning as training for backpacking!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We still don‚Äôt own a car, we still don‚Äôt want to own a car, and there‚Äôs still no alternatives to owning a car available in Vaasa (or any other small town in Finland/ Scandinavia) in 2021. It‚Äôs frustrating if you want to go to a hiking trail a bit further away with the family or if you have to pick up stuff you can not transport with a bike. And it makes me wonder: Will we still have to own a car in 2030 or will there soon come Mobility As A Service options also to smaller cities and towns?</p>

<p>In March 2019 I blogged that not owning a car isn‚Äôt a problem for us, as <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/03/urban-family-transportation.html">we can do everything with the bike</a>. This still holds true 95% of the time today, but then there‚Äôs those 5%. Much of these 5% involve kid‚Äôs hobbies, especially during winter (so the time between November and April here in Vaasa), where it‚Äôs not easy to motivate kids (and adults) to ride at -15¬∞C on badly ploughed roads to a swimming lesson in the evening - and back home. You might think: <em>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt complain, just cycle there!‚Äù</em> and it‚Äôs definitely the attitude I also have - but forcing a child to go cycle in such weather is a sure way to make them hate the hobby as they don‚Äôt want to bother with the cycling there and back in such weather. So this past winter we cheated a bit, as we had a car loaned to us (I‚Äôm calling it ‚ÄúThe Coffin‚Äù as it‚Äôs 30+ years old and has a lot of problems).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/872x51" title="Herbie"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51216467167_9417f69dee_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Herbie" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="hours">168 hours</h2>

<p>One Day has 24 hours and thus a week has 168 hours. We moved with the car around 3 hours a week, which means it sat 165 hours in the driveway - or 98,21% of the time. Is it worth it to own a car so that it can sit 98% of the time in your driveway? I think not. Sure, we are again an exception to this situation, as our neighbours have one, two, three, four or more cars sitting in their driveways and seem to move around with them a bit more than us (because we still cycle almost everywhere), but even they probably don‚Äôt move their cars for more than 20 hours a week - which would be 12% of the weekly hours and means a car is sitting idly on a parking spot for 78% of the week.</p>

<p>Do you see where I go with this? The majority of <strong>cars only stand around</strong>. Yes, it‚Äôs nice to jump in a heated car in winter and drive the 10 minutes to the swim lesson if there‚Äôs a snow storm raging outside. If you want to support a local restaurant it‚Äôs nice to go pick-up tasty Take-Away Food. Have to transport four bags of cement? That‚Äôs one easy ride with the car. But it still means the car stands around, in our case, 98% of the time. Which for me means it‚Äôs a waste of space (I don‚Äôt like that it blocks the bigger part of the driveway) and also resources, as even this loaned car has costs - gasoline for use, insurance, Parking fees in the city and electricity costs for pre-heating it in winter.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/AJDft6" title="Yellow"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51216467097_67c70c4755_b.jpg" width="766" height="1024" alt="Yellow" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="a-new-car">A New Car</h2>

<p>So over the past months we have had many discussions about if we should buy a car once <em>‚ÄúThe Coffin‚Äù</em> leaves us in a few weeks. There are happily many good Electric Car Alternatives available today, which at least make the driving part more environmentally friendly - I want to avoid buying a gasoline powered car for many reasons. Thus we looked at many small EVs or electric car alternatives - from the Arcimoto FUV over the Citro√´n Ami and Next e.Go to the BMW i3 and ‚Äúbigger‚Äù cars like a Skoda Enyaq, Volkswagen ID.3/ ID.4 and even a Tesla. But we always came back to the same conclusion: We don‚Äôt want to buy a car. We don‚Äôt want to own a car. But for these two to three hours a week where a car is useful, it would be AMAZING to have easy access to a car without needing to travel (by bike or Taxi) to a pick-up point to get a loan car for an hour or less.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/n2706N" title="Tesla Model 3"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51217390878_a95a2d6368_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tesla Model 3" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="mobility-as-a-service">Mobility As A Service</h2>

<p>As we don‚Äôt want to own a car, we looked at Mobility as a Service Options. It would be great to have a MaaS Provider like <a href="https://www.greenmobility.com/fi/en/greenmobilitys-cities/">GreenMobility</a> in Vaasa, alas they are at the moment only in Helsinki (and Copenhagen, Gothenborg, Ghent and more). It‚Äôs a modern System that works with an App and the thing I like the most is that it are all Electric Vehicles and that it‚Äôs a Pay as you need System - so if you only need a car for driving 10 Minutes to the Swimming Hall, you pay for 10 minutes - all within the App. And something which is very convenient too is that Insurance is also included, and it should be very easy to find a Parking Spot thanks to the App and the VIP Parking Spots of GreenMobility in the cities they are. The single best thing is that you can unlock the car with the App, so if you see the car in on the street you simply can walk there, unlock it, and drive away. It‚Äôs super easy and really how I envision MaaS to work üöôüòä And no, sadly this article isn‚Äôt sponsored by them!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51216485507/in/photostream/" title="GreenMobility App"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51216485507_de58f011c0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="GreenMobility App" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a href="https://whimapp.com/helsinki/en/">Whim</a> is another MaaS Provider in Helsinki (and Turku, Vienna, and more) which is including even more options: You can easily buy a (seasonal) ticket for Public Transportation, rent a car, drive a Citybike, E-Scooter or a Taxi. It also works with an App and makes it very convenient to e.g. ride a Citybike to a Metro Stop, ride the Metro to your destination and then there walk (or use a E-Scooter) to your final destination. This has a lot more mobility options which makes it a great All-In-One Place to book transportation of any means.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here‚Äôs an <a href="http://www.shapehelsinki.com/project/whimapp">interesting case study</a> on the creation of the Whim App.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Helsinki you also have the <a href="https://citycarclub.fi/en">City Car Club</a>, a real innovator in the Car Sharing area as they exist since 1999. If you join you can use their cars to do your driving, from one hour to several days. There are many benefits to car sharing, like one car sharing car replaces between 8 - 10 private cars and there are less cars standing around (remember that in my example above our car would be standing around 165 hours a week!). Sharing a car with multiple neighbours or people from our neighbourhood could work great, as long as not everyone needs the car at the same time. There‚Äôs things like working out the insurance stuff and such, but generally car sharing would be a great way for us to have access to a car, but not owning a car. Sadly, such an option is currently not available in Vaasa, so we might need to bring up this idea with the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>A MaaS Provider which is available in Vaasa is 24Rent. Sadly they only have Vans available for renting, otherwise this would be a good opportunity to rent a car for short amounts of time. But if I need to transport large amounts of stuff, this will come in useful in the future!</p>

<p><em>Update 02.06.2021</em>: Matti from 24Rent reached out to me to inform me that they soon also will offer passenger cars in Vaasa for rent. And even better, they also have a service called <a href="https://24go.fi">24Go</a> which is already available in the Capital Region, Tampere, Lahti and Oulu and they also are planning on launching it to Vaasa at some point - which would another perfect solution for us as it works easy with an App and would allow us to loan a car for simply 15 minutes when needed!</p>

<h2 id="so-what-now">So what now?</h2>

<p>Yeah, that is a good question. If you don‚Äôt want to have a car standing around in your driveway for 98% of the time you are sadly in a minority, as most people seem to be happy to have one or more cars standing in front of their house. There‚Äôs no good MaaS Provider available in Vaasa (yet!) so currently the only option is to either start a Car Sharing Initiative in the neighbourhood/ city or get an own car. Happily right now it is summer, our daughter &amp; son are very enthusiastic about cycling, so for the next three months we won‚Äôt need to think too much about a car. But once November rolls around with lots of rain, darkness and then winter with snow and cold temperatures, the discussion of how to get to the Hobbies will come up again, and till then we‚Äôd like to have a viable solution on the table. Of course being able to drive to hiking trails which are a bit further away during the summer is nice, too! If you have an idea, feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/">Facebook</a>! And if you are living in Vaasa and want to start a car sharing initiative - get in touch, too üòé</p>

<p>If you travel to and from Lapland, plan in an overnight stay in Rovaniemi for less hurry and more relaxation. Hostel Caf√© Koti is the place to sleep if you want comfortable beds and rooms with a Nordic Design, and as it‚Äôs in the centre of Rovaniemi you can walk everywhere in a few minutes! A stroll along the shore of the river is a must in Rovaniemi, with scenic views on the city. Visit the Arktikum Museum if you want knowledge and culture, or take a hike up Ounasvaara on the (Winter) Trail. If you need even more action - rent a Fatbike from RollOutdoors!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51169568736/in/photostream/" title="Rollo Dusk"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51169568736_561f4ce570_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Rollo Dusk" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="travelling-north-and-south">Travelling North and South</h2>

<p>When my son and me travelled back from our <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/03/fatbiking-in-saariselka.html">winter holiday in Saariselk√§</a> we decided to spend on the way back home an afternoon and night in Rovaniemi - simply as travelling south with public transportation is quite long and difficult to organize in a smooth way (VR and Matkahuolto haven‚Äôt realized yet that they could synchronize their schedules).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51170937352/in/dateposted/" title="Rovaniemi Railway Station"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51170937352_c9225fd3aa_h.jpg" width="1200" height="1600" alt="Rovaniemi Railway Station" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So instead of an awfully long travel day with lots of hurry and stress we slept in, ate a good breakfast in our Hotel in Saariselk√§, and then took the 11 o‚Äôclock Bus to Rovaniemi, where we arrived several hours later. The next day, again after a good breakfast at Hostel Caf√© Koti, we walked with our <a href="https://tidd.ly/2R9MMFx">‚àû luggage</a> to the Railway Station and took the train back south. As you can imagine, such a travel arrangement is much more comfortable than a day where you get up at 6 am and are stressed till 22 o‚Äôclock when you finally arrive at home. So what did we do in Rovaniemi?</p>

<h2 id="the-capital-of-lapland">The Capital of Lapland</h2>

<p>Our Bus from Saariselk√§ dropped us off in the centre of Rovaniemi, just a short stroll from our accommodation, the beautiful <a href="https://hostelcafekoti.fi">Hostel Caf√© Koti</a>. This beautiful Hostel is a few years old and is located in a completely renovated bank building - the old offices are now rooms - there‚Äôs singles, doubles and family rooms, as well as dormitories. Downstairs you have a Caf√© where breakfast is served and where throughout the day you can drink good coffee and tea, and also enjoy some snacks.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51169792143/in/photostream/" title="Hostel Caf√© Koti"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51169792143_7d001c901c_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Hostel Caf√© Koti" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After checking in we brought the ski bag to the very safe luggage storage - an old strong room - and went to the top floor, where our beautiful room was. While I usually sleep in tents in the middle of nowhere, I do appreciate good design and beautiful interiors, and our room at Koti - which means <em>Home in Finnish</em> - was delightful. Natural materials, natural colours, lots of windows with great views - it‚Äôs the kind of room which is very inviting. The beds were fantastic, too - and I already felt like a wee nap wouldn‚Äôt be harmful ü•± But we had some other plans - we wanted to explore wintery Rovaniemi!</p>

<p>Hostel Caf√© Koti is located 2 minutes form the main square of Rovaniemi - but we were headed to the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ibhLU94L868fybGg8">Angry Birds Playground</a> which is also just 300 m away from the Hostel, and was more what we wanted after a day of travelling by Bus. This Playground is free to use, and has many really cool Angry Birds-themed playground equipment - perfect for a child, even if he‚Äôs more familiar with other games!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51169791658/in/dateposted/" title="Angry Birds Park"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51169791658_8bf7fcd05a_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Angry Birds Park" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After enjoying the playground we went for a stroll along the shore of the river. If you‚Äôre inclined, you also could go XC Skiing here, as there‚Äôs a Track going along it. We sticked to walking, and took in the view over to Ounasvaara - a real outdoor paradise if you‚Äôre living in the city, where you can go Fatbiking with <a href="https://www.rolloutdoors.com/en/">RollOutdoors</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning</a> and hiking.</p>

<p>We continued more direction town again, though - our stomachs were wishing for food, and my son wished for Hamburgers, so we visited <a href="http://www.kauppayhtio.fi/en">Kauppayhti√∂</a> where we both enjoyed tasty (vegetarian) Burgers üçî. They claim to have the best Burgers in town, and we definitely were happy with ours. The whole place is nicely decorated too - if you like a sort of 50s/ 60s Punk-Rock-Galleria Vibe, that is!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51170661065/in/dateposted/" title="Burger @ Kauppayhti√∂"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51170661065_898a42353c_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Burger @ Kauppayhti√∂" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On the way home to Koti we strolled through the centre of Rovaniemi, which was very nicely illuminated and also still had some Christmas decorations up - Santa Claus doesn‚Äôt life far from here, so I guess that natural =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51169793948/in/dateposted/" title="Rovaniemi Central Square"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51169793948_eda7da734d_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Rovaniemi Central Square" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Back at the Hostel we checked out the Sauna and then went to play <a href="https://amzn.to/3ffbNr4">‚àû Carcassone</a> at the common room. We love boardgames and if a Hostel/ Hotel/ Caf√© has Boardgames available it‚Äôs just a question of time till someone suggests a game! After several games it was time to hit the hay, and finally we were able to lay down in these inviting and comfortable beds.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51168893812/in/dateposted/" title="Hostel Caf√© Koti in Rovaniemi"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51168893812_ec6751c5ac_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Hostel Caf√© Koti in Rovaniemi" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We slept great in our room, and woke up fresh the next morning - but with rumbling stomachs! Off to the breakfast we went, in the beautiful Caf√©. It was pretty full - the Breakfast is also open to people who do not stay at the Hostel, and of these there were quite some. I guess that alone tells you it‚Äôs a good place, if locals come to eat Breakfast there!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51170672465/in/dateposted/" title="Breakfast at Hostel Caf√© Koti"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51170672465_19573230fc_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Breakfast at Hostel Caf√© Koti" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The breakfast options for Vegans were a bit limited, but I got enough to eat nevertheless - and the coffee was very good, so that definitely was a big plus. After that we went to play some more Boardgames and chill at the common room, before we walked to the railway station to travel south and home to Vaasa.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51169792268/in/dateposted/" title="Common room at Hostel Caf√© Koti"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51169792268_e6c38e941c_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Common room at Hostel Caf√© Koti" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>While it might seem we didn‚Äôt do a lot in Rovaniemi, we feel we did exactly the right amount of things in Rollo - explore the town a bit, relax, eat good food, and make the trip South a lot less stressful. That‚Äôs what we wanted, and that‚Äôs exactly what we got! If you travel with public transportation (the on-the-ground-kind) to Lapland, we can recommend travelling in two days south. Getting to <a href="https://www.visitrovaniemi.fi">discover more of Rovaniemi</a> is always worth it - there‚Äôs so much to see here, and the <a href="http://hostelcafekoti.fi/">Hostel Caf√© Koti</a> is a great place in the centre of town to stay. On our next trip North and South, we‚Äôll make sure stop here again, that‚Äôs for sure - we love relaxed, slow travelling!</p>

<p>We start in Mullerthal on <a href="https://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en/fiche/walking/stage-trail-mullerthal-trail-route-3">Route 3</a> and after a while we pass the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/02/mullerthal-trail-route-2.html">Schiessent√ºmpel waterfall</a> again. We continue past it in a southern direction, climbing some stairs which take us high above the stream where we walk on a soft trail under green beech trees. It does not take long for beautiful rock formations to appear on the side of the trail, and I enjoy the view of them - it appears like a large wall, just very pretty! We cross a street and hike onwards to the Kalktuffquelle, two small pools which are ‚ÄúThe Source of the Sandstone of Luxembourg‚Äù as a sign tells. It is a pretty spot and I spend some time taking photos and videos at it - there‚Äôs a handful of brown trouts swimming in the lower pool and Martin and me try to count how many we can see.</p>

<p>After many long exposure photos and videos we continue on the trail to Blumenthal, this time on a wooden bridge which runs next to the ‚Äú<em>Black Ernz</em>‚Äù stream. As it has been raining the wooden planks are unbelievably slippery and we are very careful while hiking over them, sort of relieved when we reach the end and hike up into the forest again.</p>

<p>At the small Rippsmuer Swamp there‚Äôs a big wooden table and benches, and as we picked up some Picnic goodies from the <a href="https://www.mullerthal-millen.lu/en/touristcenter/picnic">Heringer Millen Tourist Centre</a> in the morning we have a long and relaxed lunch - it‚Äôs even not raining, so we enjoy the good food we carried along. After Lunch we take a look at the small swamp, but as it is autumn there‚Äôs not much to be seen in terms of flowers and insects.</p>

<p>The trail continues on a forest road and we avoid large puddles of water along the tracks, but soon we‚Äôre back in the forest on a dry single trail. We make the small detour to the sun dial up on a cliff, but with the absence of the sun - it‚Äôs cloudy and grey - we simply continue hiking.</p>

<p>Green and wet beech trees surround us, and it is calm. There‚Äôs an occasional bird song, but mainly we only hear our own steps and the wind when it goes through the leafs of the trees. Along the ground we can see toadstools with their red heads and white dots on them through the ferns and undergrowth, and then it does not take long and we hike through a steep ravine down to the village of Blumenthal.</p>

<p>We cross the busy road next to the Black Ernz stream, and on the other side have again a short break. I do some stretching as I had some pain in my foot, but after taking off my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/03/all-the-shoes.html">shoes</a> and air my feet I feel better and can continue. A trailrunner overtakes us on the path, which runs next to a meadow. Then the trail takes a turn to the right and climbs up into the forest, just to spit us out into a field, where we continue. We reach a pair of trees - an Apple and a Walnut tree, which are the highest point of today and are at the Houbierg view point. We can see Berdorf and its water tower in the distance.</p>

<p>On small tracks we walk between the fields and keep an eye out for the signs here in the open, but miss one and make a small detour before we find back on the track. Along the way we did pick some very tasty apples from a tree, a tasty snack and available in abundance in this region!</p>

<p>Soon we pass through the tiny village of Soup, and in this grey weather a warm soup would have been welcome! We‚Äôre now only concentrating on reaching Larochette - a view on the weather forecast says it might start to rain any time soon, and we‚Äôd rather avoid getting soaking wet. The next bit of trail is pretty, especially the sections which take us through a beautiful green tree tunnel and then high above the town of Larochette, from where we observe the castle which towers above it.</p>

<p>We hike down into the town, along the square and continue onwards to the <a href="https://youthhostels.lu/en/youth-hostels/youth-hostel-larochette">Larochette Youth Hostel</a>, which is located in a beautiful blue building not far from the centre of the village. We moved into our small apartment, and the usual spreading out of all gear so that it can dry, a warm shower and putting on the clean clothes which were waiting for us, thanks to the <a href="https://www.movewecarry.lu">MoveWeCarry</a>, the free service which transports your luggage from accommodation to accommodation while we only carried our day hiking gear!</p>

<p>After a plentiful breakfast at the Youth Hostel we drop off the <a href="https://tidd.ly/3djoxgt">‚àû luggage</a> again for MoveWeCarry and‚Ä¶ decide to skip the next section to Beaufort. It‚Äôs raining so much, and with the morning section of the trail going over the highest part of the complete Mullerthal Trail, over fields without any protection from the forest, we simply take the free Bus to Beaufort.</p>

<p>When we arrive in Beaufort it still is raining so we continue to walk to the <a href="https://beaufortcastles.com">Beaufort castle</a> - or actually castles, as there‚Äôs two next to each other. We buy a ticket for the guided tour which starts at 11:00 o‚Äôclock and explore in the meantime the old castle with its towers and dungeons!</p>

<p>And then our Guided Tour started, and we went across a small bridge into the Renaissance Castle. We stood with our small group in the rain, listening to the Guide telling the Stories in Dutch and German, and then also got to go inside!</p>

<p>There was a lot of interesting things to see and the guided tour went quick - but at the end of it it stopped to rain! We ate the rest of our picnic lunch in the castle, tried the famous Cassero blackcurrant liqueur which is still today produced in the castle and then bade farewell to it, ready for hiking. As the Mullerthal Trail goes past the Beaufort Castle we didn‚Äôt have to go far till we reached the trail either, and soon we were again in the pretty surroundings of beech trees and rock formations!</p>

<p>I did not expect anything of this section of the trail, but was very positively surprised: It was gorgeous. The trail runs next to the small ‚ÄúHaupeschbaach‚Äù which offers lots of small waterfalls along the way, which meant: More long exposures! I carried the <a href="https://youtu.be/QC_Ox0pgK84">Sony a6600 camera</a>, which Sony loaned me, on this section and it did really well with the long exposures, even if I didn‚Äôt have any Filters for it!</p>

<p>Now while I was very pleased about the possibility to take long exposures of the waterfalls, Martin was less enthusiastic about the constant breaks.</p>

<p>It was also busy on this section of the trail - a group of US Americans passed us, as well as some Dutch Hikers and a photographer who was here for the same reason as me. But this only seemed ‚Äúbusy‚Äù as we hadn‚Äôt seen other hikers on the other days, or as many. I guess on a sunny weekend it will be a lot more busy than on this rainy &amp; wet October afternoon!</p>

<p>After a while we entered the Hallerbachtal, a narrow valley with the small stream running through it, and many wooden bridges making you cross from side to side. It‚Äôs a beautiful valley with impressive rock formations, but before long we left the forested valley and came out into an open, wide valley where we were greeted by black cows.</p>

<p>We passed the Mansion from <a href="https://amzn.to/3mVxHTt">‚àû Resident Evil</a> on the way and were wondering what the kind people of the Umbrella Cooperation were doing up there, and were happy to put some kilometres between the centre of the Zombie outbreak and us. As the trails here down in the valley were great and it started to rain üåß again it didn‚Äôt take us long and to leave that Mansion on the hill behind us. Hiking along the fields and under the yellow leafs üçÇ, with a light mist hanging in the air, it was beautiful. And so we were soon back at the Heringer Millen in Mullerthal and finished the <a href="https://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en/fiche/walking/stage-trail-mullerthal-trail-route-3">Route 3 of the Mullerthal Trail</a>.</p>

<h2 id="practicalities---where-to-stay-what-to-eat-and-how-to-get-around">Practicalities - Where to Stay, What to Eat and How to get Around</h2>

<p>We stayed at the <a href="https://lecigalon.lu">H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon</a> in Mullerthal for one night, where we also ate. It was a good room and tasty food, though the portions were possibly a bit small for hungry hikers =)</p>

<p>In Larochette we slept in an apartment at the <a href="https://youthhostels.lu/en/youth-hostels/youth-hostel-larochette">Larochette Youth Hostel</a> where we also ate. The food was really good, as was the service, and our small apartment was actually pretty large and a group of six could easily sleep in there.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, we only carried our hiking gear and our luggage was transported for free by <a href="https://www.movewecarry.lu">MoveWeCarry</a> - a service which is available to all hikers on the Mullerthal Trail, and an excellent service for those that do not want to carry everything from accommodation to accommodation.</p>

<p>At the Tourist Information Heringer Millen in Mullerthal you can buy a <a href="https://www.mullerthal-millen.lu/en/touristcenter/picnic">picnic basket with tasty local &amp; regional food</a>. If you still need some hiking boots, a day pack or umbrella - that you also can loan at the <a href="https://www.mullerthal-millen.lu/en/touristcenter/bow">Best of Wandern</a> station - for free! SO it‚Äôs definitely a good spot to start your hike, and also if you need more Infos.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/en/timetables-and-lines/bus/">Public bus transportation in Luxembourg</a> is free. Jump on a bus to get from one corner of the country to the other one (it‚Äôs a small country, so easy to do). The busses are plentiful and seem to stop even in the smallest villages, so hiking the Mullerthal Trail - or skipping a section in the rain - is easy to do.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Trapped in my Social Media bubble, I ran less and less because I didn‚Äôt have the time to run an hour or four each day. Until I realized: Short 20 Minute runs are my way to happiness, and totally fine.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51113118243/in/dateposted/" title="Swans!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51113118243_26287676b9_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Swans!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In my Social Media bubble (so the people I follow and interact with) the average person runs a 5:30 min/ km Pace, runs almost every day of the week and usually runs for an hour or longer. That wasn‚Äôt me even at the best of times: I have a family and going out for a run every day for more than an hour is impossible - unless I want to get up at 5:00 o‚Äôclock in the morning to realize that, and that is not going to happen either. At the best of times - during holidays for example - I can manage to get out two to three times a week for 30 to 60 minutes of training, and that‚Äôs already a lot.</p>

<p>This had as a result that during a normal week I ran less and less. I was trapped in the thinking of ‚ÄúIf I can not go run for an hour I don‚Äôt need to bother at all‚Äù. And with two small kids, a partner I also want to spend time with, household work and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/skullsandpaints/">another hobby I really enjoy</a> finding 1,5 hours or more - because I need to change into my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">running clothes</a>, go run, come home, go to the shower and clean up my running kit - it‚Äôs not just ‚Äú<em>One hour of running</em>‚Äù - is in my current life situation impossible.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51113994765/in/dateposted/" title="Slow and happy"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51113994765_412ecee935_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Slow and happy" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But for me less running is also not good. Running is my stress-relief, a time where I don‚Äôt need to think about work stuff, doing the Taxes, articles to write, videos to edit and household work to do. I only concentrate on the trail in front of me, and where I should place my next step or two. I also can stop a moment and listen to the sounds of the forest, or observe the swan couple which has moved to the stream in our neighbourhood and smell the trees, moss and mud. But generally I simply enjoy running on the beautiful and varied single-track in the forest, and the exercise it gives me - because working from home means for me also that I don‚Äôt move as much as I‚Äôd like to.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51113995020/in/dateposted/" title="Swans"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51113995020_339eba4b58_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Swans" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So a couple of weeks ago I decided ‚Äú<em>Whatever, I now go run for 20 Minutes</em>‚Äù and it has been a revelation, to say the least. Going running for 20 minutes gives me all of the above benefits - moving and exercising, getting my head free, enjoying the forest and nature - and including changing clothes and taking a shower afterwards I have a turn-around time of less than 40 minutes. That means I basically can set the <em>iltapalaa</em> (evening snack) for the kids on the table, change into my clothes, go run 20 minutes, take a shower and be back with them when they are finished, ready to go to sleep.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51113993970/in/dateposted/" title="Sweaty"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51113993970_09426b4ab0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Sweaty" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51113209771/in/dateposted/" title="Leaving trails"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51113209771_79e51e17de_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Leaving trails" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And so I have been running every day since that revelation. Yes, ‚Äúonly‚Äù 20 minutes - a stark difference to 99% of my Social Media bubble - but I know that I don‚Äôt intend to run an Ultra Race or Marathon any time soon and these short runs are perfect for me. After all, I run for myself, and not for some Strava records or people I don‚Äôt know on Social Media. I run for me, my health, my mental well-being, and running just 20 minutes a day makes me happy!</p>

<p>And that‚Äôs what I want to pass on to you, too. If you haven‚Äôt been running or exercising because you don‚Äôt have the one or more hour it takes - because that‚Äôs what everyone else around you does - break out of that bubble, do what makes you happy for 20 minutes and then be double happy - happy that you were running/ exercising and happy that you were able to fit it inside of a busy day, which would have prevented you of doing it any longer! Trust me, doing what you want to do, even just for a short amount of time, is better than not doing the thing at all because you feel you can not dedicate an hour or more to it. We are doing this for fun, so it is better to do it just for a bit than not at all!</p>

<p>I bought a couple of years ago some cold weather/ winter running kit from <a href="https://tidd.ly/3wOAjqJ">‚àû inov-8</a> so that I could continue running in the winter, which after all last some six months here in Vaasa, Finland. While it is ‚Äúspring‚Äù according to my calendar at the moment, when I go out run in the evenings it usually is around 0¬∞C so I am very happy for my toasty warm <a href="https://tidd.ly/2OHBBma">‚àû Winter Tight</a> in combination with their <a href="https://tidd.ly/3g6RFte">‚àû Base Elite Longsleeve</a> and a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/arcteryx-atom-sl-hoody-synthetic-jacket-bf/?pid=10239">‚àû Synthetic insulation Jacket</a> which keeps my torso warm. If it is really cold I also put on some <a href="https://tidd.ly/3dV5KHu">‚àû gloves</a> but usually these stay in my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/ultimate-direction-mountain-belt-hip-bag/?pid=10239">‚àû hip belt</a> where I also store my phone and water. On my head I have a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/buff-microfiber-reversible-hat-beanie/?pid=10239">‚àû Buff Beanie</a> which is really thin and which I usually wear under a helmet when I go skitouring, but it works well for running, too! I track my runs with the <a href="https://tidd.ly/3mGydoa">‚àû Suunto Spartan Ultra</a> which I use now since 5 or so years on all my trips and for training, and which is a superb smart watch. As I wrote in my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/03/all-the-shoes.html">All the Shoes</a> article a few weeks ago, I mix things up shoe-wise but for the last muddy weeks I only have used the <a href="https://tidd.ly/328zBX8">‚àû inov-8 Mudclaw G 260</a> and they have been performing great on the mud, snow and ice which currently is all over my trail. This kit has worked well for me now for three winters and gets a big üëç from me!</p>

<p>I own more shoes than my wife. I blame the multitude of activities I partake in for the amount of shoes in my closet, as well as my desire to try out new technologies. In this article are all but one pair of shoes which I have used in the last 16 months - the notable absence are the <a href="https://bit.ly/2BFopb7">‚àû Luna Sandals OSO Flaco</a> which are my much-loved summer sandals, which I will review at a later point. Many of the shoes in this article are made for specific activities but I tend to use all shoes at a minimum for hiking and some every-day use. Anyway, let‚Äôs jump in!</p>

<h2 id="la-sportiva-trango-ice-cube-gtx">La Sportiva Trango Ice Cube GTX</h2>

<p><strong>Weight</strong>: One Boot 697 g, Pair 1397 g // <strong>Size</strong>: 42 // <strong>Buy them</strong> at <a href="https://bit.ly/2PxQF61">‚àû La Sportiva</a>, <a href="https://tidd.ly/3sByUl4">‚àû Bergzeit</a> (currently 12% off), <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/la-sportiva-trango-ice-cube-gtx-mountaineering-boots/?pid=10239">‚àû Bergfreunde</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/3u3LCJz">‚àû Backcountry</a> or find the best deals on <a href="https://www.outdoordeals.com">Outdoordeals.com</a>!</p>

<p>The La Sportiva Trango Ice Cube GTX are my ice climbing boots (which means they are fully crampon compatible!) - but as I climb less ice nowadays (simply less time) I have used these boots for the most part as winter hiking boots. For many years I have tried to get away in winter with using trailrunning shoes, but as soon as some snow is involved low shoes fill up with snow, which equals wet socks, which means cold feet. I am not fond of cold &amp; wet feet, and hence the La Sportiva Trango Ice Cube GTX come since two years on every time I go into the snow in winter - these are mid-high boots with a super nice integrated gaiter, which closes around my leg and hence there‚Äôs no snow coming inside the boot or socks!</p>

<p>Another problem of trailrunning shoes is that I mostly use unlined shoes, and that means the wind goes through - and again cold feet are the result. The Trango Ice Cube GTX have an upper which is made in a seamless construction method and have an Gore-Tex Insulated Comfort lining that keeps my feet toasty and warm, even at <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/03/fatbiking-in-saariselka.html">-25¬∞C in Lapland</a>. I have used these boots for hiking, cycling, skiing with OAC Skinbased skis and also ice-climbing and mountaineering, as well as pottering around in the snow. I like that they are relatively lightweight, the high gaiter is ideal for my kind of activities and keeps the snow out, and they are toasty warm when moving around in the cold. If you need a warm pair of winter boots which you also can take climbing in the mountains, then I can strongly recommend the La Sportiva Trango Ice Cube GTX!</p>

<h2 id="on-cloudventure-peak">ON Cloudventure Peak</h2>

<p>I have been trailrunning in these shoes for over two years now (switching around with other shoes!) and really like them. They have a wide-ish toe box, a good fit in the heel cup, a very thin tongue which make these shoes almost feel like a sock and the sole gives great grip on all sorts of surfaces: Mud, granite rocks and trails full of roots. On asphalt sections and hard gravel roads they weren‚Äôt perfect - the ‚ÄúClouds‚Äù as these open sections of the sole are called do have good cushioning on trails, but on roads I find them less good - and as they are not made for road running, I only use them on the short sections to get to the trail. But yeah, the sock-like fit, together with the thin, breathable upper, make this a great shoe for running in the summer. The laces are really good, too - a tad long, but they stayed closed, even on long runs. And the sole has good grip and cushioning as mentioned already. But do the Zero-Gravity heel Clouds provide softer landings, as they claim? I can not agree nor disagree with it to be honest. Does that make them less good? Hell no! I‚Äôm always happy to go running in these shoes - and they fit well in with my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning outfit</a>, too!</p>

<p>I received these in January 2020 and they have become my Every-day use shoes after the snow is gone and before it gets really warm (as then I prefer to wear Sandals). Besides walking to the Kindergarden and along the coast I also use them for easy day hikes, cycling and scrambling =) These are Black Diamond‚Äôs first entry into the Footwear market, and after using them for over a year I think they have done a good job. The sock-like fit is great: It‚Äôs easy to slip into the shoes for example, and if you have them on there‚Äôs nothing rubbing you the wrong way, so they are really comfortable. The upper is made from one piece and claimed to be very breathable, which is true to a certain temperature - at temperatures over 20¬∞C I do get sweaty feet in them. The rubber sole is really excellent on rock and it‚Äôs nice to scramble up the big rocks which the last Ice Age left here in Vaasa - precise placements are no problem. The sole is also surprisingly durable for all the asphalt walking I have done in them over the past year, which is very positive. Overall a really lightweight and grippy shoe, which I use with pleasure - I hope to test them in the mountains soon, approaching some climbs!</p>

<p>I bought these shoes last year and used them on my backpacking &amp; packrafting trip in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/lemmenjoki-national-park.html">Lemmenjoki National Park</a>, and was a bit disappointed that the toe cap came lose after just 60 km of hiking. Also the Graphene rubber sole, which is claimed to be more durable, has not lived up to the hype in my opinion - but then maybe I hiked too much over very hard granite rocks for long stretches, which is a very taxing underground on all soles - especially if I consider that these Mudclaw shoes are made for muddy and wet trails. In those conditions they have been very good, giving great grip with their deep lugs in the mud, and no chance of slipping. I love the close feel to the ground in these shoes, and they have been comfortable even on 40 km days across the wilderness of Lapland. The overall durability is a bit of a let-down though, as I expected more from the Graphene soles - maybe I have to pick up the <a href="https://tidd.ly/39nPT2K">‚àû Roclite G 275</a> and see if it is lasting longer on hard rock surfaces. For the time being, I‚Äôll continue to go running and hiking in these Mudclaw G 260 though.</p>

<p>After years of not using any <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/salomon-speedcross-3.html">Salomon Speecross Shoes</a> I got these S-Lab Speedcross shoes three years ago - and damn, are they good! As <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">I wrote in 2018</a>: These S-Lab shoes are light, have great grip, are comfortable and have ‚Äúno ankle support‚Äù. But after running in them for 2+ years I can report I haven‚Äôt had any problems running in them and the lack of ‚Äúankle support‚Äù is not an issue for me. I still don‚Äôt like that the pocket for the laces is designed badly (newer Salomon shoes do that much better!), but other than that these are great Speedcross shoes which convince with great grip, fit and comfort also on long runs. I expect these will continue to be good for a year or two, as I pretty much only use them for running or the occasional hike so the durability of the sole has been very good.</p>

<p>I bought these in February 2020 as I am fed-up with the super slippery roads we have in winter in Vaasa, and after I fell on my buttocks a few times over the past years I decided enough is enough. These are trailrunning shoes with spikes, and have no lining - which also makes them somewhat ‚Äúcold‚Äù in really cold weather. But the main reason these shoes are brilliant are the 16 studs which ensure bomb-proof grip on even the smoothest of ice! That grip is absolutely fantastic and I haven‚Äôt felt insecure on icey roads even once this winter! The bluesign upper is smooth, pretty durable and also water repellent but not waterproof - I have gotten moist feet when using them in deeper snow, so I try to stay clear of that. The sock-like fit is very comfortable and also on runs these have performed very good, ensuring I can continue to run in even the most slippery conditions. Overall a great shoe that ensures I stay upright even on mirror-like ice roads and trails!</p>

<p>These shoes I got as a Test sample on the last #OutDoorFN fair in Friedrichshafen, and have used them on-and-off over the past three years. The footbed and upper are fully customized to my feet for a personalized and unique fit, as much like a ski boot these shoes can be moulded to your feet. And yes, these are comfortable shoes, which I have used hiking, cycling and walking around in town. The Vibram Megagrip sole is great on wet and dry trails alike, but the black mesh upper does tend to get dirty and it‚Äôs not that easy to clean. The shoe is also pretty warm and nothing I can use in the summer, but for right now and these wet, cold and ice-free seasons I find them really good. However, it‚Äôs also a ‚Äúheavy‚Äù shoe and it stands quite high above the ground - something I had to get used to, as I prefer to use shoes with a low or Zero Drop which allow me to be close to the ground. But even if they aren‚Äôt the shoes I‚Äôd use on long hikes, I do think that these are good shoes, especially for people who want a perfect fit, great grip and don‚Äôt mind the higher weight.</p>

<p>And that are all the shoes I used in the last 16+ months - quite a wide selection, and several shoes actually have been used for even longer, but as I continue to get plenty of DMs and question on Social Media about my shoes I though it is about time to answer all these questions in one go! By the way, I also used the previously reviewed <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/la-sportiva-crossover-2-dot-0-gtx.html">La Sportiva Crossover 2.0</a> on several hikes in the past year - but then they started to smell after the last hike so badly I had to dispose them!

<p>My son and me were in Lapland in February, by now already something of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/02/father-son-ski-trip.html">a little tradition</a> for us two. It‚Äôs a great way to bond, talk, have fun together and experience the beauty of our home country. I this case we went to <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/fi/">Saariselk√§</a>, a small village in the North-East of Finland, which I have <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/10/mountainbiking-in-lapland.html">visited</a> <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/urho-kekkonen-national-park.html">numerous</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/-AYVkZf61UE">times</a> over the past years as it‚Äôs located very close to several National Parks, Wilderness areas and is simply a great starting point for outdoor adventures. While we were hiking and skiing in Saariselk√§ also this time, we went on three different <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/open-fell-biking/">Fatbike rides in Saariselk√§ and Kiilop√§√§</a>. As our family are cycling enthusiasts - we still don‚Äôt own a car! - trying out Fatbikes was something that my son and me both looked forward too!</p>

<h2 id="fatbiking-in-kiilop-and-urho-kekkonen-nationalpark">Fatbiking in Kiilop√§√§ and Urho Kekkonen Nationalpark</h2>

<p>Our first trip was with Tuija from the <a href="http://openfellbiking.com/">MTB Project</a> and Raili from <a href="https://www.rolloutdoors.com/fi/kiilopaa/">Roll Outdoors</a>. These two women were fantastic guides and showed us the best and most scenic trails around Kiilop√§√§, and they even organized some glorious weather for us as you can see in the photos ‚òÄÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏èüòé My son and me took the Ski Bus from Saariselk√§ to Kiilop√§√§, a short 20 minute ride which takes you through the beautiful landscape. We met Raili and Tuija at the Roll Outdoors HQ and picked up our Fatbikes: They have e-Fatbikes, Kids Fatbikes, and the Canyon Dude 8.0 Fatbike which we rode. After a short introduction to the bikes and the plan for the day we started to ride through the Gates of the Urho Kekkonen National Park, and headed along the border of the National Park towards the Kiilop√§√§ Snow Bike Park, a good area to get familiar with the bikes in easy terrain and to see what they are capable off. The trails were freshly groomed and it was great riding on these fine trails.</p>

<p>The trails are well marked, and you can get a map to see where you are allowed to ride. Not all trails are allowed for Fatbikes - as tempting as it is to ride on the hard, flat XC Skiing trails: These are off-limits! There are over 50 km of Fatbike Trails, either pure bike trails or then open to both hikers and cyclists. We did encounter on our rides just a handful of hikers, who were always very friendly and excited to see us. Just make sure to slow down or even get off when you pass people, and all can use these trails together happily! We had a short break at the bottom of the Snow Bike Park at a Laavu, and then cycled a different route back to Kiilop√§√§, where we made a proper lunch break.</p>

<p>After good coffee and hot juice, tasty vegan food and chocolate bananas we rode the trail up to Ahonp√§√§t. The views from the trail - we were there right at the Golden Hour, which always gets me a bit excited and I have the urge to just stop every 100 m and take photos üòÜ - were breath-taking. Not just because of the long up-hill, but also because of the magnificent views.</p>

<p>The trees were absolutely beautiful, fully hiding beneath the snow, a warm, golden light was making everything look beautiful and all four of us were just smiling from ear to ear. A moment to remember.</p>

<p>After all the uphill it was time to turn the Fatbikes around and point our tires down and back to Kiilop√§√§! Timo, the <a href="https://www.pallasyllasoutdoors.com">local trail builder</a>, has created a wonderfully flow-trail which gives you great views while you descent. You should <a href="https://youtu.be/WRvGZ18se0o">watch the video</a> to see what I mean, the photos simply don‚Äôt do it justice of how beautiful this trail is!</p>

<p>Happy, and a wee bit cold, we arrived back at the Roll Outdoors Shop in Kiilop√§√§, and went inside of the <a href="https://www.kiilopaa.fi">Suomen Latu</a> building to have a hot chocolate. It was a fantastic day, and both my son and me look back fondly to it!</p>

<h2 id="fatbiking-around-saariselk-village">Fatbiking around Saariselk√§ village</h2>

<p>The next day we rented bikes from <a href="https://www.laplandsafaris.com/en/activities-in-lapland/cycling-and-winter-fat-biking">Lapland Safaris</a> in Saariselk√§ and went on a self-guided trip. As it was snowing and again pretty cold, we decided to ride to the Savottakahvila Caf√© in Laanila, which was a good choice. It was at some point almost a wee Blizzard and it was hard to see far, so we both were happy when we reached the Caf√© and could have a hot chocolate and a Laskiaispulla!</p>

<p>There was an old Prospector‚Äôs cottage close by, and as we both are interested in geology we tried to go there - sadly there‚Äôs no Fatbike trail going to it, and as we didn‚Äôt want to break the Rules we headed back on the same trail to Saariselk√§. By now the weather also started to be a bit more sunny, so it was nice to ride the trails with a fresh cover of snow and in the sunshine ‚òÄÔ∏è‚ùÑ !</p>

<p>On our last day in Saariselk√§ we went Fatbiking with Guide Janne from Lapland Safaris. We got the same bikes as on the previous trip, which was great as they were all dialled in to our heights, and then we took off after Janne!</p>

<p>This time we went a bit off-the-beaten-track and road our Fatbikes towards the west on a Trail which I had hiked back in the autumn of 2019, before turning south and then east again towards Laanila. It was yet again a very snowy and cold day, and big snow flakes were coming down from the grey clouds. The trail was well-maintained but the snow kept growing on it, making for good riding.</p>

<p>In the middle of the forest we had a break, drunk some hot, tasty juice which gave us back some warmth, and ate a little snack, while playing with the new, soft snow around us, all while it continued to snow. So much beautiful snow! After this wee break we rode on, arriving at Laanila and then continuing on a familiar trail back to the village.</p>

<p>Fatbiking in Saariselk√§ and Kiilop√§√§ was a fantastic winter activity for us. My son got better at riding with each time we rode our Fatbikes, and he really enjoyed the flowy downhill sections of the trails (he didn‚Äôt care that much about uphills, but then: Few do üòÅ). While he didn‚Äôt fall he did at some points simply on purpose fell into the deep, soft snow which is surrounding the trail, which makes for a soft and safe landing. I was happy about the variety of trails available for us, and that many are easy enough for younger children - though I do hope more demanding and longer trails will get built in the next winter! Overall this was a great alternative to XC or downhill skiing, and allowed us to explore the nature at our own speed - faster than hiking, but slow enough to take in the details of the nature surrounding us. Right now in March and April, with the <em>hankikanto</em> (that time of the year where the top snow layer is carrying people and bikes without that you break through) it is also possible to ride almost everywhere, and especially on the open fells and lakes this makes for fun, good riding. But then you still have these awesome trails, which you really should ride!</p>

<p>We stayed in an Apartment at the <a href="https://www.laplandhotels.com/FI/lapin-hotellit/saariselka/lapland-hotels-riekonlinna.html">Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna Hotel</a> which has an ideal location: 5 minutes from the Store and even less time to be on a trail for skiing, Fatbiking or hiking. The <a href="https://skisaariselka.com/ski-bus/">Ski Bus</a> stops in front of the building, as are the buses to the south and north.</p>

<p>Our Apartment had all the amenities we could have wished for: A Sauna, comfortable beds, a well-equipped kitchen and a drying closet for drying all our sweaty and wet clothes!</p>

<p>We ate breakfast and dinner at the Hotel, and they served great Vegan food - I really appreciated that! In the afternoons, after we returned from our activities, we usually would sit down at the fire place in the lobby and have a hot chocolate. There are several other Restaurants and Take-Away options in the village, or then we also could have cooked in our apartment.</p>

<p>As usual we travelled by public transportation to Lapland, but if you are not alone then drive your car north - then you are mobile there. Taking the Bus from Rovaniemi to Saariselk√§ is a short and scenic 3 hour ride, and it really gets you in the mood for the outdoors as you ride past lakes and forests and every so often slow down to let the Reindeer get off the road. Taking an (overnight) train to Rovaniemi from Southern Finland is also very convenient, as you wake up well rested and just a short ride away from your next outdoor adventure. This is also a good way to travel if you want to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/outdoors-in-helsinki.html">explore Helsinki</a> before or after a visit in Lapland - or stop for some days in <a href="">Rovaniemi</a> while you are here. Finally, if you come from abroad you also can fly directly to Ivalo, from where you can take a bus or Taxi to Saariselk√§.</p>

<p>In Saariselk√§ you have a great outdoor shop, several Caf√©s and Restaurants and a grocery store. Make sure to read the <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/2020/10/14/travel-safely/">Travel Safely</a> website, use a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/10/reuseable-face-masks.html">Reuseable Face Mask</a> and do all those things which you should do to minimize the risk of getting ill. Other than that - enjoy your holiday in Saariselk√§, Lapland!</p>

<p>Travelling safely during the Covid-19 Pandemic is possible in Finland (with some caveats, more about these <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel/status/1361235118329913344">here</a>) and so my 9-year old son and me travelled to <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/en/">Saariselk√§</a> - long-time readers will remember my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/10/mountainbiking-in-lapland.html">autumn</a> trip there. Saariselk√§ is a tranquil little village with 300 inhabitants and lays at the gates of the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/urho-kekkonen-national-park.html">Urho Kekkonen National Park</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqEBC4yj3Faikt3HHS3jU8l3Fm8pxQvN3">Hammastunturi Wilderness</a>. It has a superb network of Fatbike and XC Skiing trails, a small but very good Ski Resort and plenty of other opportunities of enjoying the outdoors. As well as many great accommodation options, like the wonderful <a href="https://www.laplandhotels.com/EN/hotels-in-lapland/saariselka/lapland-hotels-riekonlinna.html">Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna</a> where we stayed.</p>

<p>We were exceptionally lucky with the weather - it was ‚òÄÔ∏è every day but bitterly cold, some days at low as a felt temperature of -32¬∞C - but even those temps were bearable with the <a href="https://youtu.be/E_ma70A6HkM">right clothes</a> and keeping active!</p>

<p>After we hiked the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/11/mullerthal-trail-route-1.html">Mullerthal Trail Route 1</a> in completely terrible weather, on the morning of our third day the sun is shining, some clouds are slowly moving across the blue sky and it is a nice, warm 15¬∞C outside. It‚Äôs exactly the kind of weather you want when you hike <a href="https://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en/fiche/walking/stage-trail-mullerthal-trail-route-2">Route 2 of the Mullerthal Trail</a>. This is THE Route of the Mullerthal trail, with one scenic spot after the other. Which means, if you‚Äôre a photographer like me, the going will be slow üòÜ</p>

<p>We left Echternach on foot and soon passed the Trooskn√§ppchen view point, where we took a look back on the town which was out home the past three nights. Our luggage will be awaiting us at our next home for the night, so we can hike with light packs on the trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50837888796/in/photostream/" title="Trooskn√§ppchen Viewpoint"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50837888796_a79c790175_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Trooskn√§ppchen Viewpoint" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The trail goes along the left side of the valley, on the other side of it and the river is Germany, literally a stone throw away. The trail gives nice views on this valley, and the interaction of sunshine and clouds is pretty to observe. It does not take long and we are at the first scenic viewpoint of Route 2, the Wolfsschlucht, a steep canyon in which in past times wolves were hiding. It‚Äôs an impressive sight and we enjoy it a lot, but are surprised that after you have climbed the hundreds of stairs there‚Äôs a small cauldron from which stairs go further up on both sides. We climb both sets of stairs and are rewarded by beautiful views on the valley, with sunshine on our faces ‚òÄÔ∏è</p>

<p>The trail goes on past moss-covered rocks and green beech trees, stairs down, over little bridges, impressive rock walls. A pair of Dutch hikers pass us and ask if we know where the ‚ÄúLabyrinth‚Äù is - which is the next highlight, and which was just a few hundred meters ahead of us =)</p>

<p>The Labyrinth is described as <em>‚Äúa maze of rocks‚Äù</em> but the truth is that i‚Äôs less a maze than just a bunch of rocks where the trail goes through. It‚Äôs pretty, nevertheless. For these 3 km we already needed more than an hour, because of all the photo and video breaks. We arrive at the Perekop viewpoint, and decide to not go climb it - but I briefly let the drone go up and snap some photos from up in the air. The trail now leads away from the road and deeper into a forest canyon, where we go over half a dozen bridges which go over a small stream.</p>

<p>We climb some stairs and then stand in front of the mouth of the Huel Lee cave. This is a really popular spot but the moment we arrive the only other being there with us is a small stray cat, which miaus at us. Huel Lee is a cave where the local mill stones were ‚Äúbroken‚Äù from the rock, which generated this large cave. It‚Äôs a beautiful sight, and later on we learn that this is the only place where the rock quality was right for mill stones. I take a lot of photos while Martin talks to the cat, and as we leave we try to guide it with us back to Berdorf, but the wee cat decides to stay at the cave. We hope it will be well, and walk on.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs three hours after we have left Echternach that we arrive in Berdorf, which amounts to around 2 km of speed per hour. Yeps, that is REALLY slow.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50837160748/in/photostream/" title="Towards Berdorf"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50837160748_9a63541012_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Towards Berdorf" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In Berdorf we head into the <a href="https://en.trailinn.lu">Trail-Inn</a> Caf√© &amp; Restaurant. We order some coffee and some absolutely fantastic cake, but as I order the bill we‚Äôre a bit shocked to pay 20‚Ç¨ for two coffees and pieces of üç∞! As we leave Berdorf Martin and me are very much looking forward to the next section to the M√ºllerthal, there‚Äôs a lot of scenic spots along this section of the trail. Sadly we soon find the trail closed and a Detour sign - a flood destroyed the bridges here, and currently the final bridges and paths are put into place.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50837892771/in/photostream/" title="Um Leit Ung"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50837892771_ddafb377f6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Um Leit Ung" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This detour at least speeds us up considerably, and it‚Äôs also really pretty. We‚Äôre high above the normal trail and can get (careful) glimpses of the scenery down in the valley where Route 2 would take us along - we guess we‚Äôre between 30 and 50 m high up, so standing at the lip of rocks is scary. Not long and we‚Äôre at the Binzeltschl√´ff rock formation, which throwns above a road which is very silent. I fly my Drone again, and then we cross the road and Martin and me climb and squeeze through the Priedegtstull rocks. We laugh a lot here, it‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt usually get to do and if our kids would be here, they‚Äôd love it as much as we, we realize!</p>

<p>As we arrive at the top we realize that we definitely took the most adventurous detour through the rocks, as there also would have been a very easy path up here. But probably it was a lot less fun than our route! We take a look over the land from the viewpoint, and then dive into the forest.</p>

<p>Almost at closing time we arrive at the <a href="https://www.mullerthal-millen.lu/en">Heringer Millen</a>, the tourist centre in the centre of the Mullerthal Trail network. Here you can <a href="https://www.mullerthal-millen.lu/en/touristcenter/bow">loan for free hiking gear</a>, from shoes and jackets to backpacks and even binoculars and GPS receivers. We however take a look at the beautiful old mill, and then hit the trail one last time today to hike on the C5 Trail towards the Camping place ‚Äú<a href="https://www.visitconsdorf.lu/en/camping-la-pinede/camping-la-pinede-2">La Pin√®de</a>‚Äù.</p>

<p>We stay tonight at a Mobilehome, which is nicer than it sounds.

It‚Äôs a nicely decorated place with really tasty food, and after a delicious starter, main and dessert we fall happily into our beds!</p>

<h2 id="day-2-consdorf-mllerthal---scheidgen---echternach">Day 2 Consdorf/ M√ºllerthal - Scheidgen - Echternach</h2>

<p>This was a long, sunny and enjoyable day of being outdoors in nature. After a good breakfast we hiked up to the Schiessent√ºmpel, the largest waterfall in Luxembourg and most photographed spot on the Mullerthal trail. We were lucky that there wasn‚Äôt a lot of people around this early in the morning, so after many photos and a drone flight (watch the Video!) we continued.</p>

<p>The trail leads up into the forest and we pass impressive rock formations like the Eulenburg, the Goldfralay with its little canyon and where a path leads up to the top of the cliff. It‚Äôs beautiful and we enjoy the scenery, hiking along these high rock walls.</p>

<p>We cross the street not far from the Consdorfer Millen, another mill, and are on a wide forest road while the sun climbs higher and sends its rays through the beech trees.</p>

<p>Then a narrow single trail path leads up into the forest, and not long and we are at the highlights of this section: Three very narrow canyons/ caves, two which also require a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/petzl-bindi-head-torch/?pid=10239">headlamp</a> to get through as they are completely dark. First is the Rittergang, a narrow canyon through which Martin and I squeeze, laughing about this kind of experience.</p>

<p>Next is the Deiwepetz canyon, which feels really long and the trail snakes through this even narrower canyon. It also gets pretty dark once you‚Äôre a few steps away from the entry, and I‚Äôm happy I have my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/petzl-iko-core-head-torch/?pid=10239">Petzl IKO Core</a> along.</p>

<p>We exit the Diewepetz, smiling. The sun shines, it gets warm, and we have one more canyon/ cave in front of us, the best one if we can believe our guide book! To get to the Kuelscheier cave you can hike the marked Circuit Trail, which also takes you up to a viewing point, or you can stay on the trail and get to the entry of the cave. We chose to do the circuit, and then head into the cave. It takes a turn and you‚Äôre in immediate darkness, and without some light you‚Äôre quickly falling or hurting yourself, as it is narrow, there are corners, stairs and narrow passages.</p>

<p>We exit the cave and continue on Route 2 now towards Hersberg, though shortly before the village we take a shortcut and head onwards to Scheidgen.</p>

<p>The warm weather and sunshine are very pleasant, we enjoy every moment out here in nature, being on this wonderful trail. And it does not get boring: It takes us along prehistoric grinding grooves and then leads up out of the forest and we cross some fields, before we are back in the forest. We cross small wooden bridges which allow us to keep the feet dry and take a look at the small M√©chelskierch cave which was home to a hermit in the 18. century.</p>

<p>Brown leafs from past autumns are under our feet as we hike in the sun, onwards towards Scheidgen.</p>

<p>In Scheidgen we hope into the <a href="https://lebonrepos.lu/restaurant/">Hotel Bon Repos &amp; Restaurant Le Grill</a> for lunch. Martin has a very tasty looking Hamburger while I eat a delicious salad, and we enjoy the view into the kitchen were the Chefs are preparing our food. Route 2 continues now for another 8 km till Echternach, and we hike down into a narrow, wooded valley.</p>

<p>We are passed by three Trailrunners, and now encounter also some more hikers, but not really a lot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the trail is showing itself from its most beautiful side. Light beech forests bath the trail in a warm, green-golden light, while the red-grey-green rock faces surprise us with different forms and make us smile.</p>

<p>After a few hours we arrive above Echternach and enjoy the view on the Abbey from up here in the forest. It‚Äôs funny how different it feels to come back here in warm weather and sunshine, and not soaking wet in the rain! We take a shortcut to the Campground, where we will be sleeping in a <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/sleeping-like-diogenes">Wooden Barrel</a>. We take a really nice warm shower and switch into some <a href="https://tidd.ly/3oCbf13">‚àû clean</a> and <a href="https://tidd.ly/2LeBvAU">‚àû fresh</a> <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/01/DUER-All-Weather-Denim-Jeans.html">clothes</a>, and head again to the Restaurant Aal Eechternoach for our celebratory Dinner!</p>

<h2 id="practicalities---where-to-stay-what-to-eat-and-how-to-get-around">Practicalities - Where to Stay, What to Eat and How to get Around</h2>

<p>We stayed at the start and the end of our trip in Echternach, which is a small town - the oldest in Luxembourg - which we really liked. We stayed the first three nights in the <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/tower-hamelmaous">medieval fortification tower H√§melmaous</a> which really was a beautiful experience. There‚Äôs a cozy kitchen at the ground floor, and then there‚Äôs four more floors in this round tower. It easily should sleep a family of four or more, and it‚Äôs also really close to the centre and the bus stop. At the end of our trip we slept in a <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/sleeping-like-diogenes">Wooden Barrel</a> on the Campground, which was a really cozy experience as well. I slept like a stone in my barrel, which is good for one to two persons and possibly a small child or two. The camping place is a wee bit outta town - some five to ten minutes of walking to the centre, but really close to the trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50587601737/in/dateposted/" title="Medieval fortification tower H√§melmaous"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50587601737_e6b4da72ff_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1535" alt="Medieval fortification tower H√§melmaous" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>While hiking Route 2 you can stay either at ‚Äú<a href="https://www.visitconsdorf.lu/en/camping-la-pinede/camping-la-pinede-2">La Pin√®de Camping</a>‚Äù in Consdorf or at the <a href="https://lecigalon.lu">H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon</a> in Mullerthal, both are along Route 2 and pretty much in the middle of this trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50897605248/in/dateposted/" title="H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50897605248_ebd18e5549_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Both have options for eating out - at the Camping place in Consdorf we ate at the <a href="https://www.brass.lu">Brasserie op Buergkapp</a> which was tasty and plenty, while at the 4‚≠êÔ∏è Le Cigalon the food was good but it took ages and portions are small - so if you‚Äôre hungry after a long day of hiking, pick wisely!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50900860136/in/dateposted/" title="Vegan Main at H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50900860136_f21e07c7cc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Vegan Main at H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/en/timetables-and-lines/bus/">Public bus transportation in Luxembourg</a> is free. Jump on a bus to get from one corner of the country to the other one (it‚Äôs a small country, so easy to do). The busses are plentiful and seem to stop even in the smallest villages, so hiking the Mullerthal Trail (or any other trail for that matter) in sections is easy to do.</p>

<p>Favourite gear articles are a staple of blogs and magazines at the end of the year. I see gear as an enabler to my trips, but it‚Äôs not the main thing of this hobby for me. Yes, I consider myself a Gear Nerd, and am happy to geek out about sustainable, lightweight and functional equipment &amp; garments, but being outside in nature is more important. Hence my four picks of ‚Äúfavourite gear‚Äù of 2020 actually only includes three pieces of equipment üòÜ I also want to discourage you from thinking that you have to spend ridiculous amounts of ‚Ç¨¬£$ to get this gear or go to the same places than me. Yes, it‚Äôs great kit, yes, it were amazing trips and the destinations should go on your bucket list. But at the same time: Stay local, minimize your environmental footprint and only buy what you need!</p>

<h2 id="more-time--local-trips">More Time // Local Trips</h2>

<p>I didn‚Äôt have a lot of work in 2020, which means I had a lot more ‚Äúfree‚Äù time. With the Pandemic being the main topic of 2020 and me being rather careful to not expose myself to the virus, I did not (<em>could not</em>) travel as much as usual. Instead I made the best of it and travelled locally - a few trips to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/lemmenjoki-national-park.html">Lapland</a> but mostly <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/nuku-yo-ulkona-kvarken-archipelago.html">locally in my Region</a>. This definitely was my favourite part of 2020, we had some fantastic day trips with the family where we were <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/06/sup-adventures-in-the-kvarken-archipelago.html">SUPing</a> and swimming, having picnics and enjoying the warm, sunny weather. This is something which I will continue to do in 2021 and onwards - mostly travelling in Finland, Norway and Sweden, with just the occasional work trip further abroad.</p>

<h2 id="houdini-fleece-jacket">Houdini Fleece Jacket</h2>

<p>I was thinking, while doing my research for this piece, if the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/11/patagonia-r1-air-review.html">Patagonia R1 Air</a> should be in this article. But the truth is, there is one Fleece Jacket which I have worn substantially more in 2020: The <a href="https://bit.ly/390vFwb">‚àû Houdini Power Air Houdi</a> (it‚Äôs replaced by the Mono Air Hoody nowadays!). I own also an <a href="https://bit.ly/3sJ0pJS">‚àû Outright Houdi</a> (3 years old) and a <a href="https://bit.ly/3o0F6zK">‚àû Power Houdi</a> (6 years old) and love both of those heaps, but the Power Air is what I have worn pretty much every day in 2020. A fleece jacket is part of my every day dress code (Yay for Homeoffice/ being an outdoor journalist!), which goes well with a T-Shirt underneath it and a Windjacket over it if I have to go out. My Power Air Houdi has an amazing purple colour üíú and is 633 g light in Size S - which makes it too heavy for backpacking, but perfect for everyday use and day hikes. I‚Äôve been wearing it while traveling, hiking, and working at home, and I also worn it on overnight trips and <a href="https://youtu.be/OCt38Ybiy7w">photo shoots in the middle of the night</a>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a durable piece of kit which is made from the still relatively new <a href="https://youtu.be/_DBPa0wBNZE">Polartec Power Air</a>; that fabric has a new knit construction which encapsulates air to retain warmth and reduce microfiber shedding - it sheds up to five times less microfibres as other fleece fabrics. It keeps you toasty by encapsulating the insulation in hundreds of tiny pockets, with channels running around them for greater breathability. The fabric is stretchy and the Power Air Houdi has an athletic fit, with a comfy hood for when I forgot to put my beanie on, and two zippered hand pockets if also my gloves stayed home. It‚Äôs a fantastic garment which I‚Äôm wearing while writing this article (I just went out quickly to take the underneath photo) and it makes me happy with its good features, sustainable credentials and purple colour. So it is definitely a jacket which I will continue to wear in 2021!</p>

<h2 id="anfibio-rebel-2k-packraft">Anfibio Rebel 2K packraft</h2>

<p>In the summer of 2020 I travelled to Lapland to go backpacking in the Lemmenjoki National Park and then packrafted alone down the Ivalojoki river. Along on that trip I had the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/09/anfibio-rebel-2k-the-most-versatile-packraft.html">Anfibio REBEL 2K</a> packraft, which I enjoyed from bow to stern üòÜ It‚Äôs compact, lightweight, nimble and can handle white water rafting without problems - everything I want from a packraft. I also had it along on local trips on rivers and on the Baltic Sea, and time and again it made me smile while paddling and carrying it. I‚Äôm already now planning new trips with it in the spring, summer and autumn, and if you are curious about packrafting then look no further than the Anfibio REBEL 2K packraft! <em>The best thing is that you can <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Rentals:::34.html?language=en">loan packrafts</a> starting from 70‚Ç¨ from the Packrafting Store, which is perfect if you want to try this sport without committing to a 1.000,00 ‚Ç¨ or more investment!</em></p>

<h2 id="huckepacks-phoenix">HUCKEPACKS Phoenix</h2>

<p>When Mateusz called me in 2019 and told me he will reopen his cottage, I was really happy for him! Since then I have carried his new pack creations on almost all of my trips in 2020, and the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/09/huckepacks-phoenix-lite-review.html">HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite</a> is hands-down the best backpacking rucksack I have used in the past year(s). It‚Äôs 474 g light with all bells &amp; whistles, and carries even heavy loads with lots of food like a dream. The pack handled <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/11/mullerthal-trail-route-1.html">constant rain</a> just fine, and Version 2.0 - which was released last autumn - even improves on the original design. This will also in 2021 be my pack of choice, and I can‚Äôt wait to go backpacking with it again this year!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For 10+ years, I haven‚Äôt worn any jeans. But in autumn 2019 the DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans arrived with me, and in the past two winters they have become my go-to trousers. So much so, that I am wearing it now since four months (and yes, that means it hasn‚Äôt been in the wash that long!).</p>

<p>Since around 2008 I haven‚Äôt worn a pair of jeans. My last jeans were from an Italian brand, but even when I still owned them I didn‚Äôt wear them much. My trousers, or pants, whatever you like to call them, were made from another fabric than denim. Mostly Polyester, but also linen, cotton and other synthetic fabrics were what I liked to wear, and actually still do for most of the year. But in the autumn of 2019 the <a href="https://bit.ly/3s2D4m2">‚àû DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans</a> appeared at my porch, and while I was sceptical at first - I love my Houdini pants to bits - I also was curious to try these jeans, as they feature a water repellant and breathable membrane underneath the denim fabric.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50808928773/in/dateposted/" title="DUER All-Weather Denim"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50808928773_56706b96d0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DUER All-Weather Denim" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809668396/in/dateposted/" title="Instructions // DUER All-Weather Denim"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809668396_7edd02e6f8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Instructions // DUER All-Weather Denim" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The denim fabric is what makes DUER jeans special, as it is not 100% cotton, but the fabric is called L2X Denim and consists of 70% Cotton, 28% Coolmax (that‚Äôs made from Polyester) and 2% Lycra. This makes the jeans more stretchy and rather comfortable to wear, especially for cycling. The denim fabric also has a Silvadur treatment, that‚Äôs a bacterial inhibition treatment to extend the time you can wear the jeans without washes. Right now, as depicted on the photos in this article, the jeans has been worn daily for four months without that it has been in the washing machine. My regular Houdini trousers I wear anywhere between two and four weeks, then it simply is too obvious that I have been wearing the pants for a long time because you can see dirt on them. These DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans have a quite dark fabric, which ‚Äúhides‚Äù dirt easier, but it probably also helps that I usually wear them when it starts to get around 0¬∞C and so there isn‚Äôt too much mud &amp; dirt around - it‚Äôs pretty much all frozen when I wear them.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809786542/in/dateposted/" title="DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans Pockets n Stuff"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809786542_6d8a11887e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans Pockets n Stuff" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Because these pants have a membrane on the inside underneath the denim fabric - that membrane has a water resistance rating of 18.150 mm and a Moisture Vapor Transmission Rate (MVTR) rating of 13.000 G/M2/M24hrs - these are WARM üî• pants. It has to be -5¬∞C or more and really windy for me to put on some <a href="https://tidd.ly/3b8r7VS">‚àû long underwear</a> on underneath them, for temperatures above that the pants are warm enough on their own for me. This makes them really great winter pants in my opinion, as this membrane in combination with the DUER L2X Denim is giving me a pair of trousers which keep wind and snow at bay and me toasty and warm, all while looking like a regular pair of jeans. I can not wear these jeans if it‚Äôs above 5¬∞C, as then I simply run to hot, so for me this is a cold weather jeans. However, it is comfortable also when inside - the usual inside temperature in Finland is around 22¬∞C - and if you‚Äôre not exercising on a bike indoors with these jeans on, then you should feel just fine - that‚Äôs where the <em>breathability</em> of the membrane comes in handy.</p>

<p>Alright, they only almost look like a regular pair of jeans, as they have some smart details which make them stand out a wee bit. One detail is the reflective DU/ER logo font on the inside of the trouser legs (it‚Äôs called a cuff, I‚Äôm told =), which makes you more visible in traffic in the dark. This is a wonderful detail and really useful in dark Finland &amp; Scandinavia, and once you‚Äôd arrive at the office, library or Caf√© you could just roll the trouser leg down to hide the reflective detail again. Me, I keep them up, all the time. The pants are a length of 32‚Äù and rolled up it‚Äôs the perfect length for me, and stops just around my ankle.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809669601/in/photostream/" title="Cycling with the DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809669601_896a9fc249_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cycling with the DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There‚Äôs also a reflective logo patch at the waistband, so in case you aren‚Äôt wearing a reflector like every smart non-suicidal person in the North should in winter, you also could be seen via it if you have your jacket that high up. I don‚Äôt but then I have a reflector or two on my jacket. Other features include triple stitched inseams, gussets and back rises, so during all that cycling nothing rips open, double layered back pockets which should be equally durable and long-lasting, and in case you‚Äôre wondering: Yes, this is a five pocket jeans, and I‚Äôm wearing mine in the Slim Cut (there‚Äôs a <a href="https://bit.ly/3q1263g">‚àû Relaxed Jeans</a> available, too).</p>

<p>These are my go-to pants in winter, usually between late September and around late March, when it starts to get warm again. During these six-ish months I happily put on my DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans every day, and go cycling to the grocery store, walking and sledding with the kids, for a walk in the forest or visit a Caf√© in town for a tasty coffee and some Pulla. They have great freedom of movement - they were made as a cycling jeans, after all - and look rather stylish, but the real selling point for me is that these jeans are made to be outside in cold weather, and that they don‚Äôt need to be washed that often. That‚Äôs good for the environment in several ways, and as these pants are made to last, I expect them to keep my toasty for another eight or nine winters!</p>

<p>If you‚Äôd like to grab a pair for yourself - they are available as a Men‚Äôs and <a href="https://bit.ly/3bhwthz">‚àû¬†Women‚Äôs version</a> - order them either directly from <a href="https://bit.ly/3s2D4m2">‚àû DUER</a> if you‚Äôre in North America, in Europe you can get them from <a href="https://tidd.ly/3b7VbRz">‚àû Bergzeit</a> and in Finland from <a href="https://varuste.net/p99564/duer-all-weather-performance-denim-slim-jeans">Varuste</a>.</p>
