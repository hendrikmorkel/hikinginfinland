<p>Last week Friday we drove early in the morning North. North to Rokua. While in Vaasa only the maple trees have started to turn yellow, orange and red, up in Rokua my favourite season was already in full swing, and Birch trees stood in golden Dresses along the trails and lakes. It was beautiful.</p>

<p>We spent the weekend at the <a href="https://www.rokua.com/en">Rokua Health &amp; Spa Hotel</a>, which is located right in the middle of the Rokua GeoPark. From there we were able to go explore the surroundings easily.</p>

<p>We were both hiking and Mountain Biking, as there’s a superb MTB Trail Network in the area. I was lucky enough to have Hannu show me around on Friday afternoon, and M took part in a Mushroom Course on Saturday while I went hiking with the kids.</p>

<p>If we weren’t outside, we enjoyed the modern &amp; clean facilities at the Hotel. The kids loved the amazing Kid’s Playroom and were happy to play there by themselves. Happy kids, happy parents 😊</p>

With the Anfibio REBEL 2K the Packrafting Store has launched a packraft which is ideal for both absolute packrafting beginners and seasoned packrafters, too! It’s versatile in use and it’s compact pack size and light weight make it a dream for remote backpacking - packrafting trips!</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>A ridiculously small pack size and a weight of around 2 kg make the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/Anfibio-packrafts/Anfibio-Rebel-2K::889.html?language=en">Anfibio Rebel 2K</a> an absolute dream to carry on backpacking trips, especially if you go off-trail over the hills. On the water the Rebel 2K shows that it’s not a kids toy: You can run rapids in it, with the optional skeg you paddle large water bodies more efficiently and faster, and the tube bags are amazing to store your gear while paddling, without having a backpack in front of your eyes! <a href="https://youtu.be/Xp3Pkxnl_po">Watch the Video</a> to see it in action:</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>The Rebel 2K arrived in March 2020 with me, and I have used it for paddling on lakes and rivers, paddling in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/bjorko-panike-trail.html">Kvarken Archipelago</a> and I paddled <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/impressions-from-lemmenjoki-and-ivalojoki.html">80 km on the Ivalojoki</a> in Lapland. It has seen a lot of use, and the season isn’t over yet!</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> The Anfibio Rebel 2K you see in this Review and Video is an early version (late 2019), and since then some things have been changed (e.g. the handle on the inside has been removed) and other details further improved.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The idea of a packraft was to allow you to ferry across large rivers and water bodies in remote areas. Nowadays packrafts are a sport on itself, and are used to run difficult, hard white water rapids, in Adventure Races, for fishing and also for trekking and relaxed paddling! Packrafts are inflated with an inflation bag and have one (rarely more) large air chamber. They are light weight - anything from 500 g to 5 kg or more.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50348476217/in/photostream/" title="Anfibio Rebel 2K"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50348476217_f790f2d211_b.jpg" width="1024" height="575" alt="Anfibio Rebel 2K" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>My Anfibio Rebel 2K with the optional tube bags weighs all in 2430 gram. Included in that weight is also the special Anfibio Rebel 2K Comfort Seat, which is 295 g, and the Anfibio DeckPack with 225 g. Not included, but useful to take along on large lake crossings, is the Anfibio Skeg, which is 85 g light. And obviously you also need the inflation bag, which is 108 g. You also need a paddle, PFD and a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/petzl-meteor-helmet-climbing-helmet/?pid=10239">∞ Helmet</a> if you want to paddle rapids.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The features, according to the Packrafting Store:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spacious, 37 cm wide inner with great foot space</li>
  <li>J-shaped Spraydeck which can be rolled to the side, making it an open boat</li>
  <li>Optional TubeBags for transport of your gear inside of the packraft</li>
  <li>Fin Mount for the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Accessories/Anfibio-Skeg::691.html">optional Skeg</a></li>
  <li>Included Comfort Seat</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Designing such a playful, versatile and lightweight yet durable packraft is an innovation, yes. You have to be more careful on low water, but with normal care and the intended use this packraft should last you long!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50352518397/in/dateposted/" title="Salamander"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50352518397_a2a08fe110_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Salamander" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The Packraft is Made in China, and this helps with it’s quality. Not many Western countries have access to the skilled labour force, the materials or tools necessary to produce such high quality packrafts which still do not cost a fortune. I found the quality, looking at the complete package, to be great. As the Packrafting Store gives an extended 3 year Warranty on the Rebel 2K, I imagine they are also convinced that it is a quality product!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50352667302/in/dateposted/" title="Read Carefully"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50352667302_ea11dfc50e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Read Carefully" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>As the packraft is Made in China it means it has to be transported by sea to Europe or elsewhere, and also labour and environmental standards are still lower in China than in Europe. On the other hand, most other packraft manufacturers also use materials which are made in China. I didn’t find a mention about sustainability or similar on the Packrafting Store website, which is something which could be addressed. In use a packraft is a long-lasting item, and always can be repaired, so I am not sure if the topic of recyclability is needed.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <em>I found this <a href="https://www.transa.ch/marken/anfibio/">short information</a> (in German) about the materials, recyclability and fair pay. The Packrafting-Store.de also reached out to inform me that their packrafts, which are Made in China, are transported via a land route to Europe, and not via sea!</em></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I absolutely am in love with the light weight of my Anfibio Rebel 2K packraft setup. Together with the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Paddle/Classic-paddles/Anfibio-Wave::875.html?language=en">920 g light Anfibio Wave paddle</a>, the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Accessories/Anfibio-Buoy-Boy::950.html">Anfibio BuoyBoy Vest</a> and my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/petzl-sirocco-helmet-climbing-helmet/?pid=10239">∞ Petzl Helmet</a> I have a packrafting setup which weighs around 4,5 kg. However, more important for me is the compact pack size which fits easily into or on top of a <a href="https://bit.ly/3l5QkTA">∞ Hyperlite Mountain Gear SouthWest 3400 pack</a> or the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/09/huckepacks-phoenix-lite-review.html">HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite</a>. Having such a compact packraft setup, which also is able to run Class II or more rapids, is immensely useful for me as it allows me to go more off-the-beaten track and run more remote waters.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50137014122/in/album-72157715182503422/" title="Summit Selfie V2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50137014122_2de7abcf10_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit Selfie V2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I found the Rebel 2K to perform well in rapids up to Class II+ with a good amount of water. The raft is agile and it’s easy to get it to go where I want it to go, and it also breaks well through waves. It’s OK in turning into an eddy or easy surfing, and I never capsized in it - it’s a pretty wide boat, and then packrafts generally are difficult to capsize. I haven’t tried doing an Eskimo roll in it, as I don’t have thigh straps, but you could install those for getting even more control over the raft and doing rolls. I used my legs, pushing against the inner tubes, for control, which worked good. I think also beginners will feel confident in this packraft, when running their first white water (as confident one can feel when one is for the first time running white water!)</p>

<p>The Spraydeck is a bit of a weak point for me, though - the Velcro closure will at some point let some water through, and I can’t get the Chimney to close reasonably well around my chest which means it will slide down after a while of paddling. I maybe simply should sew on some shoulder straps to solve this issue 🤔 (<strong>Edit:</strong> <em>The Spraycdeck + Chimney has been improved in current models, and should be better than mine, which is a packraft from the first batch.</em>) I also had some water pool on the Spraydeck after especially big waves, but simply pushing my knees and the Chimney up got the water off the boat. If I don’t need the Spraydeck it’s stowed away in a minute, neatly rolled and strapped to the side, making it an open boat. This is ideal for only crossing water bodies.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50351661298/in/dateposted/" title="Anfibio Rebel 2K Open Spraydeck"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50351661298_2316213035_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Anfibio Rebel 2K Open Spraydeck" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Comfort seat which comes with the raft is good and comfortable, but the strap which you use to connect the seat to the raft ripped out of the seat after a day on the water - that should probably get a better, more durable seam in the future. In use I found this great, as that way I could take the seat easily out to inflate + deflate and use it in camp for sitting. Inflating the seat is hard work - the valve needs strong lungs to inflate, and deflating it is also not my favourite part of a trip, but practice makes perfect. Overall the cockpit of the raft is really generous - 37 cm width on the inside is plenty for me, and I can sit with legs completely stretched out in the boat. There’s a lot of space for my feet and legs, which allows me to move around to switch positions.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50137008647/in/album-72157715182503422/" title="Final Camp"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50137008647_fb866210fe_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Final Camp" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On calm lakes, the sea and slow-flowing rivers the Rebel 2K performed flawlessly, especially with the Fin mounted and the wind in the back. I was able to paddle 4 to 5 km an hour with it under such conditions, but even paddling into 10 m/s wind I paddled 2 km in an hour. I do feel it is best suited for paddling on rivers with a good flow - or then that’s what I prefer, as it’s less work with good speed 🤣</p>

<p>At the start of my Ivalojoki trip I got a <em>tiny</em> puncture into the main tube after I was sliding over gravel in some really low water sections (I should have simply got out and walk it, but I didn’t want to get wet feet 😬) and it drove me insane - I spent two evenings looking for an hour each for the hole, without success. On the third day on the water I by coincidence found it and was able to fix it, which gave me peace of mind. I also would recommend anyone who wants to buy a Rebel 2K to order a set of <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Repairs-stuff/Anfibio-LifePatch::804.html">LifePatches</a> with the raft, as strangely there’s some repair fabrics coming with the raft but nothing to attach them with. That tiny puncture wasn’t bad, I had to inflate the packraft every hour with two, three puffs to get it again fully inflated, but it still was something that made me feel uneasy when running the more demanding rapids - something which I could have avoided completely if I’d remember my Rule #1: <em>“Never slide with your packraft over gravel banks!”</em>. So, learn from my mistakes, and do it better!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50351661393/in/dateposted/" title="Anfibio Rebel 2K Bottom damage"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50351661393_bb41abdf16_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Anfibio Rebel 2K Bottom damage" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Finally, the optional Tube Bags. Well, <em>optional</em> only if you are not going to do long paddling trips with the raft, and as you’re reading this review chances are that is exactly what you have in mind. So take the Rebel 2K <strong>with TubeBags</strong>. It’s so much better than strapping the backpack with all your gear to the front of the boat, it limiting your view on the water and the possibility to transport your bike on it. I love the TubeBags. They are so easy to use, and 70 l of Volume per Tube Bag is ridiculously large. I could fit the complete content of my backpack in there, all the camera gear, and the backpack itself. It’s fantastic. You need to plan what you need throughout the day, as you can not open the TubeBags when the raft is inflated (doing that will break the TubeBags), so pack your stove, coffee and lunch into the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Accessories/Anfibio-DeckPack::808.html">DeckPack</a> and you’re good to paddle the whole day without going hungry or decaffeinated.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>Durability versus lightness, it’s the Battle of Eternity. In one of the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/MRS-packrafts:::43_65.html">MRS Packrafts</a> I can slide over gravel all day long without much of a problem - but then it is almost double as heavy as the Rebel 2K, and also a lot bigger in pack size. And as my packrafting style is more of a <em>“Hiking in the hills and then paddling”</em> the Rebel 2K suits me much better, as it makes the hiking and backpacking part of the trip more enjoyable. Nevertheless, I wish the Rebel 2K could be a tad more durable, while still being just as light. I also would wish for a better Chimney on the spraydeck, or a way that it gets tighter on top and doesn’t slide down so easily. I know that this is a problem which only really slim people like me will have, but this is my review, and I can wish here for things that better suit me 😆</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>If you’re new to the world of packrafting and want the packraft to be an addition to your backpacking trips, or want to be able to paddle easy white water rapids, or cross lakes or the sea, then the Anfibio Rebel 2K is for you. This is one of the most versatile packrafts on the market, which combines a lot of great features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Light weight and compact pack size</li>
  <li>The forgiving and easy handling of the packraft in white water makes it ideal for beginners</li>
  <li>TubeBags are fantastic to transport gear on paddle trips</li>
  <li>With the optional fin you get faster on lakes and paddle more straight &amp; efficiently</li>
  <li>The fantastically low price of 827 €!</li>
  <li>Did I mention the compact size and light weight yet?</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all the Rebel 2K is for me the ultimate adventure packraft – the packraft I take when I will be hiking off-the-beaten track to get to scenic rivers, on which I then can paddle back into civilization. It is light on my backpack and great on the water - exactly what I expect from an adventure packraft!</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/phoenix-lite/">HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite</a> is a 50 l Volume backpack which carries ridiculously comfortable up to 10 kg, and that for a weight of under 300 g. Add in the ZLite backpanel and the Hipbelt Plus and you can carry even more weight, in more comfort. It’s unique Accordion closure makes accessing the content easy without opening the rolltop, and gives this stylish pack a clean, functional look. It is ideal for backpackers who already have a base weight of four to five kilogram and are familiar with the ideas of ultralight backpacking. Watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/3tV8alDSVMo">Video</a> to see the pack in action:</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I received my Phoenix Lite in August 2019, and it has been with me <a href="https://youtu.be/-AYVkZf61UE">backpacking in Hammastunturi Wilderness</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/vPzDSYp71I4">hiking &amp; packrafting the Björkö-Panike Trail</a> and on many shorter trips around Vaasa.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>This <strong>ULTRALIGHT</strong> backpack is made to enable your outdoor adventures without carrying a gram too much. It does carry really damn comfortable, though =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48744082458/in/album-72157710871736122/" title="Hammastunturi Wilderness"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48744082458_873ca178ee_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hammastunturi Wilderness" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>My Phoenix Lite with a Medium back length weighs 296 g including all straps. Together with the optional <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/hipbelt-plus-lite/">Hipbelt Plus Lite</a> (Size S, 57 g/ Pair), one <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/hipbelt-pocket/">Hipbelt Pocket</a> (44 g) and the ZLite back panel (4 Segments, 106 g) it weighs 474 g.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>As the Phoenix Lite is so light, you could imagine it doesn’t have a lot of features. Well, that’s not the case - here is its long list of features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ergonomic S-Shaped Shoulder Straps with Daisy Chains on them</li>
  <li>Adjustable and removable chest strap</li>
  <li>Two really good side pockets</li>
  <li>One large stretchy front pocket</li>
  <li>Side compression straps to minimize the Volume on the Pack</li>
  <li>Inside and Outside attachment possibilities for the included <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/therm-a-rest-z-lite-sleeping-mat/?pid=10239">∞ ZLite Mattress</a>, which functions as back cushioning</li>
  <li>The optional Hipbelt Plus lets you carry up to 12 kg in the pack</li>
  <li>And finally the Extension Collar with the innovative Accordion closure</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>The Accordion closure of the Rolltop closure is a HUCKEPACKS innovation and makes your roll-top backpack look clean, with easier and less noisy access to the inside.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50327293976/in/dateposted/" title="Rolltop Closure, Top View"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50327293976_5e3cd40046_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Rolltop Closure, Top View" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>Hand-made in Germany, from the highest-quality and lightest materials available. The quality is absolutely topnotch, and I expect this pack to last me many years =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50326621248/in/dateposted/" title="Made in Cologne"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50326621248_2055c7ea0a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Made in Cologne" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>HUCKEPACKS produces in a small workshop in Cologne (you can <a href="https://youtu.be/7oWBgnSEBMY">see it in this interview</a>) where the materials are cut and sewn together to create their ultralight packs and accessories. During cutting attention is paid to minimize waste, and also otherwise they try to minimize waste during production. The packs being made from DCFW or DxG I am not certain about what their recyclability is, but the life-cycle of the backpacks is long with normal, good care.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>As always, this is the most important part of the whole article - get a cup of coffee ☕️ or tea 🍵 and then read on.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/jw76p2" title="Breaking Camp"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50327526877_bb4e5ea3f8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Breaking Camp" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite is the lighter brother of the <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/phoenix/">Phoenix DxG</a>, and the Lite is made from black Dyneema Composite Fabric Woven (what we called cuben back in the day) in different strengths. The material is waterproof, the pack isn’t however - because the seams aren’t taped. In reality I haven’t had any rain/ water get into the pack, and the material is durable and has survived bushwhacking and heavier loads without problem thus far.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50327464042/in/dateposted/" title="HUCKEPACKS"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50327464042_756c9af547_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="HUCKEPACKS" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>COM. FORT. ABLE.</strong> I really love how comfortable this pack carries. The four segments of the ZLite, which function as the backpanel on the ergonomically designed back of the pack, are really pleasant on my back. And if you’re not a fan of it you also could use a different mattress or none at all, if you for example use the Burrito Frame packing method. I do get a sweaty back, but I do get that pretty much with every backpack I use. With food for 5 days, a tripod and camera gear the pack was really comfortable to carry all day long.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50327462992/in/photostream/" title="Shoulder Strap &amp; Back Pad 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50327462992_e7e4e47633_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Shoulder Strap &amp; Back Pad 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I always have loved the shoulder straps Mateusz has on his backpacks, and these are no different. They are really well designed and with a good, ergonomic fit that carries also heavier loads in comfort, and most importantly: I can attach my <a href="https://bit.ly/3bKwoRH">∞ Peak Design Capture V3 Clip</a> on them, for easy access to my camera. The shoulder straps are made from a 3D Mesh and Copolymer foam, in different thicknesses which makes them soft &amp; flexible and they adapt well to you body, while at the same time transferring the weight really well, ensuring a comfortable carry.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50326626583/in/dateposted/" title="HUCKEPACKS Ergonomic S-Shaped Shoulder Straps"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50326626583_0190934d17_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="HUCKEPACKS Ergonomic S-Shaped Shoulder Straps" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Side pockets are spacious, and I can grab my water bottle while hiking, which I really appreciate, and there’s also space for more stuff, like my tripod, a Kuksa and my chili nuts. The front mesh pocket is big enough to fit in a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/09/hyperlite-mountain-gear-dirigo-2.html">large shelter</a> or my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/200-g-hardshell-montane-podium-pull-on-and-pants.html">rain gear</a> in there without problems.</p>

<p>The Hipbelt Plus Lite which I have with the pack suits my style better - I’m not a fan of the simple 20 mm hipbelt strap it comes with, and feel the Hipbelt Plus Lite is a good alternative for me. It wraps around my narrow hips nicely, and transfers the weight really well. Also long days with 10 to 12 kg are not problem, which is often the weight I carry at the start of a trip with all my camera gear, food and water.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50326623528/in/dateposted/" title="HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite Hipbelt Plus"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50326623528_fb3a9a2d9d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite Hipbelt Plus" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then finally, the collar and Accordion closure of the Phoenix Lite. Some of you might remember the original <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/first-look-laufbursche-huckepack.html">Laufbursche Huckepacks backpack</a>, which already had a very innovative closure that ensured that no water can get inside the pack. With the Phoenix Mateus went for a classic Toploader design with a rolltop closure – but the rolltop closure has a twist - actually, more a fold =) The Accordion closure gives this pack a really clean appearance as it folds the material, which in other backpacks comes out at the sides, to the inside. I imagine this adds to the durability of the pack, but it definitely makes it easier to get things from the inside, as you don’t even have to open the small hook as you can grab past it inside. No noisy Velcro which keeps it together, but a clean, minimalistic and durable way to close the top. I love it.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>From a design perspective I understand why the Phoenix Lite’s main body is 40 l Volume and not more, but I have on the start of my trips often found that I’d wish the pack had 5 or 10 l more Volume. The simple reason is that in addition to the backpacking kit and food I also carry camera gear which can range in Volume anywhere between one and ten litres. Especially at the start of a trip, when there’s food for seven days along, it’s for me really hard to figure out how I get my camera stuff inside. This is a problem which likely not many will have, but I wish that somehow the pack would have a wee bit more Volume so I could fit my camera gear easier inside (I solve this problem usually by having the camera stuff in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/05/huckepacks-beipack.html">beiPACK</a>!).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50327283211/in/photostream/" title="Tripod on the right, beiPACK, Camera Gear and Phoenix Lite"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50327283211_08a9d35cf3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tripod on the right, beiPACK, Camera Gear and Phoenix Lite" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I also would like to lose the grommet in the bottom. I haven’t had any water come inside through it, but similarly I never had to drain the inside of my pack. But I see as a possibility for moisture/ water to get inside the pack when I set it down where it is wet.</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like the side compression go the complete length of the pack. Now it only compress the upper 2/3 of the pack, and not the bottom, and I’d wish that the side compression straps would be more like on the <a href="https://ula-equipment.9xrw.net/P3qZN">∞ ULA Ohm</a>, which has from all the backpacks I have used in the past 20+ years the best side compression system.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I love how clean the pack looks when packed - there’s nothing superfluous on there, just a functional, beautiful pack which carries extremely well. And while I find it sometimes hard to fit everything I need to have along on a trip (as you can see above) it is a spacious pack for week-long trips. One thing I really appreciate and like is that a full pack doesn’t ride above my shoulders. Usually the pack stops on the same line as my shoulders, which is from an ergonomics point-of-view for me really good. It also gives usually the impression that one is on a day trip, as the pack is so small 😆 All in all this is my go-to pack when I’m heading outdoors, and I’m looking forward to many more great trips with this durable, beautiful, comfortable and well-designed pack. Also, make sure to see my detailed <a href="https://youtu.be/3tV8alDSVMo">HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite Review Video</a> to see what I carry in the pack and all the details in action!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>#NukuYöUlkona</strong> is an event from Suomen Latu, which inspires people in Finland (and elsewhere =) to sleep a night outside! This year I took the kids and our new family tent along, and we spent a beautiful afternoon, night and morning outside in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Kvarken Archipelago!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50289199008/in/dateposted/" title="Långgrund"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50289199008_eaf9ec5722_b.jpg" width="1024" height="575" alt="Långgrund" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Packing for three is 3 times as complicated as packing for one - but as long as three spoons, three Kuksas and one stove, as well as Marshmallows, are along, nothing can go wrong! Seriously though, I had to make a list to make sure we had everything along on our hiking and camping trip for the #NukuYöUlkona Challenge. I also made them carry some gear - the older one a bit more, but even the small one carried 2 l of fresh water, her book and sleeping buddy for the whole 3,5 km without complaints!</p>

<p>I decided to take my small kids to Kvarken, and camp with them at Långgrundet, which is the fire and campsite I explored earlier in the year when I was <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/bjorko-panike-trail.html">packrafting here</a>. The trip had everything to go well: A great weather forecast with not too fresh temperatures during the night, clear skies to see the stars (and some faint Northern Lights!), a really nice trail, a lot less bugs than a few weeks ago still, and tasty berries along a nice trail. My wife dropped us off at Svedjehamn and then the three of us set out on the trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50290025252/in/dateposted/" title="Foresty trails"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50290025252_3e70c3d6a6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Foresty trails" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Along the trail we tasted lingonberries and Seabuckthorn berries, which grow a lot here in the Archipelago. They are a bit sour, but super healthy, and I find them really tasty. The kids got in the middle some Marshmallows as a motivation to keep going, but thanks to our regular Sunday hikes they are happy and able to walk longer distances - and so this 3,5 km trip was done after just an hour of hiking. As we arrived at Långgrundet we went to look together for the best spot for our <a href="https://tidd.ly/34LniCV">∞ new family tent</a>, and together picked a really good spot. I told the kids what’s most important, and they did a great job with pitching the tent and checking if it’s a flat spot =)</p>

<p>The next thing was what the kids waited for the most: Dinner! While I myself have a vegan diet since two years now, the kids like to eat some meat now &amp; then, and they wished to take some Bratwurst with us so we could grill them over the fire! They loved the grilled sausages which they ate around the fire hungrily, while I prepared two <a href="https://tidd.ly/2X2n0CX">∞ LYO Food meals</a> for us. We took them and our three long-handled Titanium spoons to the jetty, where we sat down in the setting sun and enjoyed our second dinner above the water. And because I wanted to make sure that they’re warm at night, we topped things off with a hot chocolate with more Marshmallows after that! Their bellies full they definitely were happy, and after brushing their teeth (they were not a fan of my <a href="https://amzn.to/3fd2AgD">∞ DentTabs</a>😁) the two of them retired to the tent and were reading with their headlamps on.</p>

<p>Once they put their lights off I went to take some photos.</p>

<p>I stayed up till a wee bit past midnight, as there was a good chance to see the Northern Lights that night, but ultimately was pretty tired and so also went to brush my teeth, topped off my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/therm-a-rest-neoair-uberlight-sleeping-mat/?pid=10239">∞ Uberlite</a> with one more puff and then snuggled up in my <a href="https://katabaticgear.com/shop/chisos-sleeping-bag/">Katabatic Gear Chisos</a> quilt. The kids were already peacefully sleeping under their own quilts (one <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/as-tucas-sestrals-quilt.html">As Tucas Sestrals Quilt</a> and one <a href="https://www.vaude.com/en-INT/Equipment/Sleeping-Bags-Mats/Sleeping-Bags/4792/Alpstein-450-DWN">Vaude Alpstein 450 quilt</a>), and soon I too was sleeping - though there were a lot of Whopper Swans making noise around us, and also some sheep with bells were walking around.</p>

<p>The next morning the oldest one was up at 8 am, and together we got silently out of the tent while the little one continued to sleep in the middle. I started to prepare breakfast for us - instant chocolate porridge with strawberries and raspberries - and then picked the little one up when she woke up. Together we sat at one of the benches, eating all our porridge, enjoying the warm, sunny weather on this Sunday morning.</p>

<p>And then it was time to start to pack already and head back to Svedjehamn. I asked the kids if they’d like to pick some Seabuckthorn berries for us, which we could make into a cake at home, and much to my surprise they were up for it (they did get several Marshmallows as a reward, too 😃)! This was perfect, because while they were picking berries I was able to pack everything into our three backpacks - of which I had the biggest one, a <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=47cd1998-e608-4548-aa0f-3d33e964ad3a&amp;website_id=a037a589-aec6-4e81-920c-77b10ab91eff&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fhyperlitemountaingear.com%2Fcollections%2Fpacks%2Fproducts%2F3400-southwest">∞ Hyperlite Mountain gear SouthWest 3400</a>!</p>

<p>Soon after, we shouldered our much lighter packs, and started the enjoyable hike back.</p>

<p>An hour later our little adventure came to an end. Again we picked tasty lingonberries and Seabuckthorn berries along the way, passed the birdwatching tower and the picturesque red boat sheds, and gave mom a big hug when we met her at Svedjehamn!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50290022317/in/dateposted/" title="Autumn colours"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50290022317_9045479cd0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Autumn colours" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>It was a great little trip with my kids. They also enjoyed it a lot, and are already asking when we will go the next time! With autumn at our doorstep the best time to go hiking and backpacking just started, so I hope we get to explore some trails around Vaasa and camp out together soon again!</p>

<p>You know what is the problem with Lapland? It’s so darn far away from Vaasa. To be precise, it’s a 4 hour train ride and an additional 12 hour car ride far away. That’s a lot of sitting on your buttocks, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oolaw/">Olli</a> and me were mighty happy to roll on the very full parking lot of Lemmenjoki at 23:00 o’clock on a Sunday night in July. Now Lemmenjoki is Finland’s largest National Park, with an area of 2860 km², but also pretty inaccessible if you don’t have a car - as there’s not really any public transportation going to the Park - <em>and</em> it is also a bit <em>“off-the-beaten-track”</em> so we were pretty surprised to find a full parking lot. But then it was July, the month where Finns traditionally take holidays, and there’s also this <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/04/planning-your-first-hike.html">Pandemic</a> going on so maybe it was obvious that Finns will flock to their National Parks?</p>

<p>Anyway, after roughly 16 hours of sitting I put on my new <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/inov-8-mudclaw-g-260-trail-running-shoes/?pid=10239">∞ inov-8 Mudclaw G 260 shoes</a>, shouldered my heavy <a href="https://bit.ly/3l5QkTA">∞ Southwest pack</a> with food for nine days and all the packrafting gear, and then Olli and me hiked to the Muurhaislampi camp spot some 900 m away. The sun was still shining, there were a few Mosquitos accompanying us, and at the camp spot we also met some other hikers who were still up and pitching their shelters. Olli and me had an (non-alcoholic) beer to celebrate our arrival, and then it was off to sleep.</p>

<p>Well, I at least tried to sleep. A lonely Reindeer with a bell around its neck kept walking around the camp ground and the lake, the <em>“ding-dong, ding-dong”</em> of the bell keeping me well awake. I was up early thus, made my breakfast porridge and coffee and waited for Olli to appear. He’d accompany me for a few kilometres to the summit of Joenkielinen, before he would continue to Kevo Nature Reserve. A bit after 9:00 I started to hike, just to meet Olli an hour later at the Sotkajärvi Laavu, where he had breakfast and I another coffee (Olli isn’t one for a breakfast right after getting up!). The temperature was already warm - maybe around 21°C - by the time we started the climb up the fjell. I decided to leave my heavy pack down by the trail, and hid it a bit. Happily Finland is still a safe country where this is possible to do - I really enjoyed hiking up the mountain with nothing but my camera in hand and the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/05/huckepacks-beipack.html">HUCKEPACKS beiPACK</a> around my shoulder.</p>

<p>We summited 45 minutes later, a great speed for the 3 km and around 300 m of ascent, especially since it got warmer, and warmer. Up on the summit of Joenkielinen a stiff breeze was blowing which helped us cool down. Taking in the magnificent views we did: You could see till Norway in the North-West, the Muotkatunturi Wilderness Area in the North-East, and Hammastunturi in the East. Gentle, rolling hills in every direction, in between there were silver slices of water bodies on which the sun reflected, and of course forests 🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲. It was a great summit to view the surroundings, and a day later I’d be standing alone on an even higher summit. Olli and me said good-bye - we’d meet again at the weekend - and while he ran back to the Parking lot I hiked down to my backpack - which was still there!</p>

<p>The trail continued as before, on a beautiful esker ridge which became a forest. I reached Searitniva after a while, and used the boat ferry to get to the other side of the Lemmenjoki river. There was a canoe and a row boat on the shore, and several people sitting around the ring of fire. I checked out the day trip hut, and then took my shoes off and ate some of my chilli nuts in the sun. I tried to slow down, not hurry to much, but didn’t enjoy the loud talking from the other people, so soon shouldered my <a href="https://bit.ly/3l5QkTA">∞ SouthWest backpack</a> again and continued. The 5 km to Härkäkoski were not fun: Too much mosquitos and horseflies where buzzing around me, and while they couldn’t get me because of the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/sea-to-summit-nano-mosquito-headnet-mosquito-net/?pid=10239">∞ Sea to Summit Nano Mosquito Headnet</a> I was wearing, their buzzing sound wasn’t pleasant, and neither was the by now really hot weather. I also didn’t have a coffee and the lack of caffeine did the rest.</p>

<p>I arrived at Härkäkoski, where there’s a rental hut, a campground and another boat ferry. I filled up my BeFree water bottle, took the stove out and made myself a coffee, which made me feel a lot better. The next two kilometres to the Ravadasjärvi Hut felt amazing again, with a pretty trail, a lot less insects bothering me, and it also was less warm. I soon arrived at the Ravadasjärvi Hut, and it was 17 o’clock. A good time to stop hiking, but then I did want to go to Kultahamina.</p>

<p>I chilled in the sun, let my feet cool down in the water of the Lemmenjoki river, and then asked a dad with his two sons who were making dinner if they’d been to Kultahamina and if it is as pretty as here at Ravadasjärvi. <em>“Nope”</em> he said, this spot would be a lot nicer. I answered some of his questions, and then decided to call it a day and put my gear into one of the two open shelters and stay here. I did hike some 23 km after all, and this was a beautiful evening with the sun shining. I rolled out my quilt and mattress in the hut, and then went to sit outside to make dinner and a cup of tea. I got to chat with Maria, who was hiking on her own with her dog.</p>

<p>Later that evening Maria, her dog and me hiked to the Ravadaköngäs waterfalls, which were pretty in the evening light, and it also made for a good evening stroll. By 21 o’clock I was under my quilt in the bivy, the couple of mosquitos who found a way inside the hut trying to get to me, but without any success thanks to the mesh net. I slept a solid 10 hours till 7:00 the next morning, including a wee stroll in the middle of the night to photograph the sunrise which bathed Morgam-Viipus fjell in a beautiful light pink-orange glow.</p>

<p>I was the first one up that morning, and silently enjoyed my breakfast. I had a long day ahead of me - because I didn’t camp at Kultahamina an additional 7 km were on top of my guesstimated 25 km route for the day, so you won’t be surprised to read that I was on the trail before 9:00 o’clock. I passed Ravadaköngäs again, this time the sun shining on the waterfall, and I enjoyed seeing it in this light again. The trail to Kultahamina was gorgeous, and I enjoyed this section immensely. Beautiful soft forest trails, passing some tiny streams which provided me with fresh, cold water on this already warm day, were very welcome. The Morgamnive campsite, down by the Lemmenjoki river, looked really inviting and even better than where I slept the previous night, but this are things you can not know before.</p>

<p>I arrived at Kultahamina around 11:00 and was put off by the 15+ Quads with trailers which stood under tarps close to the jetty and the open wilderness hut. Up till the 1st of July it was legal to search for gold in the National Park with “engine-powered machine” but now you’re only allowed to use a spade and a gold wash pan. I had a look around Kultahamina and had a small porridge break at the campfire place. A bunch of people started to hike past me, and I saw that one of the boats had arrived at the jetty. There’s a useful motor boat shuttle service running from Njurkulahti to Ravadasköngäs and Kultahamina twice a day, and many people use this possibility to either go up or down the river - it’s around 20 km of hiking you skip that way.</p>

<p>I finished my porridge and coffee and started the next leg of my hike. My map suggested there’d be an old trail crossing the river over to the other side, but shortly after exploring it the result was that my brand-new <a href="https://tidd.ly/3kXJP4R">∞ inov-8 Mudclaw G 260</a> were no longer bright green, but muddy brown - and I still wasn’t on the other side, but now also had wet shoes and socks. Yay! So back to the jetty I went, inflated my <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/Anfibio-packrafts/Anfibio-Rebel-2K::889.html?language=en">packraft</a> and paddled in 3 minutes over to the other side.</p>

<p>Once I had the packraft stored away again, the hardest stretch of the whole trip started: Hiking up to the summit of Morgam-Viipus. Roughly 400 m of ascent over 2 km, it was steep - add in a temperature of 22°C degree and my Army of Mosquitos and Black-flies which accompanied me, and you can picture how happy I was when I left the forest behind me and was above the treeline, where a nice breeze blew at least the annoying mosquitos away! During that strenuous hike I also was pondering the question if mosquitos and black flies have a territory which they inhabit and which they do not leave, or if they are nomads and would accompany me till Sallivaara or Ivalo 🤔</p>

<p>At the summit I had another coffee and chilled in the sun. It was a pretty day, and a large stone circle kept the wind at bay. The views towards the West were superb, as was my planned route towards the South and Sallivaara - it looked like a long day was still ahead of me… I walked on the soft, mossy ground to Viibosoaivi, and then passed a beautiful camping spot by the two lakes between the summit of Viibosoaivi and Sállejohoaivi. Tadpoles were swimming between the stones at the shore, there was little wind, plenty of flat spots for my TrailStar and bivy, and there were no mosquitos! I really should have just camped there - something which I can write now in hindsight, and which you should do when you’re going backpacking in Lemmenjoki!</p>

<p>I continued to the summit of Sállejohoaivi, and had dinner with a view. It was 17 o’clock, I was hungry, and I knew I wouldn’t be any time soon at Sallivaara, so I might as well make my pack a bit lighter and eat up here. I had a tasty REAL Turmat Vegan meal, a cup of tea and a smile on my face about the beauty which surrounded me. The sun ☀️ still stood high in the sky and it was warm, something which I welcomed as it meant I could hike in my T-Shirt here above the treeline.</p>

<p>My planned route now took me down via some boulder fields, and then I crossed a reindeer fence and a small stream before climbing a boulder field back up towards Jänisvaarat. When I arrived there, past 19 o’clock, I realized I had to abandon my original plan of hiking all the summits on my route towards Sallivaara. I had wanted to summit Iso Jänispää, Pikku Jänispää, Jänispäät and Jänispään Etelälaki on my route towards my goal for the day, but it was late, I was getting tired after already over 20 km of hiking and I wanted to arrive not too late. So I switched to the Altimeter view on my <a href="https://www.suunto.com/fi-fi/Tuotteet/Urheilulaitteet-ulkoiluun/Suunto-Spartan-Ultra/Suunto-Spartan-Ultra-All-Black-Titanium/">Suunto Spartan Ultra</a> which helped me to stay on the same altitude - which meant I saved energy - while I skirted the Jänispää summits.</p>

<p>It was late - probably around 21:30 o’clock - when I stood on the summit of Jänispään Etelälaki. It felt the day went on forever by now, and I still had 5 km to go till Sallivaara. There were a few swamps which I had to cross, and as I now dropped down between the trees also my mosquitos friends were back around me, accompanying me on this final stretch. The hiking went through dense birch trees to swamps full of Labrador Tea to sparse pine forests, and of course shortly before reaching Sallivaara I had to cross a swamp and got wet feet. This seems to be Murphy’s Law for me - dry feet most of the day, but shortly before camp… they get wet. And muddy. Yay.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock I walk inside of one of the huts at Sallivaara. There’s plenty of open huts here, but I need a moment to find the Open Wilderness Hut which is for us backpackers and hikers. I hang my sweaty clothes up, light a wee fire - more to get rid of the mosquitos and dry my clothes than to make it warm inside. The thermometer outside says it’s still 18°C, and I grab my two water bottles and walk to the spring. I have to cross the whole area to get to the small water spring, and am upset that I didn’t take my camera with me. It’s the Golden Hour, and the Reindeer Herding site, the huts and especially the absolutely gorgeous swamp are bathed in a golden light, and it all looks fantastic. Just the mosquitos… probably feel this walking buffet is for them. My hands are the only exposed skin, but it’s insane how many mosquitos land on them and get smacked to death in seconds. I must have killed three dozen mosquitos just while filling the water bottles at the spring, and then make a small run to leave most of them behind. Back at my hut I am just tired. It were 33 km, 26 km off-trail over the fjells, and so I slip into my bivy, happy that the mosquitos again can not get to me, and soon fall asleep.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning I get up late - it’s 9:00 o’clock when I crawl out of my quilt. Minutes later the <a href="https://tidd.ly/34fQqle">∞ Windboiler</a> is emitting steam, and I pour the boiling water in my large Kupilka Kuksa for my coffee. After the coffee I make a LYO Food coconut porridge, and start packing up. But before hiking to the Repovesi bridge and starting the packrafting trip of the part, I want to explore Sallivaara. My first stop is the information hut, which has information booklets in four or five languages about this site. The stories are beautiful, and tell so much of how infrastructure developments up here in Lapland can significantly impact the lives of the local Sámi people. Also the stories about the wolves, which have killed reindeer - but never a human - are things I wish more people would know.</p>

<p>Next I hike up the hill. I felt like this wouldn’t be necessary as I was on much higher hills the previous day, and didn’t think that this wee summit has anything of interest to show. How wrong I was! I could see the magnificent swamp I saw the previous evening, many pretty forest islands in the swamp, lots of fine summits - and also the bridge I’d be hiking to! A bird of prey was calling, and some rain started to come down - just to stop a few minutes later. The views from the hill were great thus, and I was happy that I walked up. Back at the hut - it’s about one kilometre to the huts and the round-up fence - I shouldered my pack for the final 7 km of this trip.</p>

<p>These 7 km went through plenty of swamps, and all the mosquitos tried again and again and again to get a drop of blood from my hands. While the scenery was superb - I love hiking through swamps - the mosquitos and black flies, together with the warm weather, were really going on my nerves. It felt that if a breeze blew away a bunch of mosquitos while out in the open, 10 seconds later a new swarm was ready to annoy &amp; attack me. I was so happy when I reached the road - where still dozens of mosquitos were around - and had my packraft inflated &amp; packed, ready for the next leg of the trip.</p>

<p><strong>Lemmenjoki National Park</strong> was amazing. I loved hiking on the Gold Trail, checking out the great huts and campsites along the way, and am a bit sad that I didn’t explore the North-Western part more, and also didn’t have time to go further south and check out some of the Fire Watch-out Towers. There’s quite a few open Wilderness Huts in the park, but besides the Gold Trail not really any trails - which makes it ideal for off-trail adventures. Hiking above the treeline is easy and rewarding with great views and no mosquitos, and down by the Lemmenjoki river you can see &amp; learn about the gold rush history of the area.</p>

<p>The biggest down-side to Lemmenjoki is getting there. You can get with public transportation (for example via <a href="https://www.vr.fi/cs/vr/fi/etusivu">night train</a> till Rovaniemi + <a href="https://www.matkahuolto.fi">bus</a>) till Ivalo, but then you’ll need to invest around 90€ for the Taxi-ride to Njurkulahti - one-way. You always can try to split the costs for the Taxi ride with other hikers you might meet on the bus to Ivalo, or try to hitch a ride - here up North it can be really easy to get taken along. I was lucky that I was able to share a ride with Olli and that he dropped me off at the trailhead, but also that was a 12 hour ride from Jyväskylä (including some breaks!).</p>

<p>On the trail I encountered dozens of people, which surprised me as I didn’t expect so many people to come this far off-the-beaten track. But it seems there were many day hikers who used the motor boat shuttle up or down the river, so after the last pick-up around 19 or 20 o’clock in the evening only the backpackers are left, and they were few. I imagine in the off-season (beautiful autumn, starting soon!) you will encounter few people on the trail, and again no one off it. Make sure to have your navigation skills up-to-date, a map, compass and your favourite <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/383480947">∞ navigation app</a> along for off-trail adventures, and then get ready to explore Finland’s largest National Park!</p>

These are Unisex rain garments made for trailrunning, but with a light or <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/under-2-kg-baseweight-sul-summer-backpacking.html">SUL backpack</a> on your shoulders they also work really well. Just don’t use it if you carry a 15 kg or more heavy pack!</p>

<p>If you squeeze them together in the included stuff sack then the pull-on in Size S weighs 103 g, and the pants is even under 100 g at a mere 98 g. The rain gear I have worn (and still wear on longer trips where more rain is expected) is closer to 1 kg in weight together, so this is a major update &amp; weight saving for summer trips where I can get away with such light kit.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49956161841/in/dateposted/" title="Öjenskogen Impressions"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49956161841_6fc623970f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Öjenskogen Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I also used the pants and Pull-on on my recent <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/impressions-from-lemmenjoki-and-ivalojoki.html">packrafting trip in Lapland</a> as a waterproof jacket + pants while paddling (as I don’t yet own an <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Kleidung/Anfibio-ZipSuit::703.html">ultralight drysuit</a>!), where they did a great job. On the first day I forgot to switch jackets and the sleeves of my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody</a> got really (soaking) wet, a problem I didn’t have at all with the Montane Podium Pull-on. So it’s also multi-use, which is great!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50136774041/in/dateposted/" title="Psyched after running the &quot;hardest&quot; rapid on the trip"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50136774041_89a6246871_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Psyched after running the &quot;hardest&quot; rapid on the trip" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>It obviously also works well as a rainwear kit when <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning</a>, the small pack size means it fits in your trailrunning pack without problems. So if you practice trailrunning at home to keep fit and want something to take along on long runs to keep dry in the rain, this will suit just fine!</p>

<p>The only downside I found with both the pants and Pull-on are that I run really hot under them. Now both garments are made from Montane’s <em>Aqua Pro Lite</em> fabric which has a breathability rating of 15.000 g/ m2/ 24 h MVTR but in practice I found that it can get sweaty and warm underneath them if you throw them over your normal (hiking) garments. My solutions to this (and as a Disclosure, I do run hot easily!) is to only wear boxer shorts and a T-Shirt underneath them and have the zipper on the Pull-On open as much as possible. That keeps the temperature underneath at a bearable level, especially since I used these in summer temperatures where it was between 15°C and 30°C air temperature. Maybe in spring and autumn when it is cooler and less humid, that it will be less warm under it.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s not the most durable piece of kit, so do not wear this if you have to bushwhack or carry a heavy 20 kg backpack. The intended purpose is firmly for trailrunning, Ultra runs and not for backpacking - though it is completely fine to use it with an ultralight backpack in my experience. The material is really thin, and very stretchy, and hasn’t suffered on my trips in the past four months, but then it also hasn’t rained that much here and hence I haven’t worn it so often.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50194571363/in/dateposted/" title="Montane Podium Pants &amp; Pull-on"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50194571363_18edc0e8e5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Montane Podium Pants &amp; Pull-on" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, if these looks like something for you and you also want to carry a real UL rain jacket and pack in your pack, which does a good job of keeping you dry in the rain, then you can pick up the <a href="https://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/mens-clothing-c1/mens-waterproof-shell-c51/waterproof-smocks-c202/podium-unisex-waterproof-pull-on-p13318">Montane Podium Pull-on</a> at <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/04/one-stop-shop-ultralight-outdoor-gear.html">Ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk</a>, at <a href="https://amzn.to/31sGVvY">∞ Amazon.co.uk</a>, where you also can get the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Pv3wTb">∞ Montane Podium pants</a>. Currently both together cost around 178 €, which is less than their combined weight 😁</p>

<h2 id="awesome-maps">Awesome Maps!</h2>

<p>I have written about maps before (a loooong time ago <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/06/waterproof-hiking-maps.html">here</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/04/planning-a-trip-in-the-lake-district.html">here</a>). I ❤️ Maps. I love looking at them, planning hikes with them, love reliving past trips with them, just folding them back into the original way, that I don’t love that much (I’m not so good at that). A map you don’t need to fold at all are the maps from <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">∞ Awesome Maps</a> as you should frame them and hang them from your wall to look at. Like my <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/collections/canvas-world-maps/products/mountain-bike-mtb-trails-map-canvas?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">∞ Mountain biking World Map</a>, which I put up in my man cave. I started to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/active-holidays-in-are-sweden.html">Downhill MTB in Åre</a> a few years ago and absolutely love the sport, and I found this Awesome Map the prettiest - I love the style, colours and graphics.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49742174521/in/dateposted/" title="Awesome Mountainbiking Maps!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49742174521_25a275edc3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Awesome Mountainbiking Maps!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49741625368/in/dateposted/" title="Awesome Maps, North and Central America"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49741625368_abdebd9648_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Awesome Maps, North and Central America" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49741624818/in/dateposted/" title="Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49741624818_9fa621a91c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But Awesome Maps not only makes this Map - they make (in Germany!) <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/pages/our-maps?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">∞ a dozen of inspiring outdoor maps</a>. And you don’t need to get them as a Canvas map either (though I highly recommend them!), the paper maps are just as pretty, more affordable and can also be easily hanged from the wall - either with the <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/products/wooden-oak-poster-hangers?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">∞ handmade Oak hanging frame</a>, some Blue Tac or you get it framed at your local framing business! The paper maps are made from the good stuff, too: 250 gsm art paper which is acid free and silk coated, and you even can write on them with an whiteboard marker! That’s perfect if you wanna put a check ✅ behind e.g. the trails you have hiked already!</p>

<h2 id="diy-frame-for-the-canvas-map">DIY Frame for the Canvas Map</h2>

<p>So that’s the canvas map Awesome Maps sent me, together with the <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/products/custom-made-diy-canvas-wood-frame-kit?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">∞ DIY Wood Canvas Frame</a>. I wanted the canvas map as it is larger and fits better into my man cave, and I also can hang it easily from the shelves in my man cave, as you hopefully agree 😊 And even if you don’t agree, hanging the canvas map from the shelves means I can hide the things behind it easily!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49742175336/in/dateposted/" title="Assembled the frame myself, which was a nice DIY Project"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49742175336_671f6a922f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Assembled the frame myself, which was a nice DIY Project" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Assembling the DIY Frame was easy: All I needed was a hammer and a canvas stapler, both tools which I owned already. It was a easy 20 minutes task to assemble the frame and staple the canvas to it, and then it was just a question to bring the large map from the living room to the cellar!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49742175451/in/dateposted/" title="Finished Awesome Map!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49742175451_b5b65ccd42_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Finished Awesome Map!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There I used two hooks from my IKEA shelf to hang the map, and <em>Voilá!</em> I have an awesome map to look at when I’m painting or packing or planning in my man cave!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49741624443/in/dateposted/" title="Awesome Maps made my Man Cave prettier!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49741624443_b3b9ca2e90_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Awesome Maps made my Man Cave prettier!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="why-super-ultralight">WHY Super Ultralight?</h2>

<p>That questions is probably on a lot of readers minds. While I see more &amp; more lightweight backpacks and shelters when I am out <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/destinations/">backpacking in Finland</a>, there are still lots more people backpacking with heavy 80 l Volume backpacks, hiking on established trails &amp; sleeping in our Open Wilderness Huts. Which begs my question: Why so heavy? As you will see in this article, I own &amp; use UL gear since 10+ years, and yet things have to go broken. Which means ultralight equipment - backpacks, sleeping pads, shelters &amp; tents as well as garments, shoes and quilts - is durable and long-lasting, without being overbuilt.</p>

<p>While my base weight is usually somewhere around 3 to 5 kg, in the summer I do SUL trips as it’s very enjoyable to not carry the heavy camera and tripod, to leave the large backpack at home and simply to enjoy the small pack which carries everything I need for hiking on a trail on a warm summer day. People have a hard time believing that you can fit everything into a 24 l backpack, but hey - equipment materials have become lighter and can be compressed a lot more nowadays, so it’s pretty easy, as you can see in the accompanying video underneath. So for me going SUL in the summer is about enjoyment, being more connected to nature and the surrounding environment, while being able to cover longer distances without pain &amp; stress. It simply is fun to be out with a light pack, without sacrificing any comfort or safety. And yes, there’s also some gear-nerdery going on on such trips, and testing what is possible! <strong>You can view the complete list at the end of the article or <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/z1a081">here</a>.</strong></p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sYMGl8INJMo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h2 id="carrying">Carrying</h2>

<p>Going SUL starts with the backpack for me. I want a comfortable, durable, and obviously really light backpack for short SUL Trips. HUCKEPACKS sent me their amazing <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/specials/packl-special/">PACKL Special</a> in Orange VX07 fabric, and I have been using this pack on short trips and day hikes since the spring. Now at 284 g and an extra 34 g for the foam CCF pad on the inside experienced hikers immediately will say <em>“There are lighter options!”</em> and they are right. For example the <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/packl-lite/">PACKL Lite</a>, also from HUCKEPACKS, is only 146 g <em>“heavy”</em> - that’s a whooping 138 g less, which in SUL Terms is A LOT. But I have the PACKL Special, and as my other equipment is really light, I can take this <em>slightly heavier</em> backpack 😃 And with it’s three extra pockets for organizing and the two mesh pockets for water bottles, this pack keeps my stuff organized and easy to access. It’s also really pretty, and easy to see which is good if you’re hunting in areas where there’s hunting going on. But yeah, I’m tempted to maybe pick up the PACKL Lite next summer, to go even a bit more light…</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49955656098/in/dateposted/" title="Öjenskogen Impressions"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49955656098_f20a8457a7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Öjenskogen Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sleeping">Sleeping</h2>

<p>MY SUL Sleep System is a combination of old and new gear. It is for me really amazing to see how some equipment has gotten progressively lighter over the last ten years, while other gear already was really light. The foundation of my comfortable &amp; warm sleep system is the <a href="https://tidd.ly/3jQB0JF">∞ Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Uberlite</a> (<a href="https://youtu.be/5oXFCJi0TII">Here’s my Review</a>), an amazingly warm &amp; comfortable inflatable sleeping pad which weighs a mere 232 g in the Regular length. That is 120 g lighter than my previous summer UL mattress, the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite.html">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Xlite</a> (which I still own and use regularly). A CCF pad or two could lighter, but honestly - this mattress is so compact in pack size, is so warm, comfortable and easy to use, that I don’t see a reason to use any other mattress.</p>

<p>My Medium-Length and Standard Width <a href="https://zpacks.com/products/30f-classic-sleeping-bag">ZPACKS Classic Sleeping Bag</a> is 340 g light, and this quilt is 10-ish years old. It’s a quilt I use on warm summer trips where I know the night temperatures will not go below 5°C (preferably a bit higher, though) and I absolutely LOVE ❤️ the amazing pack size of this quilt. It can be compressed to the size of a small loaf of bread with the cuben stuff-compression bag (18 g), something I can not do with my similarly great <a href="https://katabaticgear.com/shop/chisos-sleeping-bag/">Katabatic Gear Chisos 40°F quilt</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, so keep the Mosquitos away and stay protected from dew and rain splatters, I use the <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/millaris-bivy-sack/">As Tucas Millaris Bivy</a>. It’s 180 g light including the stuff sack, and is really spacious and also fits my winter sleeping bags. It works best against Mosquitos with two pegs to stake out the front, and then you can create with the elastic string a spacious interior space to sleep in, Mosquito-free. I used this sleep system also on my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/impressions-from-lemmenjoki-and-ivalojoki.html">recent trip in Lapland</a>, where it did a great job.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50137012222/in/dateposted/" title="Bed"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50137012222_214854e72b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bed" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="shelter">Shelter</h2>

<p>In addition to the aforementioned Bivy I also carry a tarp on my SUL Trips. You simply never can know when it starts to rain, or when the wind starts to blow so much that you want more protection. Hence a tarp. This <a href="https://www.gossamergear.com/collections/shelters-sleeping-pads/products/twinn-tarp">Gossamer Gear Tarp</a> isn’t made anymore, as I have a SUL Cuben version which weighs a mere 167 g incl. the straps. I also own &amp; can recommend the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=47cd1998-e608-4548-aa0f-3d33e964ad3a&amp;website_id=a037a589-aec6-4e81-920c-77b10ab91eff&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hyperlitemountaingear.com%2Fcollections%2Fultralight-backpacking-shelters-tents%2Fproducts%2Fflat-tarp">∞ Hyperlite Mountain Gear Flat Tarp</a> but it’s a bit heavier with all the straps. I still love tarps and especially with a bivy it’s a great setup, also in bad, rainy and windy weather. This tarp is really spacious, and pretty easy to pitch thanks to the Catenary curves - that way it’s simple to get a good, tight pitch.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50165394418/in/dateposted/" title="SUL Setup Summer 2020"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50165394418_6e73f70bca_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="SUL Setup Summer 2020" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="kitchen">Kitchen</h2>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/the-2nd-renaissance-of-esbit.html">Back in 2013 I wrote about Esbit</a> and the Solid Fuel Cook System from LiteTrail is still what I use today on SUL trips in the summer. It’s still amazingly compact, easy to use, efficient and at 90 g for the stove, ground + windscreen, pot with lid and the stuff sack hard to beat. I also have a tiny 8 g knife in the pot, my foldable Esbit Spoon - though in a pinch you also could simply use a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/lifeventure-titanium-long-handled-spoon/?pid=10239">∞long-handled spoon</a> instead - and the Esbit fuel tablets.</p>

<p>For water filtering and transport I have an old <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/salomon-soft-flask-std-42-water-bottle/?pid=10239">∞ 500 ml Flask</a> and a <a href="https://youtu.be/CneJY3F6zuY">Katadyn BeFree</a> - though I have heard a lot of good about the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/salomon-soft-flask-xa-filter-water-bottle/?pid=10239">∞ Salomon Soft Flask XA Filter</a> which is a bit lighter, but has a smaller volume. Nevertheless, I’d be curious to try the Salomon filter at some point - sadly a Waterfilter is something which one nowadays also should use in Finland, especially in areas where there’s a lot of other backpackers and hikers.</p>

<h2 id="hygiene">Hygiene</h2>

<p>My hygiene stuff is properly light - everything together a scant 37 g. I was lucky enough to find a foldable toothbrush years ago and I should have bought a few to stash away for the future. I also bring tooth silk and a tooth pick along because clean teeth are a bliss. I am using <a href="https://amzn.to/3fd2AgD">∞ Dent Tabs</a> since many years - they’re easy to pack and use, really light and leave less trash than a tube of tooth paste. I tried dehydrating my own Dent Tabs, but that wasn’t successful so the ones from DentTabs they are! For soap and cleaning I use nothing else than <a href="https://amzn.to/313znzB">∞ Dr. Bronners Peppermint</a>, I also have a few painkillers along, and a <a href="https://amzn.to/2BIt1xd">∞ Lipbalm from ClimbOn</a>. The Lipbalm also works really well for small scratches, wounds and blisters, so is proper Multiuse. It’s also made from 100% natural materials, which is always a plus in my book. All that hygiene stuff goes into a 10 year old ZPacks Cuben fibre bag, which still holds up really well. And yes, toilet paper is missing in the list and is needed, but won’t slow me down 😉</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50168619983/in/dateposted/" title="SUL Hygiene kit"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50168619983_1b5e51d53f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="SUL Hygiene kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="appareal">Appareal</h2>

<p>Lets start with the last bits of civilization: My wallet, keys, Suunto watch and phone. I bought a nice <a href="https://www.treadlitegear.co.uk/tread-lite-gear-zip-coin-card-case-wallet-from-83g-336-p.asp">wallet from Treadlite Gear</a> in which I have some Credit Cards and cash. My keys I usually leave at home/ car/ hotel depending on the trip, so these are not carried. On SUL trips I don’t take a camera as my Full Format <a href="https://amzn.to/2X9sE6d">∞Sony A7 III</a> with the <a href="https://amzn.to/3jQ8x6P">∞ GMaster 24-70 mm f/ 2.8 lens</a> is <strong>REALLY</strong> heavy, and the camera of my iPhone 7 is still plenty good for snaps in good weather. I am tempted to take my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/sony-rx100-iv-field-report.html">Sony RX 100 IV</a> at times, but then that is an additional 291 g … I also use the iPhone together with the <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/383480947">∞ Hikepack App</a> for navigation, and I can get 4 days of use out of the phone if it is in Airplane mode and with Battery Savings on. In addition I have the <a href="https://amzn.to/2X8JaUb">∞ Suunto Spartan Ultra</a> on my wrist which I use for tracking and navigation.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50032347368/in/dateposted/" title="Selfie on the Mälsorleden"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50032347368_ee84847a0d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Selfie on the Mälsorleden" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Depending on the weather + bugs to be expected I either wear shorts or a long pants. I have been a Houdini Friend in the past, and still am buying and wearing their garments if they suit me well, so most things are from Houdini - even if there are lighter options available, but I have these, the company does well for both people and the environment, so there’s no reason for me to buy different things. So, my <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/en-eu/clothing/shorts/ms-daybreak-shorts-249874?color=249874106">Daybreak Shorts</a> come on if I don’t expect a lot of Mosquitos and a lot of sun, and if the bugs are out then I put on the <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/en-eu/clothing/pants/ms-motion-pants-245174?color=245174174">Motion Lite Pants</a>. Both have zippered pockets, are durable, comfortable, have great freedom of movement and I can wear them for days on end.</p>

<p>On top I usually have a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/houdini-activist-tee-t-shirt/?pid=10239">∞ Houdini Activist T-Shirt</a> as the material mix of Merino Wool and Lyocell is working really well for me, I can have this on for a week without a problem. You might see white sweat stains after that time, but it doesn’t smell bad and is still comfy to wear. Depending on the bugs/ wind/ sunshine I also might be wearing the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start windjacket</a>, which is still - 7 years later! - my favourite wind jacket. Underneath I usually wear <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/ortovox-120-comp-light-boxer-merino-base-layer/?pid=10239">∞ Ortovox Comp Light Boxers</a>, at 54 g and being without any seams these are after much testing the best boxer shorts I have found. Their wide elastic “belt” doesn’t push or anything bad, it’s simply a really well designed boxer shorts which is very comfortable, again with the benefits of Merino Wool. If I wear shoes and socks, then the latter usually are <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/darn-tough-unstandard-stripe-crew-lightweight-with-cushion-sports-socks/?pid=10239">∞ Darn Tough Socks</a> as these are simply really good - comfortable &amp; durable.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50057615823/in/dateposted/" title="LUNA Sandals OSO Flaco"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50057615823_f1e1f665f9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="LUNA Sandals OSO Flaco" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Footwear-wise I like to hike in the summer in my <a href="https://bit.ly/2BFopb7">∞ Luna Sandals OSO Flaco</a>, these are simply AMAZING sandals and as soon as it is warm enough in Finland I will pretty much wear them all the time. But if it looks like there’s going to be rain, cold weather, lots of swamps to cross or mountains to climb, then other shoes come on. On my last trip I tried the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/inov-8-mudclaw-g-260-trail-running-shoes/?pid=10239">∞ inov-8 Mudclaw G 260</a> which let me done a bit durability-wise, in wet weather I’m a huge fan of the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/la-sportiva-crossover-2-dot-0-gtx.html">La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX</a>, but I also use shoes from <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/brands/salomon/trail-running-shoes/?pid=10239">∞ Salomon</a>, <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/on-cloudventure-peak-trail-running-shoes-bf/?pid=10239">∞ On Running</a> and many other models from <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/brands/la-sportiva/trail-running-shoes-bf/for--men/?pid=10239">∞ La Sportiva</a>.</p>

<p>In my pack I have three extra garment pieces on SUL Trips: The <a href="https://www.phdesigns.co.uk/waferlite-down-jacket-k-series">PHD WaferLite Down Jacket</a> which is hands-down the lightest and best down insulation piece I own for summer trips. 132 g light with a full zipper, it’s just the right jacket for fresh summer evenings where a cold wind blows or you need to huddle down in the rain under the tarp. The second and third apparel pieces are the <a href="https://www.montane.co.uk/mens-c1/unisex-podium-pull-on-p911">Montan Podium Pull-On</a> and <a href="https://www.montane.co.uk/unisex-c314/unisex-podium-pants-p910">Podium pants</a>. I wanted an SUL rain pants + jacket since ages, and was happy when Montane asked if I’d like to try them. These are quite a treat to carry at a combined weight of 203 g, and in the rain showers and thunderstorms I used them they have performed just fine and as you’d expect: They keep you dry.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49956161841/in/dateposted/" title="Öjenskogen Impressions"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49956161841_6fc623970f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Öjenskogen Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As seen above, I also wear a cap and sunglasses. My eyes are sensitive to the sun, so a pair of protective shades like the <a href="https://tidd.ly/3094EBX">∞ Oakley Latch</a> are mandatory for me on summer trips. The <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/patagonia-boardshort-label-funfarer-cap-cap/?pid=10239">∞ Patagonia Boardshort Funfarer Cap</a> is comfortable and has a closed back, which I prefer in Mosquito season. And while it isn’t in my list, if I expect <strong>A LOT OF MOSQUITOS</strong> then the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/sea-to-summit-nano-mosquito-headnet-mosquito-net/?pid=10239">∞ Sea to Summit Nano Mosquito Headnet</a> comes along (11 g extra, and so worth it!).</p>

<h2 id="food">Food</h2>

<p>I have a 95% Vegan diet since two years now, and it’s amazing how easy it is to eat healthy and tasty vegan food when outdoors. There’s a host of companies which make amazing vegan backpacking meals, so for people without the time to make meals yourself these are a really good option. I’m a huge fan of the <a href="https://tentmeals.co.uk/collections/main-meals">Tentmeals</a> meals &amp; breakfasts (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">My Patreons get a 25% Discount!</a>), the <a href="https://www.firepotfood.com/collections/firepot-dehydrated-meals/vegan">Firepot Vegan meals</a> are absolutely delicious and also the Vegan options from <a href="https://tidd.ly/2X2n0CX">∞ LYO Food</a> are always something to look forward to after a day of hiking or packrafting. From back in the day when I also was eating meat, fish and poultry I can recommend meals from the aforementioned brands and also <a href="https://realoutdoorfood.com/products/">REAL Turmat</a>.</p>

<p>Snack-wise I mix Chili Nuts and Honey-Roasted Nuts together, this is my absolute “<strong>Feel-Good Food</strong>” which helps me to stay motivated when I have a long day or a steep climb up a mountain. Similiarly I use <a href="https://tidd.ly/2P6YYSG">∞ Clif Bar Shot Bloks</a> as these are easy to consume, tasty, and the ones with coffein allow me to skip the coffee breaks if the day calls for it. Speaking of coffee, I use <a href="https://www.naturata.de/bio-produkte/kaffee-kakao/espresso-kaffee-sticks-bohnenkaffee-instant-25g/">Naturata Espresso Sticks</a>  since this year, it’s easier to get than than Starbucks Via, in my opinion even tastier, and it’s also Fair Trade and Organic.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50165422998/in/dateposted/" title="Light &amp; tasty food"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50165422998_a9c6bcd8a2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Light &amp; tasty food" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>

<p>This article, <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/z1a081">list</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/sYMGl8INJMo">video</a> show that it is nowadays extremely easy to carry really little &amp; very light equipment on your backpacking trips while still being safe, comfortable, well-fed, dry in the rain and warm at night. 95% of people hiking on maintained trails don’t need much more than what is shown in the article - and even if they do (a map and compass is a good addition, as could be a powerbank and maybe some fresh clothes for camp) the added weight still will have them carry less than what the majority of people seem to carry outdoors in Finland. Which is not to say those carrying more are doing something wrong, as they are not, though I often encounter these people bent forward from their heavy backpacks, which they put down as soon as an opportunity arises.</p>

<p>That gives the appearance that with a heavy backpack the hiking part of a backpacking trip isn’t enjoyed a lot, and for me that is where I see most of nature and I get the most enjoyment. With a light pack I can walk straight and unencumbered, I am able to let my eyes take in the surroundings - be it the Black-throated loon on the lake, the Reindeer which is grazing a few meters besides me on the fjell, the Marmot which is alerting it’s family of my arrival or the beautiful wildflowers which grow along the trail. For me the hiking part is where I see most on my trips, which makes me feel happy, and hence it is for me a lot more enjoyable to hike with a SUL Pack in the summer! I hope you try some of the things in this article, and if you have questions, feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a>!</p>

<p>This trip was spontaneous. I posted online, looking for a ride to Lapland, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oolaw/">Olli</a> replied. Turns out, Olli and I got along really well, and I think this was just the first trip we went on together. Well, sort of together, as I went to Lemmenjoki National park, hiking south through it, to the Repojoki river, which would join the mighty Ivalojoki river a bit later, while Olli continued to the impressive Kevo National park and it’s amazing canyon. I have 190 gb of Video to go through and edit, so for the moment please enjoy these photos from the trip, where also the weather was really fantastic (though there were too many Mosquitos and Black Flies for my liking).</p>

<p>Lemmenjoki National Park was surprisingly busy. You only can get here with an own car, but the Parking Lots were full and there was a steady flow of people using the shuttle boats from Njurgulahti to Kultahamina and back. I spent 3 days here, and had a great time - even though I had to wear my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody-windproof-jacket/?pid=10239">Alpine Start Hoody</a> almost all the time because of the Mosquitos!</p>

<p>After crossing Lemmenjoki I inflated <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/Anfibio-packrafts/Anfibio-Rebel-2K::889.html?language=en">my packraft</a> at the Repojoki bridge we had passed three days earlier by car, and started to paddle. First I had some headwind and safety concerns (paddling on your own in big, wild rivers is not recommended) but after the first rapids, lots of sunshine and warm weather my mood turned and I was able to enjoy the packrafting for this and the following days.</p>

<p>Gear of the trip is by the way the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/sea-to-summit-nano-mosquito-headnet-mosquito-net/?pid=10239">Sea to Summit Nano Mosquito Headnet</a>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A perfect weekend get-away from the city is the Björkö-Panike Trail in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Kvarken Archipelago. All you need is your packraft, a bivy and some water, and you’re in for a wild trip where you won’t encounter anyone else!</p>

<p>It’s Friday, I had a mediocre week, the weather forecast is amazing and we wanna go to the beach. I do feel like sleeping outside, though. <em>“Should we go to the Björköby beach?”</em> I ask my wife, <em>“Then I could go backpacking and you pick me up tomorrow in Panike?”</em>. <em>“Yes, that’s fine.”</em> Well, that went a lot easier than I expected. I pack my HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite pack with a few items, strap the Anfibio Rebel 2K packraft on top and slide the Wave paddle into the side pockets, and then we head out to the Archipelago.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50057619978/in/dateposted/" title="All along the Watchtower"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50057619978_e2052f4e83_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="All along the Watchtower" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We’re pretty much alone at the beach, it’s 23°C and a light breeze goes - perfect weather. The kids love it, there’s fish everywhere and they try to catch them - even successfully at times. Fish are released, water melon is eaten, and then it’s time for me to start hiking at 19:00 o’clock. I say good bye to my family and start walking on the familiar <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/a-family-hike-on-the-bodvattnet-runt.html">Bodvattnet Runt trail</a> towards the Långgrund fire place. The first kilometres are familiar, then I take a right and soon am swarmed by Mosquitos from the left, right, front and back. They don’t seem to be bothered by the repellant I sprayed on earlier, so all I can do is to hike faster. After 45 Minutes I arrive at the Fire shelter, which looks lovely.</p>

<p>I drop my pack on a bench, take off my sweaty shirt, and walk out on the jetty. A Barn Swallow circles me, flying low above the water. I see a pair of Whopper Swans feed between the small islets, and in the distance the birdwatching Tower and buildings of Svedjehamn can be seen. I check my map, and start looking for the trail to the other jetty, from where I will be heading into sea.</p>

<p>I reach a land tongue 10 minutes later after hiking on a largely overgrown trail. This next section only can be reached if you organize boat transfer in advance - or if you have your own packraft along. I roll out the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/Anfibio-Packrafts/Anfibio-Rebel-2K::889.html">Rebel 2K</a>, inflate it and put it down in the water so that the air in the tubes can cool down, so I can top it up before heading out. The wind is coming against me, but it’s only around 5 m/s so not too bad. After everything is packed aboard I sit down, close the spray deck and start to paddle. The sun shines on my right, it’s warm and I enjoy the sound of the water sloshing against the raft. It’s a very natural sound, and so relaxing.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50058433217/in/dateposted/" title="Packrafting on Djupfjärden"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50058433217_68e9c0bd22_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Packrafting on Djupfjärden" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I paddle south-west in the middle of the Baltic, left and right of me the rising lands and islands. There are sections where the water is not even 30 cm deep, and I am happy that with my packraft I’m sitting pretty high in the water. Arctic Terns fly above me and check out what I’m up to, more Whopper Swans are looking for food along the shores, Great Crested Grebes dive away when they see me coming, only to surface 20 m further away. And then there’s lots, and lots of gulls: Black-Headed Gulls, Common Gulls, Herring Gulls and Great Black-backed Gulls all fly, sit and swim around me. As the wind is pushing me back to where I come from I only can keep on paddling, and when I arrive behind an island I can take in the view. It’s beautiful.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50058189326/in/dateposted/" title="Landing at Sondasören"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50058189326_1be31a2a12_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Landing at Sondasören" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At 22:35 o’clock I land on the Sondasören island. According to my map there should be a place for camping here somewhere, but after a short stroll across the island and not finding it I decide to simply cowboy camp some 60 m up from the shore. I carry the packraft up, put it up as a sort of windbreak/ hoping it gives me some shadow in the early morning. I’m hungry after paddling some 3,5 km and hiking a similar distance, and after I rolled out my bivy I take out the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/msr-windburner-10-l-personal-stove-system-gas-stove/?pid=10239">MSR Windburner</a> and boil some of the water which I brought along. Because this being the Baltic, it’s salt water, and hence I carried 3,5 kg of water with me from the start, by far the heaviest item in my pack!</p>

<p>I prepare my <a href="http://tidd.ly/ade9e651">Nettle Curry from LYO Food</a>, have a cup of mint tea, and enjoy the view. The sun is still up, a beautiful dusk is falling over the islands, and I hear sheep baa across the island, as well as some bells ring. Later the next day I will find out that on my island and the one I’ll be traversing the next day around 200 sheep are grazing the whole summer, and I also will see them the next morning.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50057618453/in/dateposted/" title="Camp on Sondasören"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50057618453_10835d6ca1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Camp on Sondasören" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50057618083/in/dateposted/" title="Dinner!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50057618083_be2ccdec98_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dinner!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Close to midnight I slide into the <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/millaris-bivy-sack/">As Tucas Millaris Bivy</a>, put my head down on the still fantastic <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/therm-a-rest-neoair-uberlight-sleeping-mat/?pid=10239">NeoAir Uberlight</a> and pull the ZPacks 10° quilt a bit over me. It’s a warm night, and soon the Mosquitos start to appear above my mesh window. They can’t get to me, but I decide to grab some of the death twigs and create a small tripod from where I can hang the bivy so the mesh net isn’t close to my face. While out collecting the twigs I also admire the almost orange moon which is setting in the west. It is beautiful.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50057617788/in/dateposted/" title="00:53"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50057617788_d52a519818_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="00:53" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At 6:30 I’m awoken as a flock of sheep is having a look at me in my bivy, and as they see me sitting up they take flight. I switch the airplane mode of the phone off and check the weather forecast, as right now the sky is grey and high winds come from the North. Yep, even higher winds are forecasted, so instead of sleeping in I pack everything up and am before 7:00 o’clock back in my packraft. The wind is so strong that it picks up water from the sea, which has the effect of rain coming from the side. It looks worse than it actually is - I guess some things stuck from my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/iwg/">Wilderness Guide Education 10 years ago</a> - and 15 Minutes later I paddle up to the jetty at Slåttskäret. I carry everything up to the Laavu and have breakfast.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50058188321/in/dateposted/" title="Slåttskäret Laavu"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50058188321_92475bba91_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Slåttskäret Laavu" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The sun comes out, though the wind keeps up, and a while later I start my hike on the island. The trail here is at times easy to follow and see, and at other times it’s pretty over grown. It passes geological sites - witnesses of our last ice age - and more recent additions, like shelters for the sheep which are grazing on the island. Along the way I see several Heath Spotted Orchids and a young White-tailed deer stag jumps across the trail and into the forest after it saw and heard me. It’s a beautiful, warm and windy morning, the Mosquitos aren’t out in force yet, and I enjoy the short hike to the end of the island.</p>

<p>I arrive after 1,5 hours at the end of the trail, and again walk down to the jetty. By now there’s 10 m/s winds and the waves have white crowns. Happily the Wind comes from North East, which is from my side, and it will push me toward the land where I have to go. I inflate the Rebel 2K for the final time, pack my backpack inside and sit down in the raft. I pull the hood of my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody-windproof-jacket/?pid=10239">Alpine Start Hoody</a> over my cap, and push away from the jetty. The first few strokes are easy and no problem, but once I am in the wind it means <em>“All Hands on Deck”</em> as I need to keep the raft in the direction and keep on paddling, to not get pushed somewhere I don’t want to go, or worse. Towards the shore there’s some big waves and it’s a bumpy ride, but then again everything really is under control as I keep a calm head and know what I have to do (The first thing I should have done would have been to have a pfd along!).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50058428022/in/photostream/" title="10 m/s Wind"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50058428022_baab8d1637_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="10 m/s Wind" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50058185196/in/photostream/" title="Panike Harbour"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50058185196_b9723f4a3c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Panike Harbour" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>20 Minutes later I arrive in the harbour of Panike, pull the packraft out of the water and walk up to a picknick table. This is the end of the road, and it’s just as silent. There’s a few summer cottages, a handful of boats are tied at the pier, and a hare is sitting in the grass at the side of the road, wondering maybe what that big heap of plastic is which is laying there in the sun. I dry the raft, roll it up, and wait for my ride back to Vaasa, while the wind is bending the top of the trees around me. What a beautiful hike this was, with beautiful views and weather. If you ever visit Finland and already have hiked the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/06/the-10-best-hikes-in-finland.html">9 Best Hikes of Finland</a> and look for something new, consider this combined packrafting and hiking trip. I think it is great to try packrafting in a save environment, and it’s pretty lonely - great for a weekend hike!</p>

<p>Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic we’re all mostly <em>“stuck at home”</em> in our countries - which isn’t a bad thing at all, as this allows us to go explore where we live and pay taxes! This pandemic also has brought a lot of people into the outdoors, and obviously the first thing you should familiarize yourself with are the <a href="https://lnt.org">Leave No Trace principles</a> so you don’t <em>accidentally</em> leave your trash and poo somewhere where it does not belong - don’t be one of those jerks who throws trash into nature. Now that we have these essential rules out of the way, let me show you the gear you need when you go backpacking. The idea is to help you <strong>save money and only get what you REALLY need</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quick Definition! Hiking: The activity of walking in nature, but sleeping indoors. Backpacking: The activity of walking AND sleeping outdoors in nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="clothes">Clothes</h2>

<p>The Easiest and most difficult point right at the start. The easiest because I firmly believe that most people can go hiking in their normal sports clothes on their first trips. If you have a synthetic/ wind-resistant pants or shorts for running or sports, chances are these are fine for your first backpacking trip. Some things to keep in mind, though:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t wear jeans when backpacking. They are too warm, too heavy, stay wet forever if it rains, and are mostly uncomfortable and restrict your movement.</li>
  <li>Except on the hottest 30°C or more days, don’t wear cotton shirts. Like jeans, they need too long to dry and if it gets cool don’t keep you warm.</li>
  <li>Avoid heavy “hiking” boots, use trailrunning or sport shoes with a good, grippy sole instead.</li>
  <li>Invest into some good socks and underwear for hiking!</li>
  <li>You can take a (fleece) jogging pants, a comfy shirt and possibly some woolen socks for camp along</li>
</ul>

<p>It is very easy to spend thousands of £$€ on clothes for hiking, and completely unnecessary for a beginner. Some sports clothes or airy fabric trousers with good freedom of movement and maybe some wind resistance are fine, together with a synthetic or Merino wool T-shirt. Most people own a fleece jacket, which works fine for insulation on summer days, and most also own a rain jacket. If you really want to start to invest into clothes for backpacking I’d recommend getting a good pair of light trailrunning shoes. Now, you won’t be running, but these types of shoes are comfortable all day long, you are unlikely to get blisters in them, they have great grip on muddy, wet and slippery terrain and they also are light. Go on a few day hikes before you take them backpacking, to see if they work for you. In 99% of the cases, they do 😊!</p>

<p><em>A detailed article on garments for hiking and backpacking will follow this month, so stay tuned if this topic interests you!</em></p>

<p>And finally, under clothes - <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/swix-pro-trail-carbon-120-trekking-pole.html">trekking poles</a>. Some people swear on them for hiking, others are happy without them. I both like them when I need them - for example when fording rivers, hiking through swamps, and demanding terrain, and I also am happy without them. Hence I like Poles which fold up small and are light, so that when I carry them they fits nicely to the side of the pack. If trekking poles are for you - you might want to see for yourself and test some, maybe loan a pair from friends for a hike and see how you get on with them. However, if your shelter needs Poles - you probably will not get around using them!</p>

<h2 id="kitchen--water">Kitchen &amp; Water</h2>

<p>It’s also easy to spend a few hundred €$£ on the kitchen and water carrying stuff. For the start of your backpacking hobby, get a good water filter like the <a href="https://youtu.be/CneJY3F6zuY">Katadyn BeFree</a>. This filter is very easy to use, and while there sometimes are some durability issues with the flask the customer service from Katadyn is very good and quickly sends out replacement flasks. You might want to pick up a second light water bottle (I can recommend the <a href="https://cnocoutdoors.com/collections/vecto-family/products/2019-vecto-2l-28mm?variant=20550036357209">CNOC Vecto 2l</a>) if you hike in environments where there’s not a spring every few kilometres and for camp. I also always carry a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/10/kupilka-review.html">Kupilka Kuksa</a> - the bigger one is the ideal size to prepare TentMeals in, and also for a big cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998094941/in/photostream/" title="Water and drinking"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998094941_5880327b29_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Water and drinking" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I believe that gas stoves with a Piezo ignition are the most user-friendly for beginners and experts alike, and the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/primus-lite-gas-stove/?pid=10239">Primus Lite+ Stove</a> is the most affordable one in this segment. It is light, compact, available in a variety of nice colours and very easy to use. It works well for two people, and it is fast to bring water to a boil, too. Once you want to go backpacking more it is fine to do your research on <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/the-2nd-renaissance-of-esbit.html">other stoves</a>, but for beginners an easy and convenient to use gas stove is the best investment.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30287286992/in/album-72157675269849996/" title="Camp on the fourth morning"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/5680/30287286992_aeb90feb6a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Camp on the fourth morning" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="food--snacks">Food &amp; Snacks</h2>

<p>On a longer backpacking trip food and snacks will be the heaviest thing in your backpack. Food for a week weighs for me around 5 kg, give or take, and happily this gets lighter every day. I have a plant-based diet and it’s completely possible to have nutritious, tasty vegan backpacking meals every day for a week without that you feel like <em>“Uuuagh, again the same?!”</em>. If you eat everything, it gets even easier. My favourite vegan meals are from Tent Meals and my Patreons get a 25% discount on their orders, so it’s totally worth it to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">join my Patreon tribe</a> and save on these tasty meals. Also FirePot, LYO Food, BlåBand and REAL Turmat make good vegan backpacking meals, and as this is going to fuel your adventure, don’t save money on these. I made that mistake on my first backpacking trips, thinking that a normal “just add water” meal from the Supermarket is just as good, and I <strong>a)</strong> didn’t feel like eating them after two days and <strong>b)</strong> they don’t deliver the same amount of calories than the specialized backpacking meals. It feels expensive to spend 7 to 10€ on one backpacking dinner, but it’s really worth it - and if you’d be in a city, you would easily spend more than that on a dinner!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/41423900054/in/dateposted/" title="Dinner!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/950/41423900054_46cce273b3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dinner!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As for Snacks, I am a huge fan of honey-roasted and chili nuts with some chocolate raisins thrown in for variety. I also know that especially the Nuts will make you hugely popular with fellow hikers, so take enough to last you and a friend through the trip :) I also consume the <a href="https://www.clifbar.com/products/clif/bloks-energy-chews/black-cherry">ClifBar Bloks</a> as they are excellent to get fast energy, are tasty, and really easy to use. I have tried normal ClifBars on various trips, but for me they simply are <em>“too much”</em> and I prefer the Bloks + Nuts.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998095301/in/photostream/" title="Snacks"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998095301_6d1a8796db_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snacks" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Coffee, Tea and Hot Chocolate are my hot drinks staples when outdoors. I have a minimum of three <a href="https://www.naturata.de/bio-produkte/kaffee-kakao/espresso-kaffee-sticks-bohnenkaffee-instant-25g/">Naturata Espresso Sticks</a> per day with me, these are easier to source than the equally good Starbucks Via, then one or two bags of tea per day, and one bag of Hot chocolate per day, as my little treat before going to sleep. Other than that I drink water, water, water, just like home =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998346927/in/dateposted/" title="Tea, Coffee, Hot Chocolate"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998346927_3a6581e412_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tea, Coffee, Hot Chocolate" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="hygiene--first-aid">Hygiene &amp; First Aid</h2>

<p>Thanks to the Pandemic we all know that we should wash our hands, outdoors this is maybe even a tad more important as we usually touch stones, trees, roots, plants and dirt when we scramble up places or walk through nature. So a good bio-degradable soap (I recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/2URUK51">Dr. Bonners Mint</a>) needs to come along, as well as a small bottle of Disinfectant. You always should brush your teeth, so a tooth brush, some tooth silk or a tooth pick, and a bio-degradable toothpaste (I prefer <a href="https://amzn.to/3hf6aJz">Dent Tabs</a> by far) need to go into the Hygiene kit, and then anything else one might want or need (stuff for contact lenses for example). I also always carry a ClimbOn LipBalm as it is great to not get dry lips and also can be applied to mosquito bites or small cuts. If you are popular with Mosquitos, an insect repellant is good to take along, or you use a headnet and long clothes to keep them off. Similarly sunscreen is useful on hikes where there is no shade and you expect to hike in the sun. You don’t need to buy these things except maybe the soap and disinfectant - use on your first hikes the same things you have at home.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998094766/in/photostream/" title="My Hygine Kit"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998094766_6ca06ba24a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="My Hygine Kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My First Aid kit is absolut minimalist, there’s a small bottle of mint oil (it works great against headaches for me), a few painkillers and band-aids in there, and that is it. I also have here a small repair kit - some patches for my air mattress, some duct tape, a security needle and that’s that. If I <strong>really</strong> need medical attention I prefer to call for help instead of trying to patch myself up with some surgical dressings which you find in the 1st Aid kits you can buy everywhere. And as in my Hygiene and First Air Kit I also have a <em>“large”</em> towel I can use that as a bandage if I feel I can take care of myself. Speaking of the towel, I long thought I don’t need it, but it has proven to be something that is multi-functional and hence comes along again: I can dry myself after a dip in a river or lake, wipe the dew from my shelter in the morning, hold a hot pot with it or, as above, use it as a band-aid 😃</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49997574068/in/photostream/" title="FA Kit"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49997574068_231c047b73_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="FA Kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="backpack">Backpack</h2>

<p>Now actually I’d put the backpack as the latest item you buy, but as this item sits totally in-between day hiking and backpacking I feel I can not talk about it at the end. However, I recommend getting this as the last item if possible, simply as it means you can purchase one which fits all the gear and food which you will have for your backpacking trips. Backpacks are a difficult topic and what works for one person does not necessarily work for another one. If you have a small, local outdoor shop go visit them, but don’t let them sell you the most expensive or heavy backpack. Osprey and Gregory are two brands which make nowadays good lightweight backpacks with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/01/osprey-levity-45-review.html">Exos</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/11/osprey-exos-48-review.html">Levity</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/gregory-optic-48.html">Optic</a> (women models are available for these, too!) and these are the models you should ask for in your shop. A backpack which has around 50 l is a good volume to aim for, with some careful packing it is good for all the gear a backpacking beginner takes along, plus the food, and this size pack also still works fine for day hikes as you can compress them nicely.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49997573963/in/photostream/" title="Packs!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49997573963_f4ee567bc6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Packs!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now real ultralight backpacking brands like <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de">HUCKEPACKS</a>, Sierra Designs, Six Moon Designs and Gossamer Gear, to name just a few, are pretty much only available online. If you want, it is totally worth it to purchase one of their backpacks, though you’ll need to measure your back length, make decisions on materials and features you want, which is already quite a bit of research - of course you just can <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">read my reviews</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hendrikmorkel">watch my videos</a> to do that research, and buy accordingly 😃 But again, I believe that a beginner should visit a independent, local gear shop and ask for one of these backpacks mentioned above, and try if they work for her or him. So far 100% of the people who got one of these packs after my recommendation are really happy with them, which is why I feel confident in recommending them (they are great packs, too!). If you then decide to pursue backpacking as a hobby you can get one of the lighter packs from the cottage brands!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44199759745/in/album-72157702073100795/" title="Storådörren Valley from the other side n better weather"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1903/44199759745_b4b7e1753e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Storådörren Valley from the other side n better weather" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="shelter">Shelter</h2>

<p>While a backpack usually doesn’t cost more than 200€ with the shelter and sleep system we get into an area where things get pricey. My recommendations here are to get good quality kit which does not break the bank for a beginner, if one wants to go backpacking more there’s always the option to get something different. I think most people want something which keeps bugs out (as them  🕷 🦂 are out in force in the summer). The <a href="https://www.tarptent.com/product/double-rainbow/">Double Rainbow from Tarptent</a> is a proven design at a really good price. A tent with a similar construction, slightly heavier but way easier to get in Europe and elsewhere, is the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/msr-elixir-2-2-man-tent/?pid=10239">MSR Elixir 2</a>. If your budget is a bit higher then the <a href="https://www.outdoorline.sk/en/tents/big-agnes-fly-creek-hv-ul2-ultralight-tent">Big Agnes Fly Creek HV UL2</a> or the <a href="https://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/equipment-c3/tents-shelters-c25/two-person-tents-c26/lunar-duo-explorer-2p-tent-p3325">Six Moon Designs Lunar Duo Explorer 2P Tent</a> are very good picks.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49997180938/in/dateposted/" title="Camp"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49997180938_ed7115939b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Camp" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I myself really like to sleep under a Tarp or in a Pyramide-style shelter. The <a href="https://locusgear.com/items/hapi-sil/?lang=en">Locus Gear Hapi Sil</a> is an amazing Pyramide tent, the <a href="https://www.gossamergear.com/collections/shelters-sleeping-pads/products/twinn-tarp">Gossamer Gear Twinn Tarp</a> is an absolute Classic which is easy to pitch and has a lot of dry space under it, and the <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/millaris-bivy-sack/">As Tucas Millaris Bivy Sack</a> works with either of these shelters or on it’s own if the sky is clear!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/38085020741/in/dateposted/" title="Locus Gear Hapi Sil in the morning"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4469/38085020741_56f5f2ece7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Locus Gear Hapi Sil in the morning" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If you go backpacking in Finland, Sweden or Norway you also might be able to not take a shelter at all, as you could sleep simply in one of the hundreds of free, open Wilderness Huts. The problem which might arise is that the hut is full and you can’t sleep there, so having a shelter along is always recommended. There are Huts in Finland which you can reserve, so the <em>“The Hut is full”</em> Problem won’t arise. And while these huts are AMAZING I do like to sleep outside, hear the birds chirp and the wind blow through the leafs. Plus you won’t be awoken by other hut inhabitants when they leave at 5:00 o’clock.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37340978576/in/dateposted/" title="Strömskojan Inside"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4435/37340978576_f69dcfda81_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Strömskojan Inside" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sleep-system">Sleep System</h2>

<p>Your sleep system consists of a sleeping pad, a quilt or sleeping bag and possibly a pillow (I use a insulation jacket and fold it into a pillow). The <a href="https://youtu.be/5oXFCJi0TII">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Uberlite</a> is an outstanding mattress, but maybe beginners are a bit better off with getting a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite.html">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite</a> as it is more durable and cheaper while still being light and compact. If you like to sleep on a hard underground, then the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/exped-flexmat-plus-sleeping-mat/?pid=10239">Exped Flexmat Plus</a> is a great pick as it can not break and at 40€ it is really cheap, while being very comfortable.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998095396/in/photostream/" title="Sleeping well"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998095396_73cbece14b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sleeping well" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At home you sleep under a duvet, and outdoors the next best thing is a quilt. I really like my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/as-tucas-sestrals-quilt.html">As Tucas Sestrals Quilt</a>, also the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/enlightened-equipment-revelation-quilts.html">enLIGHTened Equipment Revelation Quilts</a> are a very good pick, and if money is no issue I suggest getting a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/01/katabatic-gear-sawatch-quilt.html">Katabatic Gear Quilt</a>. If social and sustainable issues are important to you, have a look at the good <a href="http://tidd.ly/3d3b83f5">Vaude Alpstein 450</a>, which is a really good quilt. Again, there’s a lot of options here, but amongst those which I mentioned you can find something which suits your budget and needs!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42298562271" title="As Tucas Sestrals Quilt, front view"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/878/42298562271_534ffe1d92_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="As Tucas Sestrals Quilt, front view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="navigation-maps-and-extras">Navigation, Maps and Extras</h2>

<p>The final point on my list is about the small items which are needed to not get lost and to remember. A map and compass are pretty useful when going into nature, and I recommend for the first few trips that you stay on trails and use the map to get safely from A to B. Also an App like <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/383480947">HikePack</a> is very good to navigate (and there’s a free version!), and might be easier to use than a compass and map for beginners (despite this, the latter are important skills to learn and master!). I also carry a small <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/expedition">Field Notes Brand notebook</a> + pen with me, and obviously a camera. Unless you’re already a photographer and own a good camera, just use your phone for photos. If this is an aspect you’d like to pursue more passionately at some point, feel free to hit me up on Twitter and ask me about camera recommendations! Finally, a headlamp like the <a href="http://tidd.ly/d33332f9">Petzl Bindi</a> is good to have along if you need to get out at night or if you get up early/ stay up late. Here in the North it’s something you not necessarily need in the summer, as it doesn’t really get dark.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/39677567295/in/dateposted/" title="Plans"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4629/39677567295_fd946587cb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Plans" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The best thing is if you simply could ask a good friend (like me, right Tumppi ;) who totally is into outdoor stuff and has a bunch of gear to kit you out for your first backpacking trip. That way you can see what works for you and don’t need to make purchases which may work well for you. But not everyone has that friend, so the next best thing is to do your research online, learn from other people’s mistakes and experience, and buy the right gear from the start (this does involve trusting these friends, and not deciding to throw away all the recommendations and simply buy what you think is best, just to realize after some use that the knowledgable friend actually was right all along…). To make checking the gear you have &amp; need easier I made <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bjsgcr5KmPblSjvjvQs3To6iCU7LYqNBczFazSJNX80/edit?usp=sharing">this Checklist</a> which you can copy &amp; paste or print out. With the list in your hands you make sure you don’t waste money on kit which you don’t need, and my tips here hopefully help you figure out which gear is worth getting. The most important thing, however, is to enjoy being outdoors.</p>

<p>Backpacking in nature is the single best way to connect to the natural environment, learn to appreciate it and see why it is so important to protect wild places. For us humans going into nature has a tremendously positive effect on our mental health, creativity and also our physical health, as several scientific articles have highlights in the past couple of years. And the whole experience of backpacking gets more enjoyable &amp; fun the less unnecessary &amp; heavy equipment we carry along while outdoors. With this article read you now know what gear you need for your first backpacking trip, and I hope it will be a most memorable one!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>“Finland, Finland, Finland, it’s the country where I want to be”</em>  is a great song by Monty Python, and now that you have it stuck in your head you probably want to find out about the best hiking destinations in this Northern European country which is well-known for its 180.000 lakes, 75% forest cover and more than a million of Saunas!</p>

As you know: I’m keepin’ it real and tell you how it is - I maintain full editorial control of the content published on Hiking in Finland.

<p>Finland has the Everyman’s Right, and with it come one <a href="https://www.nationalparks.fi/en/worldheritagesites">UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site</a>, seven <a href="https://www.nationalparks.fi/en/nationalhikingareas">National Hiking Areas</a>, ten <a href="https://www.nationalparks.fi/en/wildernessareas">Wilderness Areas</a>, 40 <a href="https://www.nationalparks.fi/en/nationalparks">National Parks</a>, more than two dozen <a href="https://www.nationalparks.fi/en/othernaturesites">Nature Sites</a> and hundreds of open Wilderness Huts and Lean-to Shelters, which are accessible for every hiker, bikepacker and packrafter visiting them. You can enjoy a life-time of outdoor adventures in this country, without seeing anything twice.</p>

<p>As Finland is a large country it might be difficult to pick an outdoor destination to visit - as you see above, there’s quite some options. That’s why I got together with four outdoor-loving friends and asked them for their one recommendation where they’d go hiking in Finland, and together we created this amazing bucket list of the best hiking destinations in Finland! Any of the destinations are worth visiting in any season, so don’t be troubled if you see snow (or the lack of it!). We hope you enjoy our recommendations, find one which suits exactly what you’re looking for, and wish you a great time if you plan to visit!</p>

<h2 id="hetta-pallas-trail">Hetta-Pallas Trail</h2>

<p>Fresh in my mind is the Hetta-Pallas Trail, which I skied in March this year. Besides amazingly cozy huts the scenery is MINDBLOWING. No wonder this is one of Finland’s first National Parks and one of the oldest hiking trail (it was known as Pallas-Ounastunturi National Park till 2005, when it was doubled in size as the Ylläs-Aakenus Nature Reserve was put together with the old National Park). What I loved the most on the Hetta-Pallas Trail were the fjells and the views. Going south from Hetta this amazing view of the fjells opens up, and once you have climbed the first summit you can see far into the distance and enjoy this breath-taking scenery. In the summer the trail takes you across the highest summits, and is definitely something I will return for!</p>

<h2 id="st-olavs-trail">St. Olavs Trail</h2>

<p>The St. Olavs trail is a former pilgrimage path leading from Turku in Finland, to the Åland Islands, through Sweden and all the way to Trondheim in Norway. The Finnish part of the trail is leading you through the Finnish archipelago with stunning views of the countless islands. The trail is pretty easy and accessible, with accommodation options along the way if you don’t feel like camping. For those who love the water, this trail is a true gem - and my favourite in Finland.</p>

<h2 id="sipoonkorpi-national-park">Sipoonkorpi National Park</h2>

<p>As we now are already pretty far south in Finland, it’s good to shed some light “<em>on the other National Park near Helsinki</em>”. Nuuksio is normally already pretty busy with hikers, and now that everyone and their dog head into the forest you better jump on a bus to Sipoonkorpi National Park. You can find some great trails and spots for a lunch here, Sipoo is small enough to explore it in a day if you hike fast, and big enough for a long weekend to see all parts of the National Park and not needing to hurry through it.</p>

<h2 id="repovesi-national-park">Repovesi National Park</h2>

<p>Finnish climbers love Repovesi National Park, as it is home to some of the highest rock climbing routes - and definitely the most picturesque. Where else can you take a rowboat to the start of a climbing route? But also hikers, backpackers and packrafters love Repovesi National Park with its great hanging bridges, beautiful lakes and channels for paddling, not to mention the great viewing points from the top of the hills which dot the forested landscape. What is unique, too, is the possibility to use a fox-ferry, and if you want you to paddle with a packraft or canoe here, you’ll find great lakes &amp; channels which connect them.</p>

<h2 id="helvetinjrvi--seitseminen-national-parks">Helvetinjärvi &amp; Seitseminen National Parks</h2>

<p>I have been a lot to these two National Parks, as they were the closest to the city of Tampere where I lived for five years. They’re pretty, with great infrastructure, cultural sights and always good for a surprise - be it the warm water of the lakes which are inviting for a swim, or the tasty mushrooms which you can find in the forest. There’s surprisingly few people around during the week, but in the weekends the famous spots attract a lot of people - these can be avoided if you go to the less popular (but just as pretty) spots in the two National Parks!</p>

<h2 id="ruka-kuusamo-area">Ruka-Kuusamo Area</h2>

<p>The Ruka-Kuusamo area and Oulanka National Park are one of the most popular hiking destinations in Finland - and for a good reason. This area is known for old forests, deep river canyons &amp; rapids and in the winter you´ll find the most picturesque snowy trees here. The location in North-East Finland makes this place an interesting combination of Arctic Nature and Siberian Taiga, you can see it in both Flora and Fauna. The most famous trail is the Bear’s Trail but there are many other options for hikers too. Scrambling up the Konttainen Hill and gazing the Midnight Sun is one of our traditions that we do every Summer. There are so many beautiful Outdoor destinations in Finland but for it’s versatility this area is definitely one of our top destinations!</p>

<h2 id="urho-kekkonen-national-park">Urho Kekkonen National Park</h2>

<p>The Urho Kekkonen National Park is something of a national treasure in Finland. It has it all: Amazing off-the-beaten track backpacking through the fjells, great views, lovely lakes and rivers, cozy huts and a lot of Saunas in which to relax after a day of hiking. It is the choice for more advanced backpackers who know how to navigate and feel comfortable to hike away from the few trails, and who obviously also know how to practice Leave-No-Trace. If that’s you - start planning a hike in this beautiful National Park!</p>

<h2 id="pyrisjrvi">Pöyrisjärvi</h2>

<p>Almost like sitting in the shoulders of the Maiden of Finland (Suomineito), the Pöyrisjärvi wilderness area is a dream hiking destination for experienced hikers and people who love to fish. The area takes its name from Lake Pöyrisjärvi, surrounded by the photogenic sand dunes, large woodlands and hilly fells. Endless hiking possibilities will take you around the wilderness as long and as far as you have power to go. Pro tip: bass loves the combination of black, blue and gold. Try it, and you might have a chance to cook a delicious dinner for your crew! Remember to bring some butter and salt along!</p>

<h2 id="ksivarsi-wilderness-area">Käsivarsi Wilderness Area</h2>

<p>My favorite hiking destination in Finland is Käsivarsi Wilderness Area. While I occasionally enjoy cruising down a well-groomed trail, nothing beats walking off-trail in a remote wilderness. While there’s a good trail system to explore parts of the area, my favorite thing is to take the seaplane to one of the lakes in the furthest corners of the area, next to the Norwegian border, and then hike my way back to Kilpisjärvi.</p>

<p>One good thing which came out of the COVID-19 Pandemic is that we now go hiking every Sunday with the family. All four of us look forward to the outing, and some rain in the forecast doesn’t cancel our plans. We have rain clothes, after all - and the kids are even happier as it allows them to jump in every puddle along the trail! Good thing that we life in the sunniest part of Finland and that it hasn’t rained a lot here yet.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49930250338/in/dateposted/" title="Studying the map"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49930250338_fa05a493d5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Studying the map" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The most import things for our family hikes are: Some breads as a snack, a Müsli bar treat which we share, some water or hot juice to drink and proper clothes for the occasion. As it gets warmer now in Vaasa, it’s nice to wear less - maybe a couple more weeks and I can slip on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a>!</p>

<p>Last Sunday we went to a close-by nature area, and hiked some two kilometres to a birdwatching tower. While the snow is gone since months (it was another terrible winter here in the south), spring comes late in this part of Finland and only during the past week the trees started to drive out the first buds and leaves. In another week everything will be over, and the trees will be green and summer will start!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49931073187/in/dateposted/" title="Layers"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49931073187_c82f947aff_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Layers" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>An important aspect of our family hikes is to keep them short-ish and interesting. Both kids much prefer forest trails to gravel roads, and around 2 km one-way seems a good distance for us right now - with a break and then another 2 km back to the start. We parents also prefer the forest trails, they feel much nicer because you’re “closer” to nature. On this hike there were also no Mosquitos, and only little noise pollution from the nearby roads.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49930250643/in/dateposted/" title="Green"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49930250643_3691e04f41_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Green" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There were surprisingly many families out on this trail - which is good to see, as it means more people start to value their local nature, and maybe become more engaged in protecting the environment.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49930765536/in/dateposted/" title="Dot"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49930765536_245705b8b8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dot" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the end it was a relaxed, good little hike. We saw a white-tailed eagle from the bird watching tower (even without my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/05/vortex-optics-viper-hd-binoculars.html">binoculars</a>!) and lots of smaller singing birds, which were merrily chirping in the green woods. Our little family hikes make us all feel better, and especially I really value these little adventures outdoors.</p>

<p>I started to get the first signs of depression last week, I have to admit. I especially feel bad because I lost around 90% of my income, I had to postpone the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/european-trail-days-2020.html">European Trail Days Festival</a> and many work trips, with other cooperations also falling through. I am not one to normally write and share such personal things, but I want to show you that while things are OK here (we can pay the bills and have food on the table each day) AND Social Media posts look like Life is A-OK, I still feel the negative consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic, and hence I decided to break with my normal approach and share these thoughts with you.</p>

<p>The first “hint of a depression” is giving me the feeling that I wanna fix it by buying stuff, to get a quick dopamine hit of knowing of getting something new and shiny. However, I also know this does not work for me. If at all, it is a very brief dopamine hit, then I start to check tracking updates a couple of times each day (which makes me more anxious), and when it then arrives I unpack it, smile, and am unhappy again. Shopping is not a sustainable fix for me, and I happy am pretty well able to refrain from shopping, also under normal circumstances.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48753720577/in/dateposted/" title="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48753720577_1b04a4e48e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With going outdoors also being more difficult right now - both kids are at home, my wife is working from home and as I’m basically unemployed (I am finishing up a lot of projects, though) - it is also not easy for me to go backpacking, which usually is my medicine to these situations. I can’t go out to shoot videos or go hiking, as I have to take care of the kids. At 4 and 8 they are well able to take mostly care of themselves and they play nicely together, but every 15 to 45 minutes there is a “Dad” call which needs attention. And with me being the one who has little paying work, I take care of them.</p>

<p>Now as you might know, I got back into painting miniatures and playing tabletop and boardgames several years ago, and this is actually something which helps me to cope. In the evenings (and sometimes also during the day) I go to my hobby room, where I have a nice painting corner set up, and then I delve into painting terrain or miniatures. I can get lost in the little details, forget about the bad things, and have fun and relaxation while painting. I also got a 3D Printer which is a nice new toy, but also a lot of work. This hobby does give me happiness and keeps me busy, which is positive.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49886519247/in/dateposted/" title="Hobbying away."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49886519247_02c6e64e43_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Hobbying away." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Another thing which usually helps me is to do sports, like trailrunning. Sadly I have had very little motivation to put <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">my running clothes and shoes</a> on and go for a 5 or 10 km run in the nearby forest. After a long day taking care of the kids and doing some work, there’s just little power left to motivate myself to go outside. Which is a shame, because I know it would make me feel much better, if I did so.</p>

<p>So, I really miss being outdoors. Under normal circumstances I am skiing, backpacking or bikepacking &amp; packrafting once a month for a week, but right now we do not have normal circumstances. By the way, I fully support Lockdown measures and social distancing, I think the Finnish government is doing a tremendous job of keeping the population safe and healthy. But yeah, I miss not being able to go hiking with my best friend - we planned to go hiking in Luxembourg or Belgium right about now - or that my ski seasons was cut so short.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49716645042/in/dateposted/" title="Happy!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49716645042_fc0974f19e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Happy!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On the positive side of this Pandemic, it’s really great to sleep till 8:00 in the morning - usually we have to get up earlier to bring kids to school and kindergarden, and being able to sleep “long” and have a relaxed breakfast and a slow start into the day is positive. But that’s really about the positive things I can think of. Well, there’s less pollution from air traffic, but that’s about it.</p>

<p>So, all this is more of a way to say: While Social Media <em>might</em> give the impression that everything is great with me (I try not to give that impression, but pretty photos might give it nevertheless), the truth is that I also feel the consequences of this situation mentally, but that thanks to my family and my indoors hobbies I am coping alright. I miss going on backpacking trips and travelling, but I do think it is necessary to protect the people who are at risk. I hope that it will be soon possible to go outdoors sort-of-normally, at the latest this summer, and that I will have a great autumn backpacking trip with my best friend - and I hope that for all people who love &amp; need the outdoors for their mental wellbeing like me.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of keeping my gear sorted on my hikes, and a problem I encountered on many trips in the past is that I miss a bag or pouch for essential stuff which I wanna keep close but not really in my pockets or inside my backpack. Enter the fanny pack (<em>or a bum bag in British English</em>). Since seven plus years <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/10/shoulder-and-multi-use-packs-for-hiking-and-backpacking.html">I use different kinds of shoulder and fanny packs</a>, so the <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/beipack/">HUCKEPACKS beiPACK</a> is a logical addition to my HUCKEPACKS Fanboy collection. On my hike in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/09/impressions-from-the-far-north.html">Hammastunturi</a> last autumn 🍂 I still used a <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/hipbelt-pocket/">HUCKEPACKS Hipbelt Pocket</a> to store essentials, but now that I have upgraded to the more spacious beiPACK I think the Hipbelt Pocket will only come out to play as a … Hipbelt pocket =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49862091341/in/dateposted/" title="beiPACK and Hipbelt Pocket 02"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49862091341_54fb62f1b4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="beiPACK and Hipbelt Pocket 02" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now while theoretically the beiPACK is double the volume of the Hipbelt Pocket, I have found it fits actually more than double the content (as for how much, <a href="https://youtu.be/bZIgPo1rubg">watch the Video</a> above!). At 74 g with the strap (or 42 g without it) the beiPACK is not much heavier than a Hipbelt Pocket, but the possibility to load it up with a map, snacks, an SUL hardshell and a Pocket camera makes it a lot more useable for me - especially as a wee summit pack which I can load up with the aforementioned gear at camp and then head out to explore the hills and forests around my ⛺️</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49861560053/in/dateposted/" title="Closed beiPACK"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49861560053_bd657dce67_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Closed beiPACK" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49861559858/in/dateposted/" title="beiPACK top view"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49861559858_5f84dd3241_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="beiPACK top view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49861559738/in/dateposted/" title="beiPACK and Hipbelt Pocket 03"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49861559738_290980ef25_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="beiPACK and Hipbelt Pocket 03" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The beiPACK also comes with a flat inside pocket, which is where I keep my passport, notebook + pen and other documents, and a large main compartment. It’s waterproof and has a comfortable 25 mm wide strap with durable and easy-to-use buckles, which obviously can be totally removed if you decide to carry it in front of your chest, connected to your pack. You also can strap it around your pack, if you don’t like to carry it around your shoulders (which is my preferred way to carry it).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49862404742/in/dateposted/" title="Happy Hiker!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49862404742_59be7a5eca_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Happy Hiker!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I especially love the limited edition <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/specials/beipack-special/">beiPACK Special</a> series, where a dozen different beiPACKS in various materials and colours are available. It definitely wasn’t easy to pick a colour I have to say, but I am super happy with the darkgreen woven DCF version I picked 😊 So if you have the problem of having small items in your pockets and flying around in your pack, solve the problem by getting a beiPACK!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Five weeks in self-distancing Mode, and many of us are sitting at home with itchy feet: When can we go hiking &amp; camping again? I’m using this time to think about &amp; plan the future hikes I wanna do, once the lockdown is lifted!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49812710111/in/dateposted-public/" title="Planning!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49812710111_6d4b456c63_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Planning!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Air traffic is now 29% of what it was pre-COVID-19, trains and busses are also substantially less frequent, cars are standing at home unused, and on the other side you have National Parks, Wilderness Areas and our beautiful outdoors which is recovering, with animals appearing where they previously have been seen long ago and air pollution in cities is dropping, too. At home we also get busy thinking about the outdoors, and our post-poned outdoor adventures. I’m no different, and while I am sad about the cancelled ski trips this spring, I’m looking forward to the hiking, packrafting and bikepacking trips in the not-too-distant future!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49812125413/in/dateposted-public/" title="Planning"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49812125413_7ab1c1908b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Planning" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now, as I expect that planes will remain grounded (AMAZING for the environment and our #ClimateCrisis) I will continue to travel more by train and bus. I love to travel by train: You can walk around while the train rides, eat in the train restaurant when you get hungry, play games, the kids can jump around on the playground in the kids waggon, there’s functional toilets which are not the size of a shoebox, watch movies on Youtube or surf the internet, and one of the best things: Simply watch out of the window and observe the environment which passes you by. In Europe you can get quickly and affordably to most corners of the continent, and where the train tracks stop there’s usually a bus waiting to take you to the next destination.</p>

<p>Well, I currently also am stuck at home (relaxing while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwYqDhtJj1x3DXy4IPCxL2A/">painting tabletop Miniatures and terrain</a>) and besides the occasional day hike with the family or cycling along the coast I am already pondering where to go in the summer and autumn. It’s very, very likely in Finland, with small chances of heading to close-by Norway and Sweden, but unlikely to be further away. <strong>But hey!</strong> <strong>Finland is AWESOME!</strong> Beautiful, crystal-clear lakes for paddling, amazing forests full of tasty bilberries, soft trails and great camping spots, and once autumn comes by the beautiful colours of nature will delight us!</p>

<p>The best thing that you can do right now, if you’re under lockdown and can not go wild camping, is to plan that next trip. <em>Anticipation is the greatest joy</em>, as we say in German. Get in a great mood by taking out your wish list of local, national trails you wanna hike or cycle, grab some maps and start planning. And not just the hike, also on how you get there (also if schedules might not yet be that reliable, so keep that in mind) - and remember my chorus of praise for trains above 😉 And as you have had to post-pone a few hikes, maybe also stay at a local B&amp;B or Hostel at the end of your backpacking trip, as a warm shower and a tasty meal before travelling home is what you deserve, and the local entrepreneurs will be grateful for your support after months of empty rooms.</p>

<p>That’s it. Planning that next hike helps you keep a positive outlook on this situation, and going over maps and pondering what to eat (and maybe ordering already some food for that trip) helps you to spend your time productively instead of watching Netflix. Maybe plan a hike that is 90% off-trail! Or a hike which visits all the sights you wanted to visit &amp; see already since a long time! Or a hike where you come out at a great Pizza place at the end 🍕 🤗 Right now there’s enough time to plan that next hike in great detail, and get the food &amp; supplies you need for it, so that when you can get back outdoors, <strong>you are ready!</strong></p>

<p>In that sense: Stay healthy, wash your hands and plan that next outdoor trip!</p>

<h2 id="carrying-more-stuff-from-home">Carrying more stuff from home</h2>

<p>As <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/ultralight/">Ultralight Backpackers</a> we try to minimize the amount of stuff we carry into the outdoors, so that the hiking part of our trip is more enjoyable. In the minds of many they envision us as freezing at night, getting wet in the rain, and forgoing any and all comfort in our pursuit to save some weight on our backs. <strong>That is nonsense.</strong> Ultralight backpackers sleep warm and comfortable, stay dry in the rain, and carry comfortable backpacks and clothes on their trips. The one thing we rarely (<em>never?</em>) carry, however, is a chair. Not an <em>“ultralight”</em> one that’s <em>“only”</em> 510 g, nor a stool which is 350 g. That’s a substantial amount of extra weight to carry around the whole day, just so that you could sit down for a while in the evening in camp. We just sit on the ground.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49752951781/in/dateposted-public/" title="BTR Stool"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49752951781_ec568dfe81_b.jpg" width="1024" height="499" alt="BTR Stool" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="whats-wrong-with-sitting-on-the-ground">What’s wrong with sitting on the ground?</h2>

<p>The idea of carrying a chair into nature is so strange to me, but then I also am standing at home at my desk since 10+ year. If you walk three kilometres from the bus stop to the campground and the plan is to sit till midnight at the campfire 🔥 and drink beer, then yeah, maybe a chair is ok. But for a backpacking trip? Hardly. I simply don’t get why people would want to carry a chair on a backpacking trip, when sitting on the ground, on a pad or inside your tent porch, does an absolutely great job of keeping your ass dry and comfortable. Do you really need to have a chair in which you can lean back? Why not just lay down?</p>

<p>During breaks I often don’t even bother taking out a pad, and just sit down on the soft ground next to the trail, or a fallen tree if it presents itself. Comfortable. Easy. Simple. Fast. No extra weight. No assembly required.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49752957351/in/dateposted-public/" title="GearJunkie Chairs"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49752957351_569c6734e1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="925" alt="GearJunkie Chairs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="i-like-rocks-fallen-trees-and-my-ccf-pad">I like rocks, fallen trees and my CCF pad</h2>

<p>Maybe I’m wrong with my opinion, and sitting on a chair in the outdoors is actually far superior to sitting on my piece of <a href="https://bit.ly/2wqpWPH">ZLite</a> or <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/exped-flexmat-plus-sleeping-mat/?pid=10239">Flexmat</a>, a fallen tree, a rock or in my tent porch. Who knows - I certainly don’t, as I don’t own any outdoor backpacking chair and so can not speak about the benefit of sitting in one. It does, however, feel like a fad and an absolutely unnecessary item to carry into the outdoors. It feels like one of the Instagram-able items you take along on your hike, just so that you can post a photo of you sitting like at home, just in nature. For the ‘gram, and not because it is more enjoyable.</p>

<p>And maybe that is my main problem - that people try to make nature feel more like home. I go outdoors to be away from home, experience the fresh wind on my face, hear the birds singing, feel the soft ground under my feet. The last thing on my mind, since I go actively outdoors since a dozen or so years again, is a chair. If along the trail there’s a nice bench with a good view, sure, I sit down on it, take a gulp of water and maybe some nuts, and then I continue. At camp I sit not that much, either. I move all the time, to get water, make fire or cook food, pitch the tarp and change into dry socks and clothes. I sit so little at camp, that carrying a comfort item like a hiking chair or stool into nature feels so utterly unnecessary to me, that I wonder if other people sit for hours in camp? After a day of hiking, once I have ate and took the last photos of the day, I am happy to simply lay down under my quilt, and fall asleep.</p>

<p><em>Do I have it all wrong?</em> Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/">Facebook</a> if I should try a hiking chair or stool, and give my arse the comfort it deserves after a day on the trail 😃</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Content Creators, Photographers and Small- and Medium-Sized Businesses suffer a lot under the current Corona Virus Pandemic. Here are my tips on how you can help them during these difficult times.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49716642567/in/dateposted-public/" title="The Start"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49716642567_15d2daaa60_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Start" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>While governments across the globe sign “Rescue Packages” into law, these millions and billions of €£$ do not end up in the hands of the people who most suffer from this loss of income. Nope, it goes to large, multinational firms and you, me and my entrepreneur colleagues, we still sit in front of a hill of invoices which want to be paid - and then there’s the thing with rent for the flat and food.</p>

<p><em>BUT</em> there are ways you can support your favourite local shops, Youtube channels and outdoor blogs: Use their Affiliate Links when you shop. Because lets realize: Those of us who are fortunate enough to be able to <em>work from home</em> still have an income, and might need to buy some things to make life at home more bearable, or you simply have enough time now to ponder which backpack to purchase for that next trip when we are allowed to go out again! So if there is an online content creator you really enjoy, support her or him! Check their affiliate links from their content, even ask them for them if you don’t find them and then click on them before you order something online. And if they have a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">Patreon</a>, maybe check it out and see if you can support them with a few €$£ every month.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49716327811/in/dateposted-public/" title="Dusk"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49716327811_0353c656f1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dusk" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With local entrepreneurs &amp; shops you could either purchase things from their online shops or call in and order the things you need for take-away. Many Café’s, restaurants and small shops offer this service during this crisis, and it helps them to survive in these times where everything which is not an essential business has to shut down and close their doors. Especially those entrepreneurs which need to pay rent for their shop are having a lot of stress and sorrow, as they could lose their businesses if they are not able to pay the rent. I really hope that there are many rent lords who will not collect rent in these times, and let normal people and businesses not end up on the street.</p>

<p>As for travel businesses like Hostels, Hotels and Tour Operators - and I have many friends who operate such businesses and I can tell you that they are severely affected - you could book a trip or reserve a room for when this Pandemic is set to calm down. If you’re optimistic that could be for the autumn, in September or October, or if you think this Pandemic will last longer, then maybe for next winter or spring. As I was just up North I can tell you that the <a href="https://sevenfellshostel.fi">7 Fells Hostel</a>, the <a href="https://hetan-majatalo.fi">Hetan Majatalo</a> and the <a href="https://www.yllaslodge.com">Ylläs Lodge</a> really would appreciate your support during this time, as are my friends from <a href="https://adventurepartners.fi">Adventure Partners</a>, <a href="https://blissadventure.fi/">Bliss Adventures</a> and <a href="https://www.outdoorpassion.fi">Outdoor Passion Finland</a>.</p>

<p>If you were planning to attend a <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Kurse-und-Touren:::21.html?MODsid=99c87c38cddd237c6eed6767d3a35265">packrafting</a>, <a href="https://andrewskurka.com/guided-trips/">backpacking</a> or <a href="http://www.davidlintern.com/tuition-scotland">photography course</a> which got post-poned or cancelled, book a course to a later date - either in the autumn or next spring. Because: Looking forward to your next trip is definitely something which is a positive thing in your life right now! And to be inspired for your next trip, why not <a href="https://shop.kelsey.co.uk/subscription/TGO?promo=TGO">take out a subscription</a> of your <a href="https://sidetracked.bigcartel.com/product/sidetracked-subscription-issue-17-18-19">favourite outdoor magazine</a>?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://awesome-maps.com?ref=5bf3c25a56dc2" title="Awesome Maps made my Man Cave prettier!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49741624443_b3b9ca2e90_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Awesome Maps made my Man Cave prettier!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Don’t want to go to the shop to buy stuff? With the <a href="http://bit.ly/2L5feSO">ANYCUBIC PHOTON S 3D Printer</a> you can print your own items (linelocs, <a href="http://instagram.com/skullsandpaints/">miniatures</a> and tent stakes come to mind).</p>

<p>And now lets look at some of my favourite brands and their online offerings!</p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/2ORYUpk">Black Diamond</a> makes my favourite Windjacket, the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Alpine Start Hoody</a>, and they just launched a new line of approach shoes which are really good for hiking in the mountains, too.</p>

<p>Talking of shoes, <a href="https://www.lunasandals.com?rfsn=35669.8168e">Luna Sandals</a> makes my favourite sandals, the Luna OSO (Flaco). They even have a special Edition of that shoe available right now, if you like it colourful!</p>

<p>If I’m not wearing Sandals then you will find <a href="https://bit.ly/3dT91WV">La Sportiva</a> shoes on my feet. I’m a La Sportiva Ambassador since several years and am really happy to have these fantastic shoes and ski boots on my feet during my adventures, like the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/la-sportiva-crossover-2-dot-0-gtx.html">La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX</a>.</p>

<p>I’m also a huge <a href="http://bit.ly/2qV5lwl">Patagonia</a> fan as the brand makes sustainable, durable and high-quality outdoor apparel and gear, while also taking care of the environment and its employees. A brand definitely worth supporting during these times.</p>

<p>If you’re still in need of a ultralight backpack, take a look at what <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de">HUCKEPACKS</a> has to offer. The PHOENIX Lite is currently my favourite backpack, and the new <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/specials/beipack-special/">BEI Pack</a> is a really cool looking fanny pack! This small cottage definitely needs your support right now, so if you can support them - DO IT!</p>

<p>And finally, as a Houdini Friend you won’t be too surprised that I recommend their apparel, too. <a href="http://houdinisportswear.com/">Houdini Sportwear</a> is with a few exemptions pretty much all I wear - right now for example my pants, shirt and fleece jacket are from them, and it are garments that I wear day-in, day-out, at home, in the city and outdoors. All Houdini garments this season are <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/en-eu/sustainability/sustainability-status-100">100% recycled, recyclable, renewable, biodegradable or Bluesign certified</a> and I love their simple aesthetic and functional cuts.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago I wrote about <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/hiking-and-travel-during-covid-19.html">Hiking and Travel during COVID-19</a>, and now I’m back and want to share my experiences with you of how it was to travel in this time and age. In case you wonder: Yes, <strong>this was a work trip</strong>. I went on this trip because it means I can put food on the table for April and May. It is the only larger income for the foreseeable future, and yes, my family and me were discussing long and in-depth if I should go. Deep inside I probably hoped that OnniBus would just cancel the journey to Levi, then I’d be able to easily postpone the trip. But I kept on checking their website, and on the evening of the 19th of March it was clear: My Bus to Lapland rides, and my buses south too. So I put the last things into my Pulka, strapped the skis on top, filled up my Thermos with hot juice and went to the Bus Station.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49720079711/in/dateposted-public/" title="COVID-19 Bus Selfie"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49720079711_1ecf6aedb0_b.jpg" width="769" height="1024" alt="COVID-19 Bus Selfie" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My Bus from Vaasa left at 2:30 in the middle of the night, and with me were another five or six people on the bus - all well spaced out. I put on my <a href="https://amzn.to/3dEOEN7">noise-cancelling headphones</a>, put the relaxing sound of a rainy night playing, and fell asleep. I awoke at 7:00 in the morning in Oulu, where I had an hour time before my Bus to Levi would leave. The sun was shining outside, it was -7°C and inside in the waiting hall of the bus station were four other people. Everyone was sitting on his or her own bench, with several meters of distance between us. As I was going to sit another 9 hours in the Bus I pulled my Pulka to the bus platform and started walking up and down in the sun.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49719505363/in/dateposted-public/" title="Oulu Matkakeskus"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49719505363_34eacd27c9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Oulu Matkakeskus" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the Bus to Levi we were a few more people - maybe between ten and twelve. Again there were several rows distance between each passenger, and at the few longer stops everyone let the others disembark with a lot of distance. People stayed away from each other, and no one was wearing face-masks. As we reached the border with Sweden after Kemi you could see the border guards stoping cars which tried to pass between Finland and Sweden, something I have not seen ever before.</p>

<p>As I arrived in Levi I was surprised about the bustle in town. The lifts were operating, people were out skiing, fatbiking, and going for a stroll in the beautiful sunny weather. I waited 10 Minutes for my Bus for Hetta, and we were a total of three passengers on this Bus. Then, finally, at almost 17 o’clock I had arrived in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/04/hetta-winter-adventures-in-finnish-lapland.html">Hetta</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49715782283/in/dateposted-public/" title="Hetan Majatalo"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49715782283_ed3bc81a4a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hetan Majatalo" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This part of the journey worked surprisingly well. I was happy to be in sunny Lapland, with cold and sunny weather in the forecast. I was looking forward to go <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/impressions-from-the-hetta-pallas-hiking-trail.html">skiing on the Hetta - Pallas Trail</a>, and leave this crazy situation behind me for a while at least.</p>

<p>The next morning I left Hetta, and loved skiing on the XC tracks. It was exhausting, but the sun was shining, there was little wind, and the views were great. My phone was in Airplane mode, both so it preserved battery and that I’m not bothered by what is going on elsewhere on this planet 🌍. For the next days I had a wonderful time (being happily ignorant of developments in Finland and elsewhere) although it also has been <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-XgJhSDDOy/">utterly exhausting</a> at times.</p>

<p>On Tuesday I arrived at the rustic Montellin Maja hut, and thought it would be a good time to check my Emails. That’s where the stress started: I had several messages from OnniBus that they decided to cancel all Ski Busses from Levi &amp; Ylläs to the south, BUT there was one Bus still going - you needed to be in touch if you wanted to get a seat on it. A few stressful hours ensued, while I was skiing in windy &amp; sunny weather first to the large Nammalakuru Hut and then onwards to the Rihmakuru Kota. As I arrived at the latter I had received a reply that I was rebooked on the Bus on Saturday morning going south, and so I could enjoy this wonderful Kota with it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel/status/1242769710699159552">amazing tiny stove</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49715787928/in/dateposted-public/" title="Hannunkuru Sauna"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49715787928_ac3c16c7a9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hannunkuru Sauna" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The next few days I spent skiing and fatbiking in Ylläs while enjoying the hospitality of the <a href="https://sevenfellshostel.fi/">7 Fells Hostel</a>. On Saturday morning I took a Taxi to the Bus Stop, and was happy to see that there were a few more travellers making the journey south. That meant at least the bus was not cancelled. <em>Or that’s what we thought.</em> It was 10:20 and there was no Bus in sight. 10:30, still no Bus. 10:40, no Bus. A Blizzard was raging at the Bus Stop, and it was cold. We were wondering with the other passengers what is going on - it’s just a short 16 km to Levi, and such a delay seemed very strange. Was the Bus coming?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49720358282/in/dateposted-public/" title="Ylläs OnniBus Stop"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49720358282_d639ceb6d0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Ylläs OnniBus Stop" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At 11:20, an hour late, the OnniBus rolled to the Bus Stop. Everyone was reliefed and smiling - we would get home at last! We loaded all our stuff inside, and off we were. There still was lots of space - the next passengers to me sat three rows behind me - and somehow we also arrived not too late in Oulu. I saw the train going to Seinäjoki stand already at the platform, and decided to try to catch it, even if I only had a ticket for Sunday night on the same train. I got in, stored all my stuff, and sat down alone as the only passenger in the whole waggon. My ticket was accepted with a smile and several hours later I disembarked in Seinäjoki. I waited a short while alone on the platform while Dusk was painting the sky in beautiful hues of orange, red and blue, till my train to Vaasa arrived. The same thing again - I was the only passenger in the whole waggon, and had a friendly chat with the conductress. I arrived well back in Vaasa at home, kissed my kids good night after over a week, and had a relaxed evening with my wife. But <strong>I wouldn’t go on such a trip again under these circumstances.</strong></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49720326892/in/dateposted-public/" title="Seinäjoki Railway Station"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49720326892_663093297c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Seinäjoki Railway Station" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>What would have been a fabulous trip and an amazing experience under normal circumstances warped into a stressful and uncertain trip during this COVID-19 Pandemic. Being reliant on Public Transportation in these times is highly unreliable, and adds a level of stress which I wouldn’t want to experience when I go on a trip. Being uncertain about if you get home, or when and how, just distracts from your enjoyment of the nature and landscape you went to explore &amp; experience. As the COVID-19 Pandemic is set to limit travels (in Finland) at least till the end of May I know that I will not go anywhere where I can not get on my bike from the front of my house, or where I can hike or paddle easily.</p>

<p>Going outdoors is a place for me where I want to be able to recuperate, and even if I can stay offline and shut out the rest of the world, if you need to get home with the bus or train afterwards that thought will stick with you, even as your phone stays in Flight Mode. So my conclusion is simple: Travelling during the COVID-19 pandemic, even within your own country - is not worth it. Stay local, explore your own backyard forests and lakes, and use your bike, feet and <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Neu/Anfibio-Rebel-2K::889.html">packraft</a> to get to new places. The hills will still be there when this Pandemic has passed, and you will enjoy them a lot more than now, in these uncertain times. And why not <a href="http://tidd.ly/f2bcba3e">camp in the garden this Eastern</a> instead of travelling far?</p>
