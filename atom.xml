<p>It was with great sadness that I heard last Sunday about the death of Ueli Steck, an Alpinist &amp; Mountaineer I greatly looked up to. I was fortunate enough to meet Ueli several times throughout the last four years, and it all started with this <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/08/ueli-steck-interview.html">video interview</a> with him. He was a warm, friendly person and I always enjoyed chatting with him, about Finland, Switzerland, alpinism and climbing. I sincerely wish his wife and family much love &amp; strength in this time of mourning.</p>

<p>And the Bergfreunde have the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/marken/la-sportiva/?pid=10239">newest La Sportiva Gear</a> in stock - get a new pair of trailrunning or climbing shoes or the discounted <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/la-sportiva-spectre-20-tourenskischuhe/?pid=10239">Spectre 2.0</a>, my current ski-touring boot!</p>

<p>Like any good movie also <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/the-week-in-review/">The Week In Review</a> makes a return to your screens. Many of you have reached out to me and asked me to start to write the TWIR again, and after much thinking I decided to dust the good old TWIR off again and take it out of retirement. I hope it will get better and that you still will like it as much as previously, and that together we can make this the best resource for finding out about excellent content from the outdoors - be it backpacking, paddling &amp; packrafting or bikepacking and climbing. <em>And no, this is not an April’s Fool Joke.</em></p>

<p>I’m all about protecting the wild spaces which we need to enjoy our outdoor hobbies. Podcasts are a great way to learn while you cycle or commute to work, or while packing your gear for a outing. Listen to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thedirtbagdiaries/endangered-spaces-bears-ears">Endangered Spaces: Bears Ears</a>. Also the <a href="http://mountainpodcast.com">Mountain Podcast</a> is always worth a listen, so check it out if you haven’t yet!</p>

<p>And related to that is the monumental decision of the <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/opinion/4955043-155/editorial-the-world-is-not-so">Outdoor Retailer leaving Utah</a> for its government’s anti-environmental decisions.

And as it just dumped some 30 cm of snow and the winter holidays start here in Pohjanmaa it is time to shed some light on the Reimatec Stavanger Overall and why we love it!</p>

<p>Last December the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Lasten-ulkovaatteet/Lasten-haalarit-ja-setit/Lasten-Reimatec®%2B-toppahaalari-Stavanger/p/520190F-8430">Reimatec Stavanger Overall</a> arrived at the Hiking in Finland HQ and was immediately declared awesome by our son and very relieved parents (because they in a moment no longer needed to help dressing him up =). To understand this one needs to know that our son always needed a little assistance when he needed to put on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/11/winter-fun-with-the-reima-mamid-jacket-and-procyon-pants.html">Jacket and Pants</a> when it was time to go out. While he could put them on himself he prefrred to that mom or dad help him get dressed for the cold. As we have a one year old who can’t yet dress herself up this meant we were at once dressing up two kids, plus ourselves, before we could go out. This can get tedious to say the least, so when we saw that he was happy to put on the overall (in less than a minute, including <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Asusteet/Pipot-ja-hatut/c/k61">hat</a>, <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/brands/buff/for--kids/?pid=10239">Buff</a> and the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Asusteet/Hanskat-ja-rukkaset/Talvirukkaset-ja--hanskat/c/k63">Reimatec Suunta mitts</a>) we were very happy parents indeed!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32988261492/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3853/32988261492_093feeba9b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>So, now the kid has dressed himself up to go out into the cold, but how does the overall stand up to the use &amp; abuse a 5 year old can throw at it? Very well, we’d say. We were ice skating, building igloos, climbing on rocks, had running competitions and played hide &amp; seek, in temperatures from 0°C to -20°C. The waterproof &amp; breathable outer shell material has taken all these activities in stride and hasn’t failed us yet, keeping wind, snow and wetness at bay. It’s pretty durable, too - climbing on rocks with the knees and then sliding them back down hasn’t done any damage to the material.</p>

<p>It’s easy to clean, too - just throw it into the washing machine (add a suitable <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/toko-eco-softshell-wash-250-ml-detergent/?pid=10239">detergent</a>) at 40°C and an hour later you can hang it up to dry. Because of the insulation it needs around 12 to 16 hours to thoroughly dry, so keep that in mind.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32329153543/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2937/32329153543_c4ea0971cb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Warmth-wise the overall is toasty and is sufficient on its own up to temperatures of -5°C with our son. When it gets colder than -5°C we add a <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Koululaisten-lastenvaatteet/Lasten-lämpökerrastot/Yläosat/Lasten-fleecetakki-Frans/p/536097-3710">fleece jacket</a> and <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Lasten-sisävaatteet/Alaosat/Lasten-fleecehousut-Argelius/p/526243-6980">fleece pants</a> underneath the overall, and that’s no problem as there’s room to spare without restricting movement. Speaking of movement, snow angles, climbing on rocks and at the play ground, skiing and ice skating all were easy to do as the overall does not restrict the freedom of movement.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32761950190/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/601/32761950190_525fece769_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Also otherwise we really like the Stavanger Overall: The inside suspenders are great when dressing up and in breaks as our son can undress the overall but with the suspenders still over his shoulders he’s able to walk around without that the top is hanging on the floor. The width of the overall can be adjusted via two inside elastics, making it as wide or narrow as you need it. There’s only two pockets on it which is just the right amount, and the insulated hood with a fur collar can be removed (the fake fur, too). The leg cuffs can also be adjusted in width, while the elastic cuffs keep wind and snow from getting into the sleeves. The reflective details are easy to overlook, but there’s plenty of them, from top to bottom, which makes the wearer very visible on these dark winter nights and morning.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32761950830/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/746/32761950830_918aa8078a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Some words on the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Koululaisten-lastenvaatteet/Asusteet/Hanskat-ja-rukkaset/Lasten-Reimatec®%2B--topparukkaset-Suunta/p/527252-9990">Reimatec Suunta mitts</a>, too. We got these at the same time than the overall but they haven’t been used as much - simply because it was way too warm for them most of this <em>“winter”</em>. Now that the thermometer has shown beautiful double digit minus degrees it was time to put them on, and for playing in the snow and walking to the kindergarden or to town these were great to keep the little hands warm. These mitts have a very warm fleece lining and a snug cuff which goes high, and they’re best from temperatures over -10°C in our experience. Anything above that and our son would run very hot &amp; sweaty in them. Because they’re so long it’s best to put the gloves on before the overall, this is simpler. There’s some help needed to get the hands in the gloves through the elastic cuffs of the overall, but compared with dressing a kid up completely it’s a minor thing!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32761952150/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3929/32761952150_1a2e9a9ff8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that with the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Lasten-ulkovaatteet/Lasten-haalarit-ja-setit/Lasten-Reimatec®%2B-toppahaalari-Stavanger/p/520190F-8430">Reimatec Stavanger Overall</a> we have a happy son that can dress up alone at home &amp; in the kindergarden, allows him to play outside in the cold winter weather, be visible in the mornings and evenings when it gets dark, and it is easy to undress when going inside for a hot chocolate! A happy son of course means also happy parents, so the Stavanger gets from us six thumbs up! It’s a very durable and well-designed kids overall and we just hope our daughter will be fine with the green colour once she is big enough to wear it in some three years =)</p>

<h2 id="im-an-ambassador">I’m an Ambassador³</h2>

<p>Well, actually that should be a four I reckon - because I’m already a <a href="http://www.helsport.no/hendrik-morkel">Helsport Ambassador</a> since last year. But I met with three companies which I really value and like a lot, and we had great discussion on how to work together in 2017 and onwards. Once contracts are signed I’ll announce it, but for now I can tease you that they’re brands you already have seen quite a bit here on the blog!</p>

<h2 id="new-gear">New Gear</h2>

<p>Is this the most important section? Could be. It’s also the section which takes a lot of work and hence I will postpone this to another time when I have more time.</p>

<h2 id="greenpeace-x-gore-tex-x-sympatex">Greenpeace x Gore-Tex x Sympatex</h2>

<p><a href="http://sympatex.com">Sympatex</a> is already since last year working on a much more environmentally friendly membrane technology which is free of dangerous substances - and at the ISPO it launched its <em>“guaranteed green” Sympatex membrane, which is produced in a completely climate-neutral way for the first time. In order to eliminate any contribution to global warming, the ecological alternative among functional textile specialists will compensate the CO2 amount of its entire yearly membrane production starting from 2017 through respective climate protection certificates in cooperation with the Munich-based consultancy ClimatePartner. Thus, Sympatex can compensate even the last remaining CO2 emissions that are released during the production of the membrane with the support of internationally certified climate protection projects.</em> I already tweeted about this last year and am super-excited about this development, it’s a big step into the right direction. Add in that the Sympatex membrane is PFC free and is used by very environmentally conscious companies like Vaude and you know that this is a great shell membrane.</p>

<p>But Sympatex is sadly just a smaller player when it comes to membranes - it’s the giants which one needs to convince to become better. And while you may think of Greenpeace what you’d like, they managed to convince the giant to make amends and move into the right direction. Gore Fabrics will <em>eliminate PFCs of Environmental Concern from its general outdoor weatherproofing laminates (corresponding to 85% of products made with these laminates) by the end of 2020 and from its specialized weatherproofing laminates (corresponding to the remaining 15% of products made with these laminates) by the end of 2023. The company will develop new, more environmentally friendly technologies for weatherproof membranes and water repellent coatings for consumer products, researching both fluorine-free and fluorinated options, and publicly document that no hazardous PFCs are released into the environment throughout the product lifecycle.</em></p>

<p>So after two years of campaigning for <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/PFC-Revolution/">Detox Outdoor</a> we finally have convinced Gore-Tex that it is time to do something better - even if with Sympatex, Páramo &amp; Nikwax (see underneath) there are already PFC-free options available. But as most people have likely never heard of Sympatex and a hardshell is for them a Gore-Tex Jacket, it’s a great sign that <em>Gore Fabrics is excited about the opportunity to drive meaningful change in the outdoor industry by making a very significant investment in developing new technologies that are free of PFCs of Environmental Concern.</em> If you are curious about Gore’s Roadmap to go PFC free, <a href="http://www.gore-tex.com/en-us/experience/responsibility/environmental/fluorochemicals">have a look here</a>. Wondering what’s the raucous about PFC in the first place? Have a <a href="http://www.dw.com/de/bald-weniger-gift-in-outdoor-kleidung/a-37433778">look at this article</a> [in German] and if you want to know which brands offer PFC-free garments, <a href="https://www.greenpeace.de/presse/publikationen/factsheet-outdoor-branche-ohne-gefaehrliche-pfc">take a look at this pdf</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pramo-press-conference">Páramo Press Conference</h2>

<p>I try to avoid Press Conferences because, as Björn writes in his excellent <a href="https://st-bergweh.de/2017/02/10/ispo-2017-highlight-die-traenen-von-paramo/">Páramo Press Conference article</a>, they’re 97% useless for my work. Happily for us the Páramo Press conferences belongs the 1% which are fantastic, and hence I highly recommend that you direct your browser towards Björn’s great article and read the whole story about how Páramo’s partner, the Miquelina Foundation, became a member of the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) which means that Páramo garments are now Fair Trade verified - and not just that, it’s the first outdoor brand in the whole market which can use the <a href="http://wfto.com/standard-and-guarantee-system/our-product-label">WFTO First-Buyer Label</a>. Add in that Páramo garments are PFC-free, long-lasting and can easily be re-proofed with Nikwax products and you have a real winner =)</p>

<h2 id="scandal">Scandal!</h2>

<p>And then there was that small scandal right before the ISPO kicked off. A fellow blogger, Andreas from Gipfelfieber, <a href="http://gipfelfieber.com/2017/02/03/was-kostet-eigentlich-ein-ispo-award-und-laesst-der-sich-sogar-kaufen/">published an article</a> which asked <em>“Can an ISPO Award be bought?”</em>. Well, basically you need to pay either way an entry fee to compete in the Award, so the short answer is yes. The long answer, and which was written about in an <em>could-be-the-case-but-we-can’t-proof-it</em> style suggested that a Jury member offered an ISPO Award entry company the possibility to buy an award. Sadly the article can not deliver any real evidence that this is really the case and as long as this evidence is missing it is an accusation which I wouldn’t take too serious.</p>

<p>Sometime last autumn I purchased a new domain. My mind is set, I need a fresh start. After eight years of blogging at Hiking in Finland I need a new challenge. It’s a bad time to do this, but if I don’t do it not now I never might. Hiking in Finland is the most-read English-language blog from Scandinavia, there’s over 30.000 Regular Readers a month, add in the close to 20.000 Followers and Fans on the different Social Media channels and you can understand the dilemma of changing something that’s so successful and generates part of my income (Yes, I work full time on the blog since 2014).</p>

<p>Things that led to this is that I do far more nowadays than hiking in Finland - just last year I was ski-touring in Norway &amp; Switzerland, on adventure travel trips in Macedonia, Greece and Mexico, on active family holidays in Vorarlberg, backpacking in South Tyrol and cycle touring in Finland. So the name is out-dated and limits me, but I also moved away a bit from what this blog was about in the beginning - ultralight backpacking. While I maintain that Ultralight is Not Dead I also have started to look over the borders - I have entered a partnership with Helsport for example, and while I always try to carry as little as possible and use the lightest gear for the occasion it’s not the be all and end all of all things like it was more in the past.</p>

<p>But mostly I feel I have become complacent. The status quo is a dangerous place to get lazy and before other’s think <em>It’s the same old</em> I myself might just kill the status quo, reinvent and embark on a new journey. It might be rough on the edges at the beginning, some of you might not like it, but I am sure that with a new challenge I am able to grow myself and the blog to a new level that’s more creative &amp; honest.</p>

<h2 id="design-or-why-does-hif-look-not-like-it-used-to">DESIGN or why does HiF look not like it used to?</h2>
<p>Last November I managed to destroy the backend of Hiking in Finland - right before the #HiFAdventCalendar should have started and while I was in Mexico. Some bacteria or virus knocked me out for two weeks once I returned from Mexico and I barely was able to publish the daily doors on the ad-hoc blog I created. As I got healthy again I had a big hacking session and managed to get HiF back online the way you see it now - still not really how it used to look like or how I would like it to look, but better than a 404. During February and March I will try to update the layout and looks, but first there’s some other priorities.</p>

<h2 id="yeps-theres-gonna-be-a-new-blog">Yeps, there’s gonna be a new blog</h2>
<p>Hiking in Finland will continue &amp; will be regularly updated in the future, but my new website Hike Climb Travel will see a lot more action. Hike Climb Travel is much broader in name as Hiking in Finland and reflects that I do much more than hiking &amp; backpacking in Finland. Hiking in Finland will be home to my adventures at home and neighbouring countries, while Hike Climb Travel will be my outlet for everything that does take place outside of my beautiful home country. It will kick off some time in February, with a pretty, responsive layout, a great brand identity and some great stories to get you hooked. The best way to stay informed about when the new blog goes online is to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.us2.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=b29c2acd04d959eace48da780&amp;id=46b5d0326f">subscribe to the Newsletter</a> and follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hendrikmorkel">Youtube</a>, but no worries, I also will let it be known here.</p>

<p>For some time I will try to work on both blogs, but time will show if that is possible &amp; smart or if I just move everything over to the new website. Thus, if there’s a favourite article here on the Olde Blog, now is a good time to save it as a pdf for future references. Some content will will also be moved over, so no worries that it’s gonna be all lost down the aether.</p>

<h2 id="twir-is-not-dead">TWIR is (Not?) Dead</h2>
<p>A couple of weeks back I asked on Instagram and Facebook for one reason why you follow me and a large part of the answers included TWIR. But a lot has changed since I started The Week In Review six years ago: I got married, have two wonderful kids and a house that still needs a wee bit of renovation (not to mention the garden). I feel I have neglected my family the last years every Sunday for several hours while writing the TWIR, and with a little daughter of one year I (maybe too late) realised it is time to kill The Week in Review, reclaim my Sundays and spend them with the people that matter the most to me - my wife and kids.</p>

<p>Also, The Week In Review is a popular post but it never generated much of income for me. I tried to monetise it in some tasteful ways by affiliate links to offers that matter to you, and a couple of times the Packrafting Store sponsored an issue, but these were not putting enough €$£ into my pocket for the time I invest into the TWIR. Because I know that so many of you love the TWIR and rely on it to find new, relevant content that matters, I am open to suggestions on how we could keep the Week In Review alive - but it would be published then on Mondays as I want to have a weekend. Maybe a PayPal subscription would be an option, but that would mean some of you would need to start to pay for the TWIR content. If you think that’s something you’d be willing to do, leave a comment underneath - and also other ideas and feedback is welcome.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31674881554/in/dateposted/" title="Ice River floating"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/700/31674881554_9d690dd7bb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ice River floating" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>All in all I am very happy to have this off my chest. I felt bad leaving you loyal readers in the dark about this since last December, but now that I typed it down and re-read it a couple of times it feels good and I am happy to hit publish and see how you take these changes. Thus, comment away - here or on the Social Media channels you can find me on!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>I really missed talking to you. Twelve months is a long time of radio-silence, and I have a lot to tell you. Like all the awesome trips I have been on this year, from <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/05/lyngen.html">Ski-touring in Lyngen</a> to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/autumn-backpacking-in-the-dolomites.html">backpacking in the Dolomites</a>, 2016 has been fantastic. I spent great moments <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-the-bregenzerwald.html">with my family in the mountains</a>, and am looking very much forward to winter backpacking and other adventures.</p>

<p>But lets get down to business and start talking about the holiday season and the awesome <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/advent-calendar-2016/">Hiking in Finland Advent Calendar</a>. I saw it was again very nicely filled with prizes worth over 5.000€, and what better way to celebrate an awesome #HiFAdventCalendar season than with a sweet ADZHiFASO package from some small companies!</p>

<p><a href="https://whoopieslings.com/">whoopieslings.com</a> make a complete Hammock and Tarp Suspension Systems, and as I decided to give hammocks another chance what would be better than having a smart suspension system for it? A set of 6” whoopie slings, a pair of 6’ tree huggers and a pair of toggles should make setting up my hammock a breeze!</p>

<p>Similar to hammocking I think it is time to step up my trailrunning again! A <a href="http://www.ks-ultralightgear.com/p/blog-page_13.html">VRV8 Pack</a> from KS ultralight gear would be ideal for that - the pack is super simple yet efficient and packs all I need for a day out running in the forests and hills. It carries my poles, soft flasks or water bottles, and 8 l of gear fit into the main compartment, all with restricting movement.</p>

<p>One thing I have learned which should always be along is a pair of rain mitts. The <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=37&amp;products_id=51">Mountain Laurel Design eVent Rain Mitts</a> are the lightest rain mitts on the market and rumour has it that if one carries a pair rain usually doesn’t bother one when outside, so they’re kind of a good charm, too!</p>

<p>Also a pair of <a href="https://goosefeetgear.com/products/1-down-socks">GooseFeet Gear Down Socks</a> have been on my list for a long time - not just because I get awfully could feet at camp in winter, but also because they pack so tiny &amp; light when I’m hiking throughout the day. Filled with 850 fill power DownTek down these socks keep me toasty on my winter adventures, which is especially great after a long day in boots!</p>

<p>And finally, a <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/32-oz-wide-bottle#92=20">32 oz Wide Mouth Bottle</a> from Hydro Flask would be swell - not just for plenty of coffee the whole day but also for keeping drinks cold in the heat. It is BPA-Free, Toxin-Free and comes with a Lifetime Warranty - so this would be the last bottle I’d ever ask for!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>also for freeriding and ski-touring lighter means better: A lighter ski, boot and backpack allows you to skin up in more comfort &amp; faster, while at the same time preserving energy for the ride down. <a href="https://www.mammut.ch/">Mammut</a> updated their <a href="https://www.mammut.ch/INT/en/B2C-Kategorie/Skiing-Boarding/Ride-Removable-Airbag-3-0/p/2610-01250-0001-1030">Ride Removable Airbag 3.0 Backpack</a> which got even lighter this year, with the Removable Airbag System 3.0 getting even more compact &amp; dependable while remaining just as removable and transferable to other compatible packs as before. The airbag system itself is just 690 g and with a carbon cartridge it tips the scales at barely over 1 kg. The 30l backpack on the other hand fits enough gear for a long day in the mountains, with a front pocket for avalanche safety equipment &amp; a padded google pocket, it carries skis or a snowboard and an integrated helmet carrier carries the helmet when skinning up, too. All in all it’s a might fine pack and Airbag System that helps to keep me safe during deep powder days where the avalanche risk is high! Now lets hope that this winter is going to be better than the last one!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>you know what I like (you probably do by now =)? Small companies which make innovative gear. <a href="http://www.paramo-clothing.de/">Páramo</a> is such a company, which not only designs &amp; makes great garments for outdoor activities, they also do good and foster ethical &amp; sustainable production. Take their <a href="">Enduro Jacket</a> for example, which is made from their directional Nikwax Analogy Waterproof fabric. It is Made in Colombia, is 100% PFC Free, at the end of its long life it can be recycled via the Páramo Recycling Scheme and the company helps to fund conservation projects across the globe. That’s a lot of good things a single jacket can do for people, planet and the one wearing it. Made for the mountains the Enduro can accompany one ski-touring and alpine climbing with its great freedom of movement, while the many pockets keep important kit close at hand. The large peak on the helmet-compatible hood keeps snow and rain at bay, and large arm vents help to stay cool when skinning up a mountain. And after a long season of use &amp; fun it can be made like new again by washing it with Nikwax products! Yeps, that are exactly the kind of things I like and wish there would be more from!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rutalocura.com/">Ruta Locura</a> is one of those small cottages which know their trade and their ultralight materials, in in their case that’s carbon fibre. Josh has been building since the mid-2000s carbon fibre and titanium goods for ultralight backpackers, campers, fishermen and hunters alike, and their <a href="http://www.rutalocura.com/trekking_poles.html">Yana Trekking Poles</a> are some of the most versatile poles on the market. Not just are they great to pitch Pyramid shelters and tarps at the end of the day, they also can be transformed into a tenkara rod when you want to add some trout to the Menu in the evening! The poles are also light, as you would expect, and so durable that a pair should last with some proper care and maintenance at least half a lite time!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Winter is also the time for wearing toasty warm down jackets. But down does not equal down, and hence we as consumers need to sometimes steer companies into the right direction. One company which doesn’t need steering but is leading in responsibly manufactured down is <a href="http://www.mountain-equipment.de">Mountain Equipment</a> with their <a href="http://www.thedowncodex.co.uk">Down Codex</a>. Since many years they offer customers the ability to 100% trace the down in their sleeping bags and jackets, which means one can have peace of mind in knowing that the down which keeps one warm was gathered with animal welfare in mind. So back to that toasty jacket I mentioned: With winters being warmer in the last few years a jacket like the <a href="http://www.mountain-equipment.de/arete-hooded-jacket">Men’s Arete Hooded Jacket</a> is ideal for the temperatures one encounters in our winters. The 320 g light jacket comes with two zippered pockets for cold hands &amp; camera batteries, and the hood ensures also ears and neck don’t need to freeze. Best of all: The water-resistant down doesn’t collapse when the snow turns to slush, and with some smart layering one could use this down jacket all year around!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blackrockgear.com">Black Rock Gear</a> hails from Seattle, Washington, that city which is known for Nirvana, Rain, Starbucks and the Space Needle, and it’s location between Puget Sound and the Cascade Mountain range makes it a great location for outdoor enthusiasts. It’s thus no surprise that Black Rock Gear makes some of the finest &amp; lightest <a href="https://www.blackrockgear.com/gear/">Down Hats</a> available for outdoor enthusiasts around the globe. Take The Original Beanie for example, which was an instant classic when it launched several years ago. Filled with 950 fill power goose down and sewn with ultralight ripstop nylon it’s so light, you sometimes only realize it’s on your head because your ears are toasty! Also the <a href="https://www.blackrockgear.com/product/the-brg-sport-pack/">BRG Sport Pack</a> is a light daypack made from durable materials which is excellent for those Urban adventures one goes on. It’s water-proof zippers keeps the inside dry, and the two internal Mesh “Catch All” Pockets help with organzing on the go. The pack can be fully opened for easy packing and access, and the padded shoulder straps make it comfortable to carry all day long!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Quilts are what we ultralight backpackers &amp; climbers love most. Not only are they way lighter than a sleeping bag, but the freedom of movement and ease of use are at least as important. <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/">Enlightened Equipment</a> makes some of the most innovative <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/quilts/">quilts</a> on the market, and almost all of their quilts are Made-to-Order exactly like one wants it. Extra down and a slim cut? No problem! Synthetic insulation and a wide foot box? Also no problem! Tim and his employees are able to fulfil almost every wish when it comes to quilts, and once you have slept under an Enlightened Equipment Quilt you won’t ever go back to a sleeping bag!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Winter, that’s ski-touring season for me. I love to skin up a lonely mountain with a good friend or two, enjoy a warm cup of tea at the summit before dropping in and enjoying fresh powder &amp; untouched slopes on the way back to the valley. On a trip like this a good-fitting and functional ski-touring backpack is mandatory, and the <a href="http://www.marmot.de/content/en/collection_36&amp;c=892">Backcountry 32 Pack</a> from <a href="http://www.marmot.de/">Marmot</a> ticks those boxes very well. When you need to Bootpack it carries the skis in a A-Frame or diagonally, a Shovel and Probe Pocket give fast access to the essential tools when needed and the ergonomically designed shoulder harness makes the pack comfortably to carry all day long. Add in that it is light and durably made and you have pack that you’re looking forward to to carry when you get early in the morning to climb up a mountain!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>December is the darkest month of the year, when the days get shorter and shorter until the winter solstice. That’s not ideal for being outdoors here up in the north, but that’s where <a href="http://www.suprabeam.com/">Suprabeam</a> comes in: With their <a href="http://www.suprabeam.com/uk/products/v3air">V3air Headlamp</a> and the <a href="http://www.suprabeam.com/uk/products/q3defend">Q3defend Torch</a> we bring light into the December darkness and can pursue our outdoor activities in the bright light of this headlamp and torch! The V3air is just 140 g but boost up to 250 Lumens, enough to shine up to 195 m far. The Q3defend Torch is even more powerful and also very versatile, and also waterproof! With these two lamps the darkness can come, because we’re ready for it!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.icebug.com/">ICEBUG</a> hails from Sweden and if they know one thing then it is how to have good grip on slippery surfaces like ice and snow when you’re out running. The <a href="http://int-shop.icebug.com/springa/40-49/dubbade/anima5-m-bugrip">Anima5 BUGrip</a> is a dream come true for us ultralight backpackers and trailrunners as one shoe tips the scales at 280 g in a Size 7.5! Add in plenty of durable Carbide Tips which will bite into the hardest snow &amp; ice to guarantee great grip as well as the weather shield membrane which is laminated to the backside of the upper textile and which prevents snow, cold air and slush to your feet when conditions are getting rough, and you have a shoe which is made for running in the North from October to April!</p>
