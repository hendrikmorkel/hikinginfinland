Awesome Maps for all your outdoor activities, from hiking and climbing to mountain biking and diving! Why? Because looking at a beautiful map in your home is second only to hiking with a map outdoors!</p>

<h2 id="awesome-maps">Awesome Maps!</h2>

<p>I have written about maps before (a loooong time ago <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/06/waterproof-hiking-maps.html">here</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/04/planning-a-trip-in-the-lake-district.html">here</a>). I ‚ù§Ô∏è Maps. I love looking at them, planning hikes with them, love reliving past trips with them, just folding them back into the original way, that I don‚Äôt love that much (I‚Äôm not so good at that). A map you don‚Äôt need to fold at all are the maps from <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">‚àû Awesome Maps</a> as you should frame them and hang them from your wall to look at. Like my <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/collections/canvas-world-maps/products/mountain-bike-mtb-trails-map-canvas?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">‚àû Mountain biking World Map</a>, which I put up in my man cave. I started to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/active-holidays-in-are-sweden.html">Downhill MTB in √Öre</a> a few years ago and absolutely love the sport, and I found this Awesome Map the prettiest - I love the style, colours and graphics.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49742174521/in/dateposted/" title="Awesome Mountainbiking Maps!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49742174521_25a275edc3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Awesome Mountainbiking Maps!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49741625368/in/dateposted/" title="Awesome Maps, North and Central America"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49741625368_abdebd9648_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Awesome Maps, North and Central America" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49741624818/in/dateposted/" title="Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49741624818_9fa621a91c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But Awesome Maps not only makes this Map - they make (in Germany!) <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/pages/our-maps?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">‚àû a dozen of inspiring outdoor maps</a>. And you don‚Äôt need to get them as a Canvas map either (though I highly recommend them!), the paper maps are just as pretty, more affordable and can also be easily hanged from the wall - either with the <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/products/wooden-oak-poster-hangers?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">‚àû handmade Oak hanging frame</a>, some Blue Tac or you get it framed at your local framing business! The paper maps are made from the good stuff, too: 250 gsm art paper which is acid free and silk coated, and you even can write on them with an whiteboard marker! That‚Äôs perfect if you wanna put a check ‚úÖ behind e.g. the trails you have hiked already!</p>

<h2 id="diy-frame-for-the-canvas-map">DIY Frame for the Canvas Map</h2>

<p>So that‚Äôs the canvas map Awesome Maps sent me, together with the <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/products/custom-made-diy-canvas-wood-frame-kit?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">‚àû DIY Wood Canvas Frame</a>. I wanted the canvas map as it is larger and fits better into my man cave, and I also can hang it easily from the shelves in my man cave, as you hopefully agree üòä And even if you don‚Äôt agree, hanging the canvas map from the shelves means I can hide the things behind it easily!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49742175336/in/dateposted/" title="Assembled the frame myself, which was a nice DIY Project"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49742175336_671f6a922f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Assembled the frame myself, which was a nice DIY Project" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Assembling the DIY Frame was easy: All I needed was a hammer and a canvas stapler, both tools which I owned already. It was a easy 20 minutes task to assemble the frame and staple the canvas to it, and then it was just a question to bring the large map from the living room to the cellar!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49742175451/in/dateposted/" title="Finished Awesome Map!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49742175451_b5b65ccd42_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Finished Awesome Map!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There I used two hooks from my IKEA shelf to hang the map, and <em>Voil√°!</em> I have an awesome map to look at when I‚Äôm painting or packing or planning in my man cave!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49741624443/in/dateposted/" title="Awesome Maps made my Man Cave prettier!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49741624443_b3b9ca2e90_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Awesome Maps made my Man Cave prettier!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="why-super-ultralight">WHY Super Ultralight?</h2>

<p>That questions is probably on a lot of readers minds. While I see more &amp; more lightweight backpacks and shelters when I am out <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/destinations/">backpacking in Finland</a>, there are still lots more people backpacking with heavy 80 l Volume backpacks, hiking on established trails &amp; sleeping in our Open Wilderness Huts. Which begs my question: Why so heavy? As you will see in this article, I own &amp; use UL gear since 10+ years, and yet things have to go broken. Which means ultralight equipment - backpacks, sleeping pads, shelters &amp; tents as well as garments, shoes and quilts - is durable and long-lasting, without being overbuilt.</p>

<p>While my base weight is usually somewhere around 3 to 5 kg, in the summer I do SUL trips as it‚Äôs very enjoyable to not carry the heavy camera and tripod, to leave the large backpack at home and simply to enjoy the small pack which carries everything I need for hiking on a trail on a warm summer day. People have a hard time believing that you can fit everything into a 24 l backpack, but hey - equipment materials have become lighter and can be compressed a lot more nowadays, so it‚Äôs pretty easy, as you can see in the accompanying video underneath. So for me going SUL in the summer is about enjoyment, being more connected to nature and the surrounding environment, while being able to cover longer distances without pain &amp; stress. It simply is fun to be out with a light pack, without sacrificing any comfort or safety. And yes, there‚Äôs also some gear-nerdery going on on such trips, and testing what is possible! <strong>You can view the complete list at the end of the article or <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/z1a081">here</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="carrying">Carrying</h2>

<p>Going SUL starts with the backpack for me. I want a comfortable, durable, and obviously really light backpack for short SUL Trips. HUCKEPACKS sent me their amazing <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/specials/packl-special/">PACKL Special</a> in Orange VX07 fabric, and I have been using this pack on short trips and day hikes since the spring. Now at 284 g and an extra 34 g for the foam CCF pad on the inside experienced hikers immediately will say <em>‚ÄúThere are lighter options!‚Äù</em> and they are right. For example the <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/packl-lite/">PACKL Lite</a>, also from HUCKEPACKS, is only 146 g <em>‚Äúheavy‚Äù</em> - that‚Äôs a whooping 138 g less, which in SUL Terms is A LOT. But I have the PACKL Special, and as my other equipment is really light, I can take this <em>slightly heavier</em> backpack üòÉ And with it‚Äôs three extra pockets for organizing and the two mesh pockets for water bottles, this pack keeps my stuff organized and easy to access. It‚Äôs also really pretty, and easy to see which is good if you‚Äôre hunting in areas where there‚Äôs hunting going on. But yeah, I‚Äôm tempted to maybe pick up the PACKL Lite next summer, to go even a bit more light‚Ä¶</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49955656098/in/dateposted/" title="√ñjenskogen Impressions"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49955656098_f20a8457a7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="√ñjenskogen Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sleeping">Sleeping</h2>

<p>MY SUL Sleep System is a combination of old and new gear. It is for me really amazing to see how some equipment has gotten progressively lighter over the last ten years, while other gear already was really light. The foundation of my comfortable &amp; warm sleep system is the <a href="https://tidd.ly/3jQB0JF">‚àû Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Uberlite</a> (<a href="https://youtu.be/5oXFCJi0TII">Here‚Äôs my Review</a>), an amazingly warm &amp; comfortable inflatable sleeping pad which weighs a mere 232 g in the Regular length. That is 120 g lighter than my previous summer UL mattress, the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite.html">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Xlite</a> (which I still own and use regularly). A CCF pad or two could lighter, but honestly - this mattress is so compact in pack size, is so warm, comfortable and easy to use, that I don‚Äôt see a reason to use any other mattress.</p>

<p>My Medium-Length and Standard Width <a href="https://zpacks.com/products/30f-classic-sleeping-bag">ZPACKS Classic Sleeping Bag</a> is 340 g light, and this quilt is 10-ish years old. It‚Äôs a quilt I use on warm summer trips where I know the night temperatures will not go below 5¬∞C (preferably a bit higher, though) and I absolutely LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è the amazing pack size of this quilt. It can be compressed to the size of a small loaf of bread with the cuben stuff-compression bag (18 g), something I can not do with my similarly great <a href="https://katabaticgear.com/shop/chisos-sleeping-bag/">Katabatic Gear Chisos 40¬∞F quilt</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, so keep the Mosquitos away and stay protected from dew and rain splatters, I use the <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/millaris-bivy-sack/">As Tucas Millaris Bivy</a>. It‚Äôs 180 g light including the stuff sack, and is really spacious and also fits my winter sleeping bags. It works best against Mosquitos with two pegs to stake out the front, and then you can create with the elastic string a spacious interior space to sleep in, Mosquito-free. I used this sleep system also on my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/impressions-from-lemmenjoki-and-ivalojoki.html">recent trip in Lapland</a>, where it did a great job.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50137012222/in/dateposted/" title="Bed"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50137012222_214854e72b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bed" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="shelter">Shelter</h2>

<p>In addition to the aforementioned Bivy I also carry a tarp on my SUL Trips. You simply never can know when it starts to rain, or when the wind starts to blow so much that you want more protection. Hence a tarp. This <a href="https://www.gossamergear.com/collections/shelters-sleeping-pads/products/twinn-tarp">Gossamer Gear Tarp</a> isn‚Äôt made anymore, as I have a SUL Cuben version which weighs a mere 167 g incl. the straps. I also own &amp; can recommend the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=47cd1998-e608-4548-aa0f-3d33e964ad3a&amp;website_id=a037a589-aec6-4e81-920c-77b10ab91eff&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hyperlitemountaingear.com%2Fcollections%2Fultralight-backpacking-shelters-tents%2Fproducts%2Fflat-tarp">‚àû Hyperlite Mountain Gear Flat Tarp</a> but it‚Äôs a bit heavier with all the straps. I still love tarps and especially with a bivy it‚Äôs a great setup, also in bad, rainy and windy weather. This tarp is really spacious, and pretty easy to pitch thanks to the Catenary curves - that way it‚Äôs simple to get a good, tight pitch.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50165394418/in/dateposted/" title="SUL Setup Summer 2020"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50165394418_6e73f70bca_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="SUL Setup Summer 2020" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="kitchen">Kitchen</h2>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/the-2nd-renaissance-of-esbit.html">Back in 2013 I wrote about Esbit</a> and the Solid Fuel Cook System from LiteTrail is still what I use today on SUL trips in the summer. It‚Äôs still amazingly compact, easy to use, efficient and at 90 g for the stove, ground + windscreen, pot with lid and the stuff sack hard to beat. I also have a tiny 8 g knife in the pot, my foldable Esbit Spoon - though in a pinch you also could simply use a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/lifeventure-titanium-long-handled-spoon/?pid=10239">‚àûlong-handled spoon</a> instead - and the Esbit fuel tablets.</p>

<p>For water filtering and transport I have an old <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/salomon-soft-flask-std-42-water-bottle/?pid=10239">‚àû 500 ml Flask</a> and a <a href="https://youtu.be/CneJY3F6zuY">Katadyn BeFree</a> - though I have heard a lot of good about the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/salomon-soft-flask-xa-filter-water-bottle/?pid=10239">‚àû Salomon Soft Flask XA Filter</a> which is a bit lighter, but has a smaller volume. Nevertheless, I‚Äôd be curious to try the Salomon filter at some point - sadly a Waterfilter is something which one nowadays also should use in Finland, especially in areas where there‚Äôs a lot of other backpackers and hikers.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50166216747/in/dateposted/" title="SUL Esbit Kitchen"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50166216747_c150b7bb0f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="SUL Esbit Kitchen" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="hygiene">Hygiene</h2>

<p>My hygiene stuff is properly light - everything together a scant 37 g. I was lucky enough to find a foldable toothbrush years ago and I should have bought a few to stash away for the future. I also bring tooth silk and a tooth pick along because clean teeth are a bliss. I am using <a href="https://amzn.to/3fd2AgD">‚àû Dent Tabs</a> since many years - they‚Äôre easy to pack and use, really light and leave less trash than a tube of tooth paste. I tried dehydrating my own Dent Tabs, but that wasn‚Äôt successful so the ones from DentTabs they are! For soap and cleaning I use nothing else than <a href="https://amzn.to/313znzB">‚àû Dr. Bronners Peppermint</a>, I also have a few painkillers along, and a <a href="https://amzn.to/2BIt1xd">‚àû Lipbalm from ClimbOn</a>. The Lipbalm also works really well for small scratches, wounds and blisters, so is proper Multiuse. It‚Äôs also made from 100% natural materials, which is always a plus in my book. All that hygiene stuff goes into a 10 year old ZPacks Cuben fibre bag, which still holds up really well. And yes, toilet paper is missing in the list and is needed, but won‚Äôt slow me down üòâ</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50168619983/in/dateposted/" title="SUL Hygiene kit"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50168619983_1b5e51d53f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="SUL Hygiene kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="appareal">Appareal</h2>

<p>Lets start with the last bits of civilization: My wallet, keys, Suunto watch and phone. I bought a nice <a href="https://www.treadlitegear.co.uk/tread-lite-gear-zip-coin-card-case-wallet-from-83g-336-p.asp">wallet from Treadlite Gear</a> in which I have some Credit Cards and cash. My keys I usually leave at home/ car/ hotel depending on the trip, so these are not carried. On SUL trips I don‚Äôt take a camera as my Full Format <a href="https://amzn.to/2X9sE6d">‚àûSony A7 III</a> with the <a href="https://amzn.to/3jQ8x6P">‚àû GMaster 24-70 mm f/ 2.8 lens</a> is <strong>REALLY</strong> heavy, and the camera of my iPhone 7 is still plenty good for snaps in good weather. I am tempted to take my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/sony-rx100-iv-field-report.html">Sony RX 100 IV</a> at times, but then that is an additional 291 g ‚Ä¶ I also use the iPhone together with the <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/383480947">‚àû Hikepack App</a> for navigation, and I can get 4 days of use out of the phone if it is in Airplane mode and with Battery Savings on. In addition I have the <a href="https://amzn.to/2X8JaUb">‚àû Suunto Spartan Ultra</a> on my wrist which I use for tracking and navigation.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50032347368/in/dateposted/" title="Selfie on the M√§lsorleden"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50032347368_ee84847a0d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Selfie on the M√§lsorleden" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Depending on the weather + bugs to be expected I either wear shorts or a long pants. I have been a Houdini Friend in the past, and still am buying and wearing their garments if they suit me well, so most things are from Houdini - even if there are lighter options available, but I have these, the company does well for both people and the environment, so there‚Äôs no reason for me to buy different things. So, my <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/en-eu/clothing/shorts/ms-daybreak-shorts-249874?color=249874106">Daybreak Shorts</a> come on if I don‚Äôt expect a lot of Mosquitos and a lot of sun, and if the bugs are out then I put on the <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/en-eu/clothing/pants/ms-motion-pants-245174?color=245174174">Motion Lite Pants</a>. Both have zippered pockets, are durable, comfortable, have great freedom of movement and I can wear them for days on end.</p>

<p>On top I usually have a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/houdini-activist-tee-t-shirt/?pid=10239">‚àû Houdini Activist T-Shirt</a> as the material mix of Merino Wool and Lyocell is working really well for me, I can have this on for a week without a problem. You might see white sweat stains after that time, but it doesn‚Äôt smell bad and is still comfy to wear. Depending on the bugs/ wind/ sunshine I also might be wearing the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start windjacket</a>, which is still - 7 years later! - my favourite wind jacket. Underneath I usually wear <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/ortovox-120-comp-light-boxer-merino-base-layer/?pid=10239">‚àû Ortovox Comp Light Boxers</a>, at 54 g and being without any seams these are after much testing the best boxer shorts I have found. Their wide elastic ‚Äúbelt‚Äù doesn‚Äôt push or anything bad, it‚Äôs simply a really well designed boxer shorts which is very comfortable, again with the benefits of Merino Wool. If I wear shoes and socks, then the latter usually are <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/darn-tough-unstandard-stripe-crew-lightweight-with-cushion-sports-socks/?pid=10239">‚àû Darn Tough Socks</a> as these are simply really good - comfortable &amp; durable.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50057615823/in/dateposted/" title="LUNA Sandals OSO Flaco"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50057615823_f1e1f665f9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="LUNA Sandals OSO Flaco" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Footwear-wise I like to hike in the summer in my <a href="https://bit.ly/2BFopb7">‚àû Luna Sandals OSO Flaco</a>, these are simply AMAZING sandals and as soon as it is warm enough in Finland I will pretty much wear them all the time. But if it looks like there‚Äôs going to be rain, cold weather, lots of swamps to cross or mountains to climb, then other shoes come on. On my last trip I tried the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/inov-8-mudclaw-g-260-trail-running-shoes/?pid=10239">‚àû inov-8 Mudclaw G 260</a> which let me done a bit durability-wise, in wet weather I‚Äôm a huge fan of the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/la-sportiva-crossover-2-dot-0-gtx.html">La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX</a>, but I also use shoes from <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/brands/salomon/trail-running-shoes/?pid=10239">‚àû Salomon</a>, <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/on-cloudventure-peak-trail-running-shoes-bf/?pid=10239">‚àû On Running</a> and many other models from <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/brands/la-sportiva/trail-running-shoes-bf/for--men/?pid=10239">‚àû La Sportiva</a>.</p>

<p>In my pack I have three extra garment pieces on SUL Trips: The <a href="https://www.phdesigns.co.uk/waferlite-down-jacket-k-series">PHD WaferLite Down Jacket</a> which is hands-down the lightest and best down insulation piece I own for summer trips. 132 g light with a full zipper, it‚Äôs just the right jacket for fresh summer evenings where a cold wind blows or you need to huddle down in the rain under the tarp. The second and third apparel pieces are the <a href="https://www.montane.co.uk/mens-c1/unisex-podium-pull-on-p911">Montan Podium Pull-On</a> and <a href="https://www.montane.co.uk/unisex-c314/unisex-podium-pants-p910">Podium pants</a>. I wanted an SUL rain pants + jacket since ages, and was happy when Montane asked if I‚Äôd like to try them. These are quite a treat to carry at a combined weight of 203 g, and in the rain showers and thunderstorms I used them they have performed just fine and as you‚Äôd expect: They keep you dry.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49956161841/in/dateposted/" title="√ñjenskogen Impressions"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49956161841_6fc623970f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="√ñjenskogen Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As seen above, I also wear a cap and sunglasses. My eyes are sensitive to the sun, so a pair of protective shades like the <a href="https://tidd.ly/3094EBX">‚àû Oakley Latch</a> are mandatory for me on summer trips. The <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/patagonia-boardshort-label-funfarer-cap-cap/?pid=10239">‚àû Patagonia Boardshort Funfarer Cap</a> is comfortable and has a closed back, which I prefer in Mosquito season. And while it isn‚Äôt in my list, if I expect <strong>A LOT OF MOSQUITOS</strong> then the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/sea-to-summit-nano-mosquito-headnet-mosquito-net/?pid=10239">‚àû Sea to Summit Nano Mosquito Headnet</a> comes along (11 g extra, and so worth it!).</p>

<h2 id="food">Food</h2>

<p>I have a 95% Vegan diet since two years now, and it‚Äôs amazing how easy it is to eat healthy and tasty vegan food when outdoors. There‚Äôs a host of companies which make amazing vegan backpacking meals, so for people without the time to make meals yourself these are a really good option. I‚Äôm a huge fan of the <a href="https://tentmeals.co.uk/collections/main-meals">Tentmeals</a> meals &amp; breakfasts (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">My Patreons get a 25% Discount!</a>), the <a href="https://www.firepotfood.com/collections/firepot-dehydrated-meals/vegan">Firepot Vegan meals</a> are absolutely delicious and also the Vegan options from <a href="https://tidd.ly/2X2n0CX">‚àû LYO Food</a> are always something to look forward to after a day of hiking or packrafting. From back in the day when I also was eating meat, fish and poultry I can recommend meals from the aforementioned brands and also <a href="https://realoutdoorfood.com/products/">REAL Turmat</a>.</p>

<p>Snack-wise I mix Chili Nuts and Honey-Roasted Nuts together, this is my absolute ‚Äú<strong>Feel-Good Food</strong>‚Äù which helps me to stay motivated when I have a long day or a steep climb up a mountain. Similiarly I use <a href="https://tidd.ly/2P6YYSG">‚àû Clif Bar Shot Bloks</a> as these are easy to consume, tasty, and the ones with coffein allow me to skip the coffee breaks if the day calls for it. Speaking of coffee, I use <a href="https://www.naturata.de/bio-produkte/kaffee-kakao/espresso-kaffee-sticks-bohnenkaffee-instant-25g/">Naturata Espresso Sticks</a>  since this year, it‚Äôs easier to get than than Starbucks Via, in my opinion even tastier, and it‚Äôs also Fair Trade and Organic.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50165422998/in/dateposted/" title="Light &amp; tasty food"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50165422998_a9c6bcd8a2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Light &amp; tasty food" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>

<p>This article, <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/z1a081">list</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/sYMGl8INJMo">video</a> show that it is nowadays extremely easy to carry really little &amp; very light equipment on your backpacking trips while still being safe, comfortable, well-fed, dry in the rain and warm at night. 95% of people hiking on maintained trails don‚Äôt need much more than what is shown in the article - and even if they do (a map and compass is a good addition, as could be a powerbank and maybe some fresh clothes for camp) the added weight still will have them carry less than what the majority of people seem to carry outdoors in Finland. Which is not to say those carrying more are doing something wrong, as they are not, though I often encounter these people bent forward from their heavy backpacks, which they put down as soon as an opportunity arises.</p>

<p>That gives the appearance that with a heavy backpack the hiking part of a backpacking trip isn‚Äôt enjoyed a lot, and for me that is where I see most of nature and I get the most enjoyment. With a light pack I can walk straight and unencumbered, I am able to let my eyes take in the surroundings - be it the Black-throated loon on the lake, the Reindeer which is grazing a few meters besides me on the fjell, the Marmot which is alerting it‚Äôs family of my arrival or the beautiful wildflowers which grow along the trail. For me the hiking part is where I see most on my trips, which makes me feel happy, and hence it is for me a lot more enjoyable to hike with a SUL Pack in the summer! I hope you try some of the things in this article, and if you have questions, feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a>!</p>

<p>This trip was spontaneous. I posted online, looking for a ride to Lapland, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oolaw/">Olli</a> replied. Turns out, Olli and I got along really well, and I think this was just the first trip we went on together. Well, sort of together, as I went to Lemmenjoki National park, hiking south through it, to the Repojoki river, which would join the mighty Ivalojoki river a bit later, while Olli continued to the impressive Kevo National park and it‚Äôs amazing canyon. I have 190 gb of Video to go through and edit, so for the moment please enjoy these photos from the trip, where also the weather was really fantastic (though there were too many Mosquitos and Black Flies for my liking).</p>

<p>Lemmenjoki National Park was surprisingly busy. You only can get here with an own car, but the Parking Lots were full and there was a steady flow of people using the shuttle boats from Njurgulahti to Kultahamina and back. I spent 3 days here, and had a great time - even though I had to wear my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody-windproof-jacket/?pid=10239">Alpine Start Hoody</a> almost all the time because of the Mosquitos!</p>

<p>After crossing Lemmenjoki I inflated <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/Anfibio-packrafts/Anfibio-Rebel-2K::889.html?language=en">my packraft</a> at the Repojoki bridge we had passed three days earlier by car, and started to paddle. First I had some headwind and safety concerns (paddling on your own in big, wild rivers is not recommended) but after the first rapids, lots of sunshine and warm weather my mood turned and I was able to enjoy the packrafting for this and the following days.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs Friday, I had a mediocre week, the weather forecast is amazing and we wanna go to the beach. I do feel like sleeping outside, though. <em>‚ÄúShould we go to the Bj√∂rk√∂by beach?‚Äù</em> I ask my wife, <em>‚ÄúThen I could go backpacking and you pick me up tomorrow in Panike?‚Äù</em>. <em>‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs fine.‚Äù</em> Well, that went a lot easier than I expected. I pack my HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite pack with a few items, strap the Anfibio Rebel 2K packraft on top and slide the Wave paddle into the side pockets, and then we head out to the Archipelago.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50057619978/in/dateposted/" title="All along the Watchtower"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50057619978_e2052f4e83_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="All along the Watchtower" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We‚Äôre pretty much alone at the beach, it‚Äôs 23¬∞C and a light breeze goes - perfect weather. The kids love it, there‚Äôs fish everywhere and they try to catch them - even successfully at times. Fish are released, water melon is eaten, and then it‚Äôs time for me to start hiking at 19:00 o‚Äôclock. I say good bye to my family and start walking on the familiar <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/a-family-hike-on-the-bodvattnet-runt.html">Bodvattnet Runt trail</a> towards the L√•nggrund fire place. The first kilometres are familiar, then I take a right and soon am swarmed by Mosquitos from the left, right, front and back. They don‚Äôt seem to be bothered by the repellant I sprayed on earlier, so all I can do is to hike faster. After 45 Minutes I arrive at the Fire shelter, which looks lovely.</p>

<p>I drop my pack on a bench, take off my sweaty shirt, and walk out on the jetty. A Barn Swallow circles me, flying low above the water. I see a pair of Whopper Swans feed between the small islets, and in the distance the birdwatching Tower and buildings of Svedjehamn can be seen. I check my map, and start looking for the trail to the other jetty, from where I will be heading into sea.</p>

<p>I reach a land tongue 10 minutes later after hiking on a largely overgrown trail. This next section only can be reached if you organize boat transfer in advance - or if you have your own packraft along. I roll out the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/Anfibio-Packrafts/Anfibio-Rebel-2K::889.html">Rebel 2K</a>, inflate it and put it down in the water so that the air in the tubes can cool down, so I can top it up before heading out. The wind is coming against me, but it‚Äôs only around 5 m/s so not too bad. After everything is packed aboard I sit down, close the spray deck and start to paddle. The sun shines on my right, it‚Äôs warm and I enjoy the sound of the water sloshing against the raft. It‚Äôs a very natural sound, and so relaxing.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50058433217/in/dateposted/" title="Packrafting on Djupfj√§rden"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50058433217_68e9c0bd22_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Packrafting on Djupfj√§rden" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I paddle south-west in the middle of the Baltic, left and right of me the rising lands and islands. There are sections where the water is not even 30 cm deep, and I am happy that with my packraft I‚Äôm sitting pretty high in the water. Arctic Terns fly above me and check out what I‚Äôm up to, more Whopper Swans are looking for food along the shores, Great Crested Grebes dive away when they see me coming, only to surface 20 m further away. And then there‚Äôs lots, and lots of gulls: Black-Headed Gulls, Common Gulls, Herring Gulls and Great Black-backed Gulls all fly, sit and swim around me. As the wind is pushing me back to where I come from I only can keep on paddling, and when I arrive behind an island I can take in the view. It‚Äôs beautiful.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50058189326/in/dateposted/" title="Landing at Sondas√∂ren"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50058189326_1be31a2a12_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Landing at Sondas√∂ren" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At 22:35 o‚Äôclock I land on the Sondas√∂ren island. According to my map there should be a place for camping here somewhere, but after a short stroll across the island and not finding it I decide to simply cowboy camp some 60 m up from the shore. I carry the packraft up, put it up as a sort of windbreak/ hoping it gives me some shadow in the early morning. I‚Äôm hungry after paddling some 3,5 km and hiking a similar distance, and after I rolled out my bivy I take out the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/msr-windburner-10-l-personal-stove-system-gas-stove/?pid=10239">MSR Windburner</a> and boil some of the water which I brought along. Because this being the Baltic, it‚Äôs salt water, and hence I carried 3,5 kg of water with me from the start, by far the heaviest item in my pack!</p>

<p>I prepare my <a href="http://tidd.ly/ade9e651">Nettle Curry from LYO Food</a>, have a cup of mint tea, and enjoy the view. The sun is still up, a beautiful dusk is falling over the islands, and I hear sheep baa across the island, as well as some bells ring. Later the next day I will find out that on my island and the one I‚Äôll be traversing the next day around 200 sheep are grazing the whole summer, and I also will see them the next morning.</p>

<p>Close to midnight I slide into the <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/millaris-bivy-sack/">As Tucas Millaris Bivy</a>, put my head down on the still fantastic <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/therm-a-rest-neoair-uberlight-sleeping-mat/?pid=10239">NeoAir Uberlight</a> and pull the ZPacks 10¬∞ quilt a bit over me. It‚Äôs a warm night, and soon the Mosquitos start to appear above my mesh window. They can‚Äôt get to me, but I decide to grab some of the death twigs and create a small tripod from where I can hang the bivy so the mesh net isn‚Äôt close to my face. While out collecting the twigs I also admire the almost orange moon which is setting in the west. It is beautiful.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50057617788/in/dateposted/" title="00:53"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50057617788_d52a519818_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="00:53" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At 6:30 I‚Äôm awoken as a flock of sheep is having a look at me in my bivy, and as they see me sitting up they take flight. I switch the airplane mode of the phone off and check the weather forecast, as right now the sky is grey and high winds come from the North. Yep, even higher winds are forecasted, so instead of sleeping in I pack everything up and am before 7:00 o‚Äôclock back in my packraft. The wind is so strong that it picks up water from the sea, which has the effect of rain coming from the side. It looks worse than it actually is - I guess some things stuck from my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/iwg/">Wilderness Guide Education 10 years ago</a> - and 15 Minutes later I paddle up to the jetty at Sl√•ttsk√§ret. I carry everything up to the Laavu and have breakfast.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50058188321/in/dateposted/" title="Sl√•ttsk√§ret Laavu"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50058188321_92475bba91_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sl√•ttsk√§ret Laavu" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The sun comes out, though the wind keeps up, and a while later I start my hike on the island. The trail here is at times easy to follow and see, and at other times it‚Äôs pretty over grown. It passes geological sites - witnesses of our last ice age - and more recent additions, like shelters for the sheep which are grazing on the island. Along the way I see several Heath Spotted Orchids and a young White-tailed deer stag jumps across the trail and into the forest after it saw and heard me. It‚Äôs a beautiful, warm and windy morning, the Mosquitos aren‚Äôt out in force yet, and I enjoy the short hike to the end of the island.</p>

<p>I arrive after 1,5 hours at the end of the trail, and again walk down to the jetty. By now there‚Äôs 10 m/s winds and the waves have white crowns. Happily the Wind comes from North East, which is from my side, and it will push me toward the land where I have to go. I inflate the Rebel 2K for the final time, pack my backpack inside and sit down in the raft. I pull the hood of my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody-windproof-jacket/?pid=10239">Alpine Start Hoody</a> over my cap, and push away from the jetty. The first few strokes are easy and no problem, but once I am in the wind it means <em>‚ÄúAll Hands on Deck‚Äù</em> as I need to keep the raft in the direction and keep on paddling, to not get pushed somewhere I don‚Äôt want to go, or worse. Towards the shore there‚Äôs some big waves and it‚Äôs a bumpy ride, but then again everything really is under control as I keep a calm head and know what I have to do (The first thing I should have done would have been to have a pfd along!).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50058428022/in/photostream/" title="10 m/s Wind"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50058428022_baab8d1637_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="10 m/s Wind" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50058185196/in/photostream/" title="Panike Harbour"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50058185196_b9723f4a3c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Panike Harbour" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>20 Minutes later I arrive in the harbour of Panike, pull the packraft out of the water and walk up to a picknick table. This is the end of the road, and it‚Äôs just as silent. There‚Äôs a few summer cottages, a handful of boats are tied at the pier, and a hare is sitting in the grass at the side of the road, wondering maybe what that big heap of plastic is which is laying there in the sun. I dry the raft, roll it up, and wait for my ride back to Vaasa, while the wind is bending the top of the trees around me. What a beautiful hike this was, with beautiful views and weather. If you ever visit Finland and already have hiked the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/06/the-10-best-hikes-in-finland.html">9 Best Hikes of Finland</a> and look for something new, consider this combined packrafting and hiking trip. I think it is great to try packrafting in a save environment, and it‚Äôs pretty lonely - great for a weekend hike!</p>

<p>Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic we‚Äôre all mostly <em>‚Äústuck at home‚Äù</em> in our countries - which isn‚Äôt a bad thing at all, as this allows us to go explore where we live and pay taxes! This pandemic also has brought a lot of people into the outdoors, and obviously the first thing you should familiarize yourself with are the <a href="https://lnt.org">Leave No Trace principles</a> so you don‚Äôt <em>accidentally</em> leave your trash and poo somewhere where it does not belong - don‚Äôt be one of those jerks who throws trash into nature. Now that we have these essential rules out of the way, let me show you the gear you need when you go backpacking. The idea is to help you <strong>save money and only get what you REALLY need</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quick Definition! Hiking: The activity of walking in nature, but sleeping indoors. Backpacking: The activity of walking AND sleeping outdoors in nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="clothes">Clothes</h2>

<p>The Easiest and most difficult point right at the start. The easiest because I firmly believe that most people can go hiking in their normal sports clothes on their first trips. If you have a synthetic/ wind-resistant pants or shorts for running or sports, chances are these are fine for your first backpacking trip. Some things to keep in mind, though:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don‚Äôt wear jeans when backpacking. They are too warm, too heavy, stay wet forever if it rains, and are mostly uncomfortable and restrict your movement.</li>
  <li>Except on the hottest 30¬∞C or more days, don‚Äôt wear cotton shirts. Like jeans, they need too long to dry and if it gets cool don‚Äôt keep you warm.</li>
  <li>Avoid heavy ‚Äúhiking‚Äù boots, use trailrunning or sport shoes with a good, grippy sole instead.</li>
  <li>Invest into some good socks and underwear for hiking!</li>
  <li>You can take a (fleece) jogging pants, a comfy shirt and possibly some woolen socks for camp along</li>
</ul>

<p>It is very easy to spend thousands of ¬£$‚Ç¨ on clothes for hiking, and completely unnecessary for a beginner. Some sports clothes or airy fabric trousers with good freedom of movement and maybe some wind resistance are fine, together with a synthetic or Merino wool T-shirt. Most people own a fleece jacket, which works fine for insulation on summer days, and most also own a rain jacket. If you really want to start to invest into clothes for backpacking I‚Äôd recommend getting a good pair of light trailrunning shoes. Now, you won‚Äôt be running, but these types of shoes are comfortable all day long, you are unlikely to get blisters in them, they have great grip on muddy, wet and slippery terrain and they also are light. Go on a few day hikes before you take them backpacking, to see if they work for you. In 99% of the cases, they do üòä!</p>

<p><em>A detailed article on garments for hiking and backpacking will follow this month, so stay tuned if this topic interests you!</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7807588712/in/album-72157630936718764/" title="You can&#x27;t climb mountains in trailrunners"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7131/7807588712_df00e66139_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="You can&#x27;t climb mountains in trailrunners" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And finally, under clothes - <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/swix-pro-trail-carbon-120-trekking-pole.html">trekking poles</a>. Some people swear on them for hiking, others are happy without them. I both like them when I need them - for example when fording rivers, hiking through swamps, and demanding terrain, and I also am happy without them. Hence I like Poles which fold up small and are light, so that when I carry them they fits nicely to the side of the pack. If trekking poles are for you - you might want to see for yourself and test some, maybe loan a pair from friends for a hike and see how you get on with them. However, if your shelter needs Poles - you probably will not get around using them!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7807416278" title="HMG Porter &amp; BD Z-Poles"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/8432/7807416278_d55bc283b3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="HMG Porter &amp; BD Z-Poles" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="kitchen--water">Kitchen &amp; Water</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs also easy to spend a few hundred ‚Ç¨$¬£ on the kitchen and water carrying stuff. For the start of your backpacking hobby, get a good water filter like the <a href="https://youtu.be/CneJY3F6zuY">Katadyn BeFree</a>. This filter is very easy to use, and while there sometimes are some durability issues with the flask the customer service from Katadyn is very good and quickly sends out replacement flasks. You might want to pick up a second light water bottle (I can recommend the <a href="https://cnocoutdoors.com/collections/vecto-family/products/2019-vecto-2l-28mm?variant=20550036357209">CNOC Vecto 2l</a>) if you hike in environments where there‚Äôs not a spring every few kilometres and for camp. I also always carry a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/10/kupilka-review.html">Kupilka Kuksa</a> - the bigger one is the ideal size to prepare TentMeals in, and also for a big cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998094941/in/photostream/" title="Water and drinking"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998094941_5880327b29_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Water and drinking" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I believe that gas stoves with a Piezo ignition are the most user-friendly for beginners and experts alike, and the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/primus-lite-gas-stove/?pid=10239">Primus Lite+ Stove</a> is the most affordable one in this segment. It is light, compact, available in a variety of nice colours and very easy to use. It works well for two people, and it is fast to bring water to a boil, too. Once you want to go backpacking more it is fine to do your research on <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/the-2nd-renaissance-of-esbit.html">other stoves</a>, but for beginners an easy and convenient to use gas stove is the best investment.</p>

<h2 id="food--snacks">Food &amp; Snacks</h2>

<p>On a longer backpacking trip food and snacks will be the heaviest thing in your backpack. Food for a week weighs for me around 5 kg, give or take, and happily this gets lighter every day. I have a plant-based diet and it‚Äôs completely possible to have nutritious, tasty vegan backpacking meals every day for a week without that you feel like <em>‚ÄúUuuagh, again the same?!‚Äù</em>. If you eat everything, it gets even easier. My favourite vegan meals are from Tent Meals and my Patreons get a 25% discount on their orders, so it‚Äôs totally worth it to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">join my Patreon tribe</a> and save on these tasty meals. Also FirePot, LYO Food, Bl√•Band and REAL Turmat make good vegan backpacking meals, and as this is going to fuel your adventure, don‚Äôt save money on these. I made that mistake on my first backpacking trips, thinking that a normal ‚Äújust add water‚Äù meal from the Supermarket is just as good, and I <strong>a)</strong> didn‚Äôt feel like eating them after two days and <strong>b)</strong> they don‚Äôt deliver the same amount of calories than the specialized backpacking meals. It feels expensive to spend 7 to 10‚Ç¨ on one backpacking dinner, but it‚Äôs really worth it - and if you‚Äôd be in a city, you would easily spend more than that on a dinner!</p>

<p>As for Snacks, I am a huge fan of honey-roasted and chili nuts with some chocolate raisins thrown in for variety. I also know that especially the Nuts will make you hugely popular with fellow hikers, so take enough to last you and a friend through the trip :) I also consume the <a href="https://www.clifbar.com/products/clif/bloks-energy-chews/black-cherry">ClifBar Bloks</a> as they are excellent to get fast energy, are tasty, and really easy to use. I have tried normal ClifBars on various trips, but for me they simply are <em>‚Äútoo much‚Äù</em> and I prefer the Bloks + Nuts.</p>

<p>Coffee, Tea and Hot Chocolate are my hot drinks staples when outdoors. I have a minimum of three <a href="https://www.naturata.de/bio-produkte/kaffee-kakao/espresso-kaffee-sticks-bohnenkaffee-instant-25g/">Naturata Espresso Sticks</a> per day with me, these are easier to source than the equally good Starbucks Via, then one or two bags of tea per day, and one bag of Hot chocolate per day, as my little treat before going to sleep. Other than that I drink water, water, water, just like home =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998346927/in/dateposted/" title="Tea, Coffee, Hot Chocolate"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998346927_3a6581e412_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tea, Coffee, Hot Chocolate" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="hygiene--first-aid">Hygiene &amp; First Aid</h2>

<p>Thanks to the Pandemic we all know that we should wash our hands, outdoors this is maybe even a tad more important as we usually touch stones, trees, roots, plants and dirt when we scramble up places or walk through nature. So a good bio-degradable soap (I recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/2URUK51">Dr. Bonners Mint</a>) needs to come along, as well as a small bottle of Disinfectant. You always should brush your teeth, so a tooth brush, some tooth silk or a tooth pick, and a bio-degradable toothpaste (I prefer <a href="https://amzn.to/3hf6aJz">Dent Tabs</a> by far) need to go into the Hygiene kit, and then anything else one might want or need (stuff for contact lenses for example). I also always carry a ClimbOn LipBalm as it is great to not get dry lips and also can be applied to mosquito bites or small cuts. If you are popular with Mosquitos, an insect repellant is good to take along, or you use a headnet and long clothes to keep them off. Similarly sunscreen is useful on hikes where there is no shade and you expect to hike in the sun. You don‚Äôt need to buy these things except maybe the soap and disinfectant - use on your first hikes the same things you have at home.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998094766/in/photostream/" title="My Hygine Kit"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998094766_6ca06ba24a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="My Hygine Kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My First Aid kit is absolut minimalist, there‚Äôs a small bottle of mint oil (it works great against headaches for me), a few painkillers and band-aids in there, and that is it. I also have here a small repair kit - some patches for my air mattress, some duct tape, a security needle and that‚Äôs that. If I <strong>really</strong> need medical attention I prefer to call for help instead of trying to patch myself up with some surgical dressings which you find in the 1st Aid kits you can buy everywhere. And as in my Hygiene and First Air Kit I also have a <em>‚Äúlarge‚Äù</em> towel I can use that as a bandage if I feel I can take care of myself. Speaking of the towel, I long thought I don‚Äôt need it, but it has proven to be something that is multi-functional and hence comes along again: I can dry myself after a dip in a river or lake, wipe the dew from my shelter in the morning, hold a hot pot with it or, as above, use it as a band-aid üòÉ</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49997574068/in/photostream/" title="FA Kit"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49997574068_231c047b73_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="FA Kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="backpack">Backpack</h2>

<p>Now actually I‚Äôd put the backpack as the latest item you buy, but as this item sits totally in-between day hiking and backpacking I feel I can not talk about it at the end. However, I recommend getting this as the last item if possible, simply as it means you can purchase one which fits all the gear and food which you will have for your backpacking trips. Backpacks are a difficult topic and what works for one person does not necessarily work for another one. If you have a small, local outdoor shop go visit them, but don‚Äôt let them sell you the most expensive or heavy backpack. Osprey and Gregory are two brands which make nowadays good lightweight backpacks with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/01/osprey-levity-45-review.html">Exos</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/11/osprey-exos-48-review.html">Levity</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/gregory-optic-48.html">Optic</a> (women models are available for these, too!) and these are the models you should ask for in your shop. A backpack which has around 50 l is a good volume to aim for, with some careful packing it is good for all the gear a backpacking beginner takes along, plus the food, and this size pack also still works fine for day hikes as you can compress them nicely.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49997573963/in/photostream/" title="Packs!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49997573963_f4ee567bc6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Packs!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now real ultralight backpacking brands like <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de">HUCKEPACKS</a>, Sierra Designs, Six Moon Designs and Gossamer Gear, to name just a few, are pretty much only available online. If you want, it is totally worth it to purchase one of their backpacks, though you‚Äôll need to measure your back length, make decisions on materials and features you want, which is already quite a bit of research - of course you just can <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">read my reviews</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hendrikmorkel">watch my videos</a> to do that research, and buy accordingly üòÉ But again, I believe that a beginner should visit a independent, local gear shop and ask for one of these backpacks mentioned above, and try if they work for her or him. So far 100% of the people who got one of these packs after my recommendation are really happy with them, which is why I feel confident in recommending them (they are great packs, too!). If you then decide to pursue backpacking as a hobby you can get one of the lighter packs from the cottage brands!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44199759745/in/album-72157702073100795/" title="Stor√•d√∂rren Valley from the other side n better weather"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1903/44199759745_b4b7e1753e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Stor√•d√∂rren Valley from the other side n better weather" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="shelter">Shelter</h2>

<p>While a backpack usually doesn‚Äôt cost more than 200‚Ç¨ with the shelter and sleep system we get into an area where things get pricey. My recommendations here are to get good quality kit which does not break the bank for a beginner, if one wants to go backpacking more there‚Äôs always the option to get something different. I think most people want something which keeps bugs out (as them  üï∑ ü¶Ç are out in force in the summer). The <a href="https://www.tarptent.com/product/double-rainbow/">Double Rainbow from Tarptent</a> is a proven design at a really good price. A tent with a similar construction, slightly heavier but way easier to get in Europe and elsewhere, is the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/msr-elixir-2-2-man-tent/?pid=10239">MSR Elixir 2</a>. If your budget is a bit higher then the <a href="https://www.outdoorline.sk/en/tents/big-agnes-fly-creek-hv-ul2-ultralight-tent">Big Agnes Fly Creek HV UL2</a> or the <a href="https://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/equipment-c3/tents-shelters-c25/two-person-tents-c26/lunar-duo-explorer-2p-tent-p3325">Six Moon Designs Lunar Duo Explorer 2P Tent</a> are very good picks.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49997180938/in/dateposted/" title="Camp"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49997180938_ed7115939b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Camp" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I myself really like to sleep under a Tarp or in a Pyramide-style shelter. The <a href="https://locusgear.com/items/hapi-sil/?lang=en">Locus Gear Hapi Sil</a> is an amazing Pyramide tent, the <a href="https://www.gossamergear.com/collections/shelters-sleeping-pads/products/twinn-tarp">Gossamer Gear Twinn Tarp</a> is an absolute Classic which is easy to pitch and has a lot of dry space under it, and the <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/millaris-bivy-sack/">As Tucas Millaris Bivy Sack</a> works with either of these shelters or on it‚Äôs own if the sky is clear!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/38085020741/in/dateposted/" title="Locus Gear Hapi Sil in the morning"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4469/38085020741_56f5f2ece7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Locus Gear Hapi Sil in the morning" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If you go backpacking in Finland, Sweden or Norway you also might be able to not take a shelter at all, as you could sleep simply in one of the hundreds of free, open Wilderness Huts. The problem which might arise is that the hut is full and you can‚Äôt sleep there, so having a shelter along is always recommended. There are Huts in Finland which you can reserve, so the <em>‚ÄúThe Hut is full‚Äù</em> Problem won‚Äôt arise. And while these huts are AMAZING I do like to sleep outside, hear the birds chirp and the wind blow through the leafs. Plus you won‚Äôt be awoken by other hut inhabitants when they leave at 5:00 o‚Äôclock.</p>

<h2 id="sleep-system">Sleep System</h2>

<p>Your sleep system consists of a sleeping pad, a quilt or sleeping bag and possibly a pillow (I use a insulation jacket and fold it into a pillow). The <a href="https://youtu.be/5oXFCJi0TII">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Uberlite</a> is an outstanding mattress, but maybe beginners are a bit better off with getting a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite.html">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite</a> as it is more durable and cheaper while still being light and compact. If you like to sleep on a hard underground, then the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/exped-flexmat-plus-sleeping-mat/?pid=10239">Exped Flexmat Plus</a> is a great pick as it can not break and at 40‚Ç¨ it is really cheap, while being very comfortable.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998095396/in/photostream/" title="Sleeping well"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998095396_73cbece14b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sleeping well" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At home you sleep under a duvet, and outdoors the next best thing is a quilt. I really like my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/as-tucas-sestrals-quilt.html">As Tucas Sestrals Quilt</a>, also the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/enlightened-equipment-revelation-quilts.html">enLIGHTened Equipment Revelation Quilts</a> are a very good pick, and if money is no issue I suggest getting a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/01/katabatic-gear-sawatch-quilt.html">Katabatic Gear Quilt</a>. If social and sustainable issues are important to you, have a look at the good <a href="http://tidd.ly/3d3b83f5">Vaude Alpstein 450</a>, which is a really good quilt. Again, there‚Äôs a lot of options here, but amongst those which I mentioned you can find something which suits your budget and needs!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42298562271" title="As Tucas Sestrals Quilt, front view"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/878/42298562271_534ffe1d92_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="As Tucas Sestrals Quilt, front view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="navigation-maps-and-extras">Navigation, Maps and Extras</h2>

<p>The final point on my list is about the small items which are needed to not get lost and to remember. A map and compass are pretty useful when going into nature, and I recommend for the first few trips that you stay on trails and use the map to get safely from A to B. Also an App like <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/383480947">HikePack</a> is very good to navigate (and there‚Äôs a free version!), and might be easier to use than a compass and map for beginners (despite this, the latter are important skills to learn and master!). I also carry a small <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/expedition">Field Notes Brand notebook</a> + pen with me, and obviously a camera. Unless you‚Äôre already a photographer and own a good camera, just use your phone for photos. If this is an aspect you‚Äôd like to pursue more passionately at some point, feel free to hit me up on Twitter and ask me about camera recommendations! Finally, a headlamp like the <a href="http://tidd.ly/d33332f9">Petzl Bindi</a> is good to have along if you need to get out at night or if you get up early/ stay up late. Here in the North it‚Äôs something you not necessarily need in the summer, as it doesn‚Äôt really get dark.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/39677567295/in/dateposted/" title="Plans"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4629/39677567295_fd946587cb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Plans" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The best thing is if you simply could ask a good friend (like me, right Tumppi ;) who totally is into outdoor stuff and has a bunch of gear to kit you out for your first backpacking trip. That way you can see what works for you and don‚Äôt need to make purchases which may work well for you. But not everyone has that friend, so the next best thing is to do your research online, learn from other people‚Äôs mistakes and experience, and buy the right gear from the start (this does involve trusting these friends, and not deciding to throw away all the recommendations and simply buy what you think is best, just to realize after some use that the knowledgable friend actually was right all along‚Ä¶). To make checking the gear you have &amp; need easier I made <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bjsgcr5KmPblSjvjvQs3To6iCU7LYqNBczFazSJNX80/edit?usp=sharing">this Checklist</a> which you can copy &amp; paste or print out. With the list in your hands you make sure you don‚Äôt waste money on kit which you don‚Äôt need, and my tips here hopefully help you figure out which gear is worth getting. The most important thing, however, is to enjoy being outdoors.</p>

<p>Backpacking in nature is the single best way to connect to the natural environment, learn to appreciate it and see why it is so important to protect wild places. For us humans going into nature has a tremendously positive effect on our mental health, creativity and also our physical health, as several scientific articles have highlights in the past couple of years. And the whole experience of backpacking gets more enjoyable &amp; fun the less unnecessary &amp; heavy equipment we carry along while outdoors. With this article read you now know what gear you need for your first backpacking trip, and I hope it will be a most memorable one!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>‚ÄúFinland, Finland, Finland, it‚Äôs the country where I want to be‚Äù</em>  is a great song by Monty Python, and now that you have it stuck in your head you probably want to find out about the best hiking destinations in this Northern European country which is well-known for its 180.000 lakes, 75% forest cover and more than a million of Saunas!</p>

<p><em>This list is in no particular order or ranking.</em></p>

<h2 id="hetta-pallas-trail">Hetta-Pallas Trail</h2>

<p>Fresh in my mind is the Hetta-Pallas Trail, which I skied in March this year. Besides amazingly cozy huts the scenery is MINDBLOWING. No wonder this is one of Finland‚Äôs first National Parks and one of the oldest hiking trail (it was known as Pallas-Ounastunturi National Park till 2005, when it was doubled in size as the Yll√§s-Aakenus Nature Reserve was put together with the old National Park). What I loved the most on the Hetta-Pallas Trail were the fjells and the views. Going south from Hetta this amazing view of the fjells opens up, and once you have climbed the first summit you can see far into the distance and enjoy this breath-taking scenery. In the summer the trail takes you across the highest summits, and is definitely something I will return for!</p>

<h2 id="st-olavs-trail">St. Olavs Trail</h2>

<p>The St. Olavs trail is a former pilgrimage path leading from Turku in Finland, to the √Öland Islands, through Sweden and all the way to Trondheim in Norway. The Finnish part of the trail is leading you through the Finnish archipelago with stunning views of the countless islands. The trail is pretty easy and accessible, with accommodation options along the way if you don‚Äôt feel like camping. For those who love the water, this trail is a true gem - and my favourite in Finland.</p>

<h2 id="sipoonkorpi-national-park">Sipoonkorpi National Park</h2>

<p>As we now are already pretty far south in Finland, it‚Äôs good to shed some light ‚Äú<em>on the other National Park near Helsinki</em>‚Äù. Nuuksio is normally already pretty busy with hikers, and now that everyone and their dog head into the forest you better jump on a bus to Sipoonkorpi National Park. You can find some great trails and spots for a lunch here, Sipoo is small enough to explore it in a day if you hike fast, and big enough for a long weekend to see all parts of the National Park and not needing to hurry through it.</p>

<h2 id="repovesi-national-park">Repovesi National Park</h2>

<p>Finnish climbers love Repovesi National Park, as it is home to some of the highest rock climbing routes - and definitely the most picturesque. Where else can you take a rowboat to the start of a climbing route? But also hikers, backpackers and packrafters love Repovesi National Park with its great hanging bridges, beautiful lakes and channels for paddling, not to mention the great viewing points from the top of the hills which dot the forested landscape. What is unique, too, is the possibility to use a fox-ferry, and if you want you to paddle with a packraft or canoe here, you‚Äôll find great lakes &amp; channels which connect them.</p>

<h2 id="helvetinjrvi--seitseminen-national-parks">Helvetinj√§rvi &amp; Seitseminen National Parks</h2>

<p>I have been a lot to these two National Parks, as they were the closest to the city of Tampere where I lived for five years. They‚Äôre pretty, with great infrastructure, cultural sights and always good for a surprise - be it the warm water of the lakes which are inviting for a swim, or the tasty mushrooms which you can find in the forest. There‚Äôs surprisingly few people around during the week, but in the weekends the famous spots attract a lot of people - these can be avoided if you go to the less popular (but just as pretty) spots in the two National Parks!</p>

<h2 id="ruka-kuusamo-area">Ruka-Kuusamo Area</h2>

<p>The Ruka-Kuusamo area and Oulanka National Park are one of the most popular hiking destinations in Finland - and for a good reason. This area is known for old forests, deep river canyons &amp; rapids and in the winter you¬¥ll find the most picturesque snowy trees here. The location in North-East Finland makes this place an interesting combination of Arctic Nature and Siberian Taiga, you can see it in both Flora and Fauna. The most famous trail is the Bear‚Äôs Trail but there are many other options for hikers too. Scrambling up the Konttainen Hill and gazing the Midnight Sun is one of our traditions that we do every Summer. There are so many beautiful Outdoor destinations in Finland but for it‚Äôs versatility this area is definitely one of our top destinations!</p>

<h2 id="urho-kekkonen-national-park">Urho Kekkonen National Park</h2>

<p>The Urho Kekkonen National Park is something of a national treasure in Finland. It has it all: Amazing off-the-beaten track backpacking through the fjells, great views, lovely lakes and rivers, cozy huts and a lot of Saunas in which to relax after a day of hiking. It is the choice for more advanced backpackers who know how to navigate and feel comfortable to hike away from the few trails, and who obviously also know how to practice Leave-No-Trace. If that‚Äôs you - start planning a hike in this beautiful National Park!</p>

<h2 id="pyrisjrvi">P√∂yrisj√§rvi</h2>

<p>Almost like sitting in the shoulders of the Maiden of Finland (Suomineito), the P√∂yrisj√§rvi wilderness area is a dream hiking destination for experienced hikers and people who love to fish. The area takes its name from Lake P√∂yrisj√§rvi, surrounded by the photogenic sand dunes, large woodlands and hilly fells. Endless hiking possibilities will take you around the wilderness as long and as far as you have power to go. Pro tip: bass loves the combination of black, blue and gold. Try it, and you might have a chance to cook a delicious dinner for your crew! Remember to bring some butter and salt along!</p>

<h2 id="ksivarsi-wilderness-area">K√§sivarsi Wilderness Area</h2>

<p>My favorite hiking destination in Finland is K√§sivarsi Wilderness Area. While I occasionally enjoy cruising down a well-groomed trail, nothing beats walking off-trail in a remote wilderness. While there‚Äôs a good trail system to explore parts of the area, my favorite thing is to take the seaplane to one of the lakes in the furthest corners of the area, next to the Norwegian border, and then hike my way back to Kilpisj√§rvi.</p>

<p>One good thing which came out of the COVID-19 Pandemic is that we now go hiking every Sunday with the family. All four of us look forward to the outing, and some rain in the forecast doesn‚Äôt cancel our plans. We have rain clothes, after all - and the kids are even happier as it allows them to jump in every puddle along the trail! Good thing that we life in the sunniest part of Finland and that it hasn‚Äôt rained a lot here yet.</p>

<p>The most import things for our family hikes are: Some breads as a snack, a M√ºsli bar treat which we share, some water or hot juice to drink and proper clothes for the occasion. As it gets warmer now in Vaasa, it‚Äôs nice to wear less - maybe a couple more weeks and I can slip on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a>!</p>

<p>Last Sunday we went to a close-by nature area, and hiked some two kilometres to a birdwatching tower. While the snow is gone since months (it was another terrible winter here in the south), spring comes late in this part of Finland and only during the past week the trees started to drive out the first buds and leaves. In another week everything will be over, and the trees will be green and summer will start!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49931073187/in/dateposted/" title="Layers"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49931073187_c82f947aff_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Layers" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>An important aspect of our family hikes is to keep them short-ish and interesting. Both kids much prefer forest trails to gravel roads, and around 2 km one-way seems a good distance for us right now - with a break and then another 2 km back to the start. We parents also prefer the forest trails, they feel much nicer because you‚Äôre ‚Äúcloser‚Äù to nature. On this hike there were also no Mosquitos, and only little noise pollution from the nearby roads.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49930250643/in/dateposted/" title="Green"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49930250643_3691e04f41_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Green" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There were surprisingly many families out on this trail - which is good to see, as it means more people start to value their local nature, and maybe become more engaged in protecting the environment.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49930765536/in/dateposted/" title="Dot"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49930765536_245705b8b8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dot" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the end it was a relaxed, good little hike. We saw a white-tailed eagle from the bird watching tower (even without my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/05/vortex-optics-viper-hd-binoculars.html">binoculars</a>!) and lots of smaller singing birds, which were merrily chirping in the green woods. Our little family hikes make us all feel better, and especially I really value these little adventures outdoors.</p>

<p>I started to get the first signs of depression last week, I have to admit. I especially feel bad because I lost around 90% of my income, I had to postpone the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/european-trail-days-2020.html">European Trail Days Festival</a> and many work trips, with other cooperations also falling through. I am not one to normally write and share such personal things, but I want to show you that while things are OK here (we can pay the bills and have food on the table each day) AND Social Media posts look like Life is A-OK, I still feel the negative consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic, and hence I decided to break with my normal approach and share these thoughts with you.</p>

<p>The first ‚Äúhint of a depression‚Äù is giving me the feeling that I wanna fix it by buying stuff, to get a quick dopamine hit of knowing of getting something new and shiny. However, I also know this does not work for me. If at all, it is a very brief dopamine hit, then I start to check tracking updates a couple of times each day (which makes me more anxious), and when it then arrives I unpack it, smile, and am unhappy again. Shopping is not a sustainable fix for me, and I happy am pretty well able to refrain from shopping, also under normal circumstances.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48753720577/in/dateposted/" title="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48753720577_1b04a4e48e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With going outdoors also being more difficult right now - both kids are at home, my wife is working from home and as I‚Äôm basically unemployed (I am finishing up a lot of projects, though) - it is also not easy for me to go backpacking, which usually is my medicine to these situations. I can‚Äôt go out to shoot videos or go hiking, as I have to take care of the kids. At 4 and 8 they are well able to take mostly care of themselves and they play nicely together, but every 15 to 45 minutes there is a ‚ÄúDad‚Äù call which needs attention. And with me being the one who has little paying work, I take care of them.</p>

<p>Now as you might know, I got back into painting miniatures and playing tabletop and boardgames several years ago, and this is actually something which helps me to cope. In the evenings (and sometimes also during the day) I go to my hobby room, where I have a nice painting corner set up, and then I delve into painting terrain or miniatures. I can get lost in the little details, forget about the bad things, and have fun and relaxation while painting. I also got a 3D Printer which is a nice new toy, but also a lot of work. This hobby does give me happiness and keeps me busy, which is positive.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49886519247/in/dateposted/" title="Hobbying away."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49886519247_02c6e64e43_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Hobbying away." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Another thing which usually helps me is to do sports, like trailrunning. Sadly I have had very little motivation to put <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">my running clothes and shoes</a> on and go for a 5 or 10 km run in the nearby forest. After a long day taking care of the kids and doing some work, there‚Äôs just little power left to motivate myself to go outside. Which is a shame, because I know it would make me feel much better, if I did so.</p>

<p>So, I really miss being outdoors. Under normal circumstances I am skiing, backpacking or bikepacking &amp; packrafting once a month for a week, but right now we do not have normal circumstances. By the way, I fully support Lockdown measures and social distancing, I think the Finnish government is doing a tremendous job of keeping the population safe and healthy. But yeah, I miss not being able to go hiking with my best friend - we planned to go hiking in Luxembourg or Belgium right about now - or that my ski seasons was cut so short.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49716645042/in/dateposted/" title="Happy!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49716645042_fc0974f19e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Happy!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On the positive side of this Pandemic, it‚Äôs really great to sleep till 8:00 in the morning - usually we have to get up earlier to bring kids to school and kindergarden, and being able to sleep ‚Äúlong‚Äù and have a relaxed breakfast and a slow start into the day is positive. But that‚Äôs really about the positive things I can think of. Well, there‚Äôs less pollution from air traffic, but that‚Äôs about it.</p>

<p>So, all this is more of a way to say: While Social Media <em>might</em> give the impression that everything is great with me (I try not to give that impression, but pretty photos might give it nevertheless), the truth is that I also feel the consequences of this situation mentally, but that thanks to my family and my indoors hobbies I am coping alright. I miss going on backpacking trips and travelling, but I do think it is necessary to protect the people who are at risk. I hope that it will be soon possible to go outdoors sort-of-normally, at the latest this summer, and that I will have a great autumn backpacking trip with my best friend - and I hope that for all people who love &amp; need the outdoors for their mental wellbeing like me.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a big fan of keeping my gear sorted on my hikes, and a problem I encountered on many trips in the past is that I miss a bag or pouch for essential stuff which I wanna keep close but not really in my pockets or inside my backpack. Enter the fanny pack (<em>or a bum bag in British English</em>). Since seven plus years <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/10/shoulder-and-multi-use-packs-for-hiking-and-backpacking.html">I use different kinds of shoulder and fanny packs</a>, so the <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/beipack/">HUCKEPACKS beiPACK</a> is a logical addition to my HUCKEPACKS Fanboy collection. On my hike in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/09/impressions-from-the-far-north.html">Hammastunturi</a> last autumn üçÇ I still used a <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/hipbelt-pocket/">HUCKEPACKS Hipbelt Pocket</a> to store essentials, but now that I have upgraded to the more spacious beiPACK I think the Hipbelt Pocket will only come out to play as a ‚Ä¶ Hipbelt pocket =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49862091341/in/dateposted/" title="beiPACK and Hipbelt Pocket 02"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49862091341_54fb62f1b4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="beiPACK and Hipbelt Pocket 02" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now while theoretically the beiPACK is double the volume of the Hipbelt Pocket, I have found it fits actually more than double the content (as for how much, <a href="https://youtu.be/bZIgPo1rubg">watch the Video</a> above!). At 74 g with the strap (or 42 g without it) the beiPACK is not much heavier than a Hipbelt Pocket, but the possibility to load it up with a map, snacks, an SUL hardshell and a Pocket camera makes it a lot more useable for me - especially as a wee summit pack which I can load up with the aforementioned gear at camp and then head out to explore the hills and forests around my ‚õ∫Ô∏è</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49861560053/in/dateposted/" title="Closed beiPACK"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49861560053_bd657dce67_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Closed beiPACK" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49861559858/in/dateposted/" title="beiPACK top view"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49861559858_5f84dd3241_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="beiPACK top view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49861559738/in/dateposted/" title="beiPACK and Hipbelt Pocket 03"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49861559738_290980ef25_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="beiPACK and Hipbelt Pocket 03" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The beiPACK also comes with a flat inside pocket, which is where I keep my passport, notebook + pen and other documents, and a large main compartment. It‚Äôs waterproof and has a comfortable 25 mm wide strap with durable and easy-to-use buckles, which obviously can be totally removed if you decide to carry it in front of your chest, connected to your pack. You also can strap it around your pack, if you don‚Äôt like to carry it around your shoulders (which is my preferred way to carry it).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49862404742/in/dateposted/" title="Happy Hiker!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49862404742_59be7a5eca_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Happy Hiker!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I especially love the limited edition <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/specials/beipack-special/">beiPACK Special</a> series, where a dozen different beiPACKS in various materials and colours are available. It definitely wasn‚Äôt easy to pick a colour I have to say, but I am super happy with the darkgreen woven DCF version I picked üòä So if you have the problem of having small items in your pockets and flying around in your pack, solve the problem by getting a beiPACK!</p>

<p>Air traffic is now 29% of what it was pre-COVID-19, trains and busses are also substantially less frequent, cars are standing at home unused, and on the other side you have National Parks, Wilderness Areas and our beautiful outdoors which is recovering, with animals appearing where they previously have been seen long ago and air pollution in cities is dropping, too. At home we also get busy thinking about the outdoors, and our post-poned outdoor adventures. I‚Äôm no different, and while I am sad about the cancelled ski trips this spring, I‚Äôm looking forward to the hiking, packrafting and bikepacking trips in the not-too-distant future!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49812125413/in/dateposted-public/" title="Planning"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49812125413_7ab1c1908b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Planning" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now, as I expect that planes will remain grounded (AMAZING for the environment and our #ClimateCrisis) I will continue to travel more by train and bus. I love to travel by train: You can walk around while the train rides, eat in the train restaurant when you get hungry, play games, the kids can jump around on the playground in the kids waggon, there‚Äôs functional toilets which are not the size of a shoebox, watch movies on Youtube or surf the internet, and one of the best things: Simply watch out of the window and observe the environment which passes you by. In Europe you can get quickly and affordably to most corners of the continent, and where the train tracks stop there‚Äôs usually a bus waiting to take you to the next destination.</p>

<p>Well, I currently also am stuck at home (relaxing while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwYqDhtJj1x3DXy4IPCxL2A/">painting tabletop Miniatures and terrain</a>) and besides the occasional day hike with the family or cycling along the coast I am already pondering where to go in the summer and autumn. It‚Äôs very, very likely in Finland, with small chances of heading to close-by Norway and Sweden, but unlikely to be further away. <strong>But hey!</strong> <strong>Finland is AWESOME!</strong> Beautiful, crystal-clear lakes for paddling, amazing forests full of tasty bilberries, soft trails and great camping spots, and once autumn comes by the beautiful colours of nature will delight us!</p>

<p>The best thing that you can do right now, if you‚Äôre under lockdown and can not go wild camping, is to plan that next trip. <em>Anticipation is the greatest joy</em>, as we say in German. Get in a great mood by taking out your wish list of local, national trails you wanna hike or cycle, grab some maps and start planning. And not just the hike, also on how you get there (also if schedules might not yet be that reliable, so keep that in mind) - and remember my chorus of praise for trains above üòâ And as you have had to post-pone a few hikes, maybe also stay at a local B&amp;B or Hostel at the end of your backpacking trip, as a warm shower and a tasty meal before travelling home is what you deserve, and the local entrepreneurs will be grateful for your support after months of empty rooms.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs it. Planning that next hike helps you keep a positive outlook on this situation, and going over maps and pondering what to eat (and maybe ordering already some food for that trip) helps you to spend your time productively instead of watching Netflix. Maybe plan a hike that is 90% off-trail! Or a hike which visits all the sights you wanted to visit &amp; see already since a long time! Or a hike where you come out at a great Pizza place at the end üçï ü§ó Right now there‚Äôs enough time to plan that next hike in great detail, and get the food &amp; supplies you need for it, so that when you can get back outdoors, <strong>you are ready!</strong></p>

<p>In that sense: Stay healthy, wash your hands and plan that next outdoor trip!</p>

<h2 id="carrying-more-stuff-from-home">Carrying more stuff from home</h2>

<p>As <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/ultralight/">Ultralight Backpackers</a> we try to minimize the amount of stuff we carry into the outdoors, so that the hiking part of our trip is more enjoyable. In the minds of many they envision us as freezing at night, getting wet in the rain, and forgoing any and all comfort in our pursuit to save some weight on our backs. <strong>That is nonsense.</strong> Ultralight backpackers sleep warm and comfortable, stay dry in the rain, and carry comfortable backpacks and clothes on their trips. The one thing we rarely (<em>never?</em>) carry, however, is a chair. Not an <em>‚Äúultralight‚Äù</em> one that‚Äôs <em>‚Äúonly‚Äù</em> 510 g, nor a stool which is 350 g. That‚Äôs a substantial amount of extra weight to carry around the whole day, just so that you could sit down for a while in the evening in camp. We just sit on the ground.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49752951781/in/dateposted-public/" title="BTR Stool"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49752951781_ec568dfe81_b.jpg" width="1024" height="499" alt="BTR Stool" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="whats-wrong-with-sitting-on-the-ground">What‚Äôs wrong with sitting on the ground?</h2>

<p>The idea of carrying a chair into nature is so strange to me, but then I also am standing at home at my desk since 10+ year. If you walk three kilometres from the bus stop to the campground and the plan is to sit till midnight at the campfire üî• and drink beer, then yeah, maybe a chair is ok. But for a backpacking trip? Hardly. I simply don‚Äôt get why people would want to carry a chair on a backpacking trip, when sitting on the ground, on a pad or inside your tent porch, does an absolutely great job of keeping your ass dry and comfortable. Do you really need to have a chair in which you can lean back? Why not just lay down?</p>

<p>During breaks I often don‚Äôt even bother taking out a pad, and just sit down on the soft ground next to the trail, or a fallen tree if it presents itself. Comfortable. Easy. Simple. Fast. No extra weight. No assembly required.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49752957351/in/dateposted-public/" title="GearJunkie Chairs"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49752957351_569c6734e1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="925" alt="GearJunkie Chairs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="i-like-rocks-fallen-trees-and-my-ccf-pad">I like rocks, fallen trees and my CCF pad</h2>

<p>Maybe I‚Äôm wrong with my opinion, and sitting on a chair in the outdoors is actually far superior to sitting on my piece of <a href="https://bit.ly/2wqpWPH">ZLite</a> or <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/exped-flexmat-plus-sleeping-mat/?pid=10239">Flexmat</a>, a fallen tree, a rock or in my tent porch. Who knows - I certainly don‚Äôt, as I don‚Äôt own any outdoor backpacking chair and so can not speak about the benefit of sitting in one. It does, however, feel like a fad and an absolutely unnecessary item to carry into the outdoors. It feels like one of the Instagram-able items you take along on your hike, just so that you can post a photo of you sitting like at home, just in nature. For the ‚Äògram, and not because it is more enjoyable.</p>

<p>And maybe that is my main problem - that people try to make nature feel more like home. I go outdoors to be away from home, experience the fresh wind on my face, hear the birds singing, feel the soft ground under my feet. The last thing on my mind, since I go actively outdoors since a dozen or so years again, is a chair. If along the trail there‚Äôs a nice bench with a good view, sure, I sit down on it, take a gulp of water and maybe some nuts, and then I continue. At camp I sit not that much, either. I move all the time, to get water, make fire or cook food, pitch the tarp and change into dry socks and clothes. I sit so little at camp, that carrying a comfort item like a hiking chair or stool into nature feels so utterly unnecessary to me, that I wonder if other people sit for hours in camp? After a day of hiking, once I have ate and took the last photos of the day, I am happy to simply lay down under my quilt, and fall asleep.</p>

<p><em>Do I have it all wrong?</em> Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/">Facebook</a> if I should try a hiking chair or stool, and give my arse the comfort it deserves after a day on the trail üòÉ</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Content Creators, Photographers and Small- and Medium-Sized Businesses suffer a lot under the current Corona Virus Pandemic. Here are my tips on how you can help them during these difficult times.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49716642567/in/dateposted-public/" title="The Start"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49716642567_15d2daaa60_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Start" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>While governments across the globe sign ‚ÄúRescue Packages‚Äù into law, these millions and billions of ‚Ç¨¬£$ do not end up in the hands of the people who most suffer from this loss of income. Nope, it goes to large, multinational firms and you, me and my entrepreneur colleagues, we still sit in front of a hill of invoices which want to be paid - and then there‚Äôs the thing with rent for the flat and food.</p>

<p><em>BUT</em> there are ways you can support your favourite local shops, Youtube channels and outdoor blogs: Use their Affiliate Links when you shop. Because lets realize: Those of us who are fortunate enough to be able to <em>work from home</em> still have an income, and might need to buy some things to make life at home more bearable, or you simply have enough time now to ponder which backpack to purchase for that next trip when we are allowed to go out again! So if there is an online content creator you really enjoy, support her or him! Check their affiliate links from their content, even ask them for them if you don‚Äôt find them and then click on them before you order something online. And if they have a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">Patreon</a>, maybe check it out and see if you can support them with a few ‚Ç¨$¬£ every month.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49716327811/in/dateposted-public/" title="Dusk"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49716327811_0353c656f1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dusk" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With local entrepreneurs &amp; shops you could either purchase things from their online shops or call in and order the things you need for take-away. Many Caf√©‚Äôs, restaurants and small shops offer this service during this crisis, and it helps them to survive in these times where everything which is not an essential business has to shut down and close their doors. Especially those entrepreneurs which need to pay rent for their shop are having a lot of stress and sorrow, as they could lose their businesses if they are not able to pay the rent. I really hope that there are many rent lords who will not collect rent in these times, and let normal people and businesses not end up on the street.</p>

<p>As for travel businesses like Hostels, Hotels and Tour Operators - and I have many friends who operate such businesses and I can tell you that they are severely affected - you could book a trip or reserve a room for when this Pandemic is set to calm down. If you‚Äôre optimistic that could be for the autumn, in September or October, or if you think this Pandemic will last longer, then maybe for next winter or spring. As I was just up North I can tell you that the <a href="https://sevenfellshostel.fi">7 Fells Hostel</a>, the <a href="https://hetan-majatalo.fi">Hetan Majatalo</a> and the <a href="https://www.yllaslodge.com">Yll√§s Lodge</a> really would appreciate your support during this time, as are my friends from <a href="https://adventurepartners.fi">Adventure Partners</a>, <a href="https://blissadventure.fi/">Bliss Adventures</a> and <a href="https://www.outdoorpassion.fi">Outdoor Passion Finland</a>.</p>

<p>If you were planning to attend a <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Kurse-und-Touren:::21.html?MODsid=99c87c38cddd237c6eed6767d3a35265">packrafting</a>, <a href="https://andrewskurka.com/guided-trips/">backpacking</a> or <a href="http://www.davidlintern.com/tuition-scotland">photography course</a> which got post-poned or cancelled, book a course to a later date - either in the autumn or next spring. Because: Looking forward to your next trip is definitely something which is a positive thing in your life right now! And to be inspired for your next trip, why not <a href="https://shop.kelsey.co.uk/subscription/TGO?promo=TGO">take out a subscription</a> of your <a href="https://sidetracked.bigcartel.com/product/sidetracked-subscription-issue-17-18-19">favourite outdoor magazine</a>?</p>

<p><em>And here‚Äôs a dozen of shops with Affiliate Links from me which you can use if you need food, clothes, a backpack, camera gear or similar while you‚Äôre indoors and planning for the next trip into nature!</em></p>

<p><a href="http://tidd.ly/c2f0efeb">Bergzeit.de</a> is a fine online outdoor shop with a wide variety of gear, from skis to backpacking gear, and has a good Outlet if you‚Äôre looking for deals!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://awesome-maps.com?ref=5bf3c25a56dc2" title="Awesome Maps made my Man Cave prettier!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49741624443_b3b9ca2e90_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Awesome Maps made my Man Cave prettier!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Don‚Äôt want to go to the shop to buy stuff? With the <a href="http://bit.ly/2L5feSO">ANYCUBIC PHOTON S 3D Printer</a> you can print your own items (linelocs, <a href="http://instagram.com/skullsandpaints/">miniatures</a> and tent stakes come to mind).</p>

<p>And now lets look at some of my favourite brands and their online offerings!</p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/2ORYUpk">Black Diamond</a> makes my favourite Windjacket, the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Alpine Start Hoody</a>, and they just launched a new line of approach shoes which are really good for hiking in the mountains, too.</p>

<p>Talking of shoes, <a href="https://www.lunasandals.com?rfsn=35669.8168e">Luna Sandals</a> makes my favourite sandals, the Luna OSO (Flaco). They even have a special Edition of that shoe available right now, if you like it colourful!</p>

<p>If I‚Äôm not wearing Sandals then you will find <a href="https://bit.ly/3dT91WV">La Sportiva</a> shoes on my feet. I‚Äôm a La Sportiva Ambassador since several years and am really happy to have these fantastic shoes and ski boots on my feet during my adventures, like the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/la-sportiva-crossover-2-dot-0-gtx.html">La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX</a>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm also a huge <a href="http://bit.ly/2qV5lwl">Patagonia</a> fan as the brand makes sustainable, durable and high-quality outdoor apparel and gear, while also taking care of the environment and its employees. A brand definitely worth supporting during these times.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre still in need of a ultralight backpack, take a look at what <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de">HUCKEPACKS</a> has to offer. The PHOENIX Lite is currently my favourite backpack, and the new <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/specials/beipack-special/">BEI Pack</a> is a really cool looking fanny pack! This small cottage definitely needs your support right now, so if you can support them - DO IT!</p>

<p>And finally, as a Houdini Friend you won‚Äôt be too surprised that I recommend their apparel, too. <a href="http://houdinisportswear.com/">Houdini Sportwear</a> is with a few exemptions pretty much all I wear - right now for example my pants, shirt and fleece jacket are from them, and it are garments that I wear day-in, day-out, at home, in the city and outdoors. All Houdini garments this season are <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/en-eu/sustainability/sustainability-status-100">100% recycled, recyclable, renewable, biodegradable or Bluesign certified</a> and I love their simple aesthetic and functional cuts.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago I wrote about <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/hiking-and-travel-during-covid-19.html">Hiking and Travel during COVID-19</a>, and now I‚Äôm back and want to share my experiences with you of how it was to travel in this time and age. In case you wonder: Yes, <strong>this was a work trip</strong>. I went on this trip because it means I can put food on the table for April and May. It is the only larger income for the foreseeable future, and yes, my family and me were discussing long and in-depth if I should go. Deep inside I probably hoped that OnniBus would just cancel the journey to Levi, then I‚Äôd be able to easily postpone the trip. But I kept on checking their website, and on the evening of the 19th of March it was clear: My Bus to Lapland rides, and my buses south too. So I put the last things into my Pulka, strapped the skis on top, filled up my Thermos with hot juice and went to the Bus Station.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49720079711/in/dateposted-public/" title="COVID-19 Bus Selfie"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49720079711_1ecf6aedb0_b.jpg" width="769" height="1024" alt="COVID-19 Bus Selfie" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My Bus from Vaasa left at 2:30 in the middle of the night, and with me were another five or six people on the bus - all well spaced out. I put on my <a href="https://amzn.to/3dEOEN7">noise-cancelling headphones</a>, put the relaxing sound of a rainy night playing, and fell asleep. I awoke at 7:00 in the morning in Oulu, where I had an hour time before my Bus to Levi would leave. The sun was shining outside, it was -7¬∞C and inside in the waiting hall of the bus station were four other people. Everyone was sitting on his or her own bench, with several meters of distance between us. As I was going to sit another 9 hours in the Bus I pulled my Pulka to the bus platform and started walking up and down in the sun.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49719505363/in/dateposted-public/" title="Oulu Matkakeskus"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49719505363_34eacd27c9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Oulu Matkakeskus" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the Bus to Levi we were a few more people - maybe between ten and twelve. Again there were several rows distance between each passenger, and at the few longer stops everyone let the others disembark with a lot of distance. People stayed away from each other, and no one was wearing face-masks. As we reached the border with Sweden after Kemi you could see the border guards stoping cars which tried to pass between Finland and Sweden, something I have not seen ever before.</p>

<p>As I arrived in Levi I was surprised about the bustle in town. The lifts were operating, people were out skiing, fatbiking, and going for a stroll in the beautiful sunny weather. I waited 10 Minutes for my Bus for Hetta, and we were a total of three passengers on this Bus. Then, finally, at almost 17 o‚Äôclock I had arrived in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/04/hetta-winter-adventures-in-finnish-lapland.html">Hetta</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49715782283/in/dateposted-public/" title="Hetan Majatalo"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49715782283_ed3bc81a4a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hetan Majatalo" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This part of the journey worked surprisingly well. I was happy to be in sunny Lapland, with cold and sunny weather in the forecast. I was looking forward to go <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/impressions-from-the-hetta-pallas-hiking-trail.html">skiing on the Hetta - Pallas Trail</a>, and leave this crazy situation behind me for a while at least.</p>

<p>The next morning I left Hetta, and loved skiing on the XC tracks. It was exhausting, but the sun was shining, there was little wind, and the views were great. My phone was in Airplane mode, both so it preserved battery and that I‚Äôm not bothered by what is going on elsewhere on this planet üåç. For the next days I had a wonderful time (being happily ignorant of developments in Finland and elsewhere) although it also has been <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-XgJhSDDOy/">utterly exhausting</a> at times.</p>

<p>On Tuesday I arrived at the rustic Montellin Maja hut, and thought it would be a good time to check my Emails. That‚Äôs where the stress started: I had several messages from OnniBus that they decided to cancel all Ski Busses from Levi &amp; Yll√§s to the south, BUT there was one Bus still going - you needed to be in touch if you wanted to get a seat on it. A few stressful hours ensued, while I was skiing in windy &amp; sunny weather first to the large Nammalakuru Hut and then onwards to the Rihmakuru Kota. As I arrived at the latter I had received a reply that I was rebooked on the Bus on Saturday morning going south, and so I could enjoy this wonderful Kota with it‚Äôs <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel/status/1242769710699159552">amazing tiny stove</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49715787928/in/dateposted-public/" title="Hannunkuru Sauna"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49715787928_ac3c16c7a9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hannunkuru Sauna" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The next few days I spent skiing and fatbiking in Yll√§s while enjoying the hospitality of the <a href="https://sevenfellshostel.fi/">7 Fells Hostel</a>. On Saturday morning I took a Taxi to the Bus Stop, and was happy to see that there were a few more travellers making the journey south. That meant at least the bus was not cancelled. <em>Or that‚Äôs what we thought.</em> It was 10:20 and there was no Bus in sight. 10:30, still no Bus. 10:40, no Bus. A Blizzard was raging at the Bus Stop, and it was cold. We were wondering with the other passengers what is going on - it‚Äôs just a short 16 km to Levi, and such a delay seemed very strange. Was the Bus coming?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49720358282/in/dateposted-public/" title="Yll√§s OnniBus Stop"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49720358282_d639ceb6d0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Yll√§s OnniBus Stop" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At 11:20, an hour late, the OnniBus rolled to the Bus Stop. Everyone was reliefed and smiling - we would get home at last! We loaded all our stuff inside, and off we were. There still was lots of space - the next passengers to me sat three rows behind me - and somehow we also arrived not too late in Oulu. I saw the train going to Sein√§joki stand already at the platform, and decided to try to catch it, even if I only had a ticket for Sunday night on the same train. I got in, stored all my stuff, and sat down alone as the only passenger in the whole waggon. My ticket was accepted with a smile and several hours later I disembarked in Sein√§joki. I waited a short while alone on the platform while Dusk was painting the sky in beautiful hues of orange, red and blue, till my train to Vaasa arrived. The same thing again - I was the only passenger in the whole waggon, and had a friendly chat with the conductress. I arrived well back in Vaasa at home, kissed my kids good night after over a week, and had a relaxed evening with my wife. But <strong>I wouldn‚Äôt go on such a trip again under these circumstances.</strong></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49720326892/in/dateposted-public/" title="Sein√§joki Railway Station"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49720326892_663093297c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sein√§joki Railway Station" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>What would have been a fabulous trip and an amazing experience under normal circumstances warped into a stressful and uncertain trip during this COVID-19 Pandemic. Being reliant on Public Transportation in these times is highly unreliable, and adds a level of stress which I wouldn‚Äôt want to experience when I go on a trip. Being uncertain about if you get home, or when and how, just distracts from your enjoyment of the nature and landscape you went to explore &amp; experience. As the COVID-19 Pandemic is set to limit travels (in Finland) at least till the end of May I know that I will not go anywhere where I can not get on my bike from the front of my house, or where I can hike or paddle easily.</p>

<p>Going outdoors is a place for me where I want to be able to recuperate, and even if I can stay offline and shut out the rest of the world, if you need to get home with the bus or train afterwards that thought will stick with you, even as your phone stays in Flight Mode. So my conclusion is simple: Travelling during the COVID-19 pandemic, even within your own country - is not worth it. Stay local, explore your own backyard forests and lakes, and use your bike, feet and <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Neu/Anfibio-Rebel-2K::889.html">packraft</a> to get to new places. The hills will still be there when this Pandemic has passed, and you will enjoy them a lot more than now, in these uncertain times. And why not <a href="http://tidd.ly/f2bcba3e">camp in the garden this Eastern</a> instead of travelling far?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Hetta-Pallas cross country skiing trail has been for a very long time on my wish list, and amid the current chaos I was able to escape to the farthest North of Finland and ski this breathtakingly beautiful trail. <em>Here are my first impressions.</em></p>

<p>I started this trip in Hetta, which took me around 16 hours to travel to. A relaxing and cozy night at the Hetan Majatalo was spent in this calm village, and the next morning my Pulka and me started on the trail south towards Pallas, under beautiful sunshine.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49715799903/in/dateposted-public/" title="Break from the wind"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49715799903_b1db9d0528_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Break from the wind" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The 2nd day was one of the most exhausting days outdoors in memory. I was absolutely destroyed after I arrived at Pahakuru Hut. But nature‚Äôs lightshow made up for it rather well.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49715787928/in/dateposted-public/" title="Hannunkuru Sauna"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49715787928_ac3c16c7a9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hannunkuru Sauna" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That the outside world also had an effect on this remote location was evident also in the middle of the trail.</p>

<p>In the end it was a beautiful trip, and I can‚Äôt wait to write it down and share it with you. It was exhausting, with a relentless wind which robbed me of much joy on some days, and the lingering worry of ‚Äú<em>Do I get back home?</em>‚Äù as buses and trains were cancelled. In the end I had a lot of luck and thanks to a very kind couple got a ride from the middle of nowhere to Yll√§s, where I spent another few days skiing and Fatbiking before I returned home to Vaasa.</p>

<h2 id="class-of-2020">Class of 2020</h2>

<p>Mid-March is usually a time where many thru-hikers from Europe, Australia and Asia board a plane to head to the USA üá∫üá∏, Mexico üá≤üáΩ or Canada üá®üá¶ to thru-hike one of the three long-distance trails in North America: The Pacific Crest Trail, the Appalachian Trail and the Continental Divide Trail. With the COVID-19 Pandemic, however, this plan is looking more and more unrealistic: The USA is no longer allowing Europeans and other nationals into their country, and Mexico and Canada might follow suit at any time - let alone the question if you get a flight or plane ticket to either country right now.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49669238126/in/dateposted-public/" title="Foggy Path - Photo by Dave on Unsplash"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49669238126_e290b0249c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="698" alt="Foggy Path | Photo by Dave on Unsplash" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As hopeful as one might be and for example plan to post-pone the thru-hike to a later starting date, or to travel first to Mexico for two weeks of ‚Äú<em>quarantine holidays</em>‚Äù and then to enter the USA, personally I think it is best to post-pone the whole thru-hike till 2021. The three big trails won‚Äôt run away, and I am sure that employers, family, partners and friends are understandable and emphatic about the difficult decision to postpone a 2020 thru-hike.</p>

<p>Because: Gatherings of 10+ people are not recommended in the USA, governments across the world urge people to avoid all nonessential travel, and also restaurants and other stores along the AT, CDT and PCT have closed for the time being, which will make it difficult to resupply in towns. Or <a href="https://thetrek.co/right-start-thru-hike-coronavirus-outbreak/">as Maggie puts it</a>: ‚Äú<em>If potential travel, quarantine, and amenity closures don‚Äôt make the choice for you, you‚Äôll have to decide if it‚Äôs the morally sound thing to do.</em>‚Äù She did, and cancelled her 2020 PCT thru-hike. If you still plan to go ahead, consider these <a href="https://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/permits/three-covid-19-messages-to-all-pct-long-distance-permit-holders/">three messages to all Long-Distance Permit Holders</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hike-local">Hike Local</h2>

<p>Some governments (the German and Finnish one, for example) are smart enough to recommend daily walks at the fresh air (avoiding large amounts of people and such, obviously üòä). That‚Äôs perfect for us hikers, cyclists and backpackers, I feel, and allows us to discover our immediate surroundings on a long walk or an Overnighter (some call it a <a href="https://amzn.to/2WwaLiH">Microadventure</a>!). Because when was the last time that you went out to explore what lays behind your town and fields? I know for me it‚Äôs been a while, so this situation where you now can not head to the Pub or Caf√© to meet friends means you can go for a relaxing walk in nature. I still believe that nature is one of the best places to get new ideas and to calm down. Obviously cycling or going for a packrafting or <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/06/sup-adventures-in-the-kvarken-archipelago.html">SUP trip</a>, weather permitting, are all perfect ways to go explore locally, too. Thinking of it, for those living at the coast or near a water body, this COVID-19 Pandemic might be the perfect excuse to <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de">loan or buy a packraft</a>, especially if you already explore your local region on foot and know every tree!</p>

<p>By the way, if you have little time to hike because you should commute to work - maybe you can ‚Äúhike‚Äù or cycle to work instead of taking the train or bus? That way you get the recommended ‚Äúoutside‚Äù time, and also avoid during your commute larger groups of people.</p>

<h2 id="ski-touring">Ski touring?!</h2>

<p>‚Å£As ski resorts around the world continue to close down, and governments (like in Austria) recommend that you are not going ski touring, climbing or hiking, the question remains if you should cancel all your mountain activities. In my opinion, if you know there‚Äôs a 100% safe ski (or hiking) tour, the avalanche forecast says everything is A-OK, and you‚Äôre not breaking any laws, then head to the mountains to enjoy the little snow we had this winter. Just make sure to be respectful of your local laws &amp; recommendations, other people, and avoid injuries at all costs - it always is better to turn around instead of risking your life. Because with hospitals expected to stay busy with ill patients, every effort should be made to avoid injuries.‚†Ä</p>

<h2 id="stay-safe--wash-your-hands">Stay safe &amp; wash your hands</h2>

<p>In the end you have to make decisions that are safe for everyone. I want to encourage you to see the positive effect of this pandemic, which is that you can get to know &amp; explore your local outdoors, and that you take the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public">recommended precautions</a> to safeguard the health and safety of yourself and others around you, while still pursuing your favourite outdoor activity - or discover a new one.</p>

<p>When I started Hiking in Finland in 2009 I soon started to network with like-minded hikers here in Europe and elsewhere. Going outdoors and sharing great experiences is just better than going alone, and in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/06/the-ul-fellowship.html">2010 the Nordic Lightpackers set out on a hike in V√•l√•dalen</a>. It was an amazing experience, and two years later I again met ‚Äústrangers from the internet‚Äù for the first <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/09/ultralight-summit-daytrippin.html">Ultralight Summit</a> in Slovenia.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7783257680/in/album-72157630936718764/" title="Happy Times!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/8437/7783257680_a09eb45ba8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Happy Times!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In 2013 the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/01/koli-national-park.html">2nd Ultralight Summit</a> took place in Finland and despite the weather we had a great time hiking. These meet-ups gave me the feeling that it‚Äôs great to meet like-minded people, people who share the same passion of going outdoors, are interested in trying new things, and who are fun to be around. Fast-forward to 2020 and the <a href="http://traildays.eu">European Trail Days</a>! A social, relaxed Festival where you can meet all your digital and real-life friends at a beautiful spot in Sweden, stroll over our small fair and check our gear from companies like Locus Gear, Liteway Equipment, Sierra Designs and others, eat tasty, locally produced ice cream and sit by the camp fire and swap stories from your hikes with friends!</p>

<h2 id="the-location">The Location</h2>

<p>The inaugural European Trail Days will take place at the Glassbonden Farm next to the Vinde√§lven river. Glassbonden is a household name in the region for their delicious, locally produced ice cream (made from the cow‚Äôs milk which will graze around the Festival area!) and we‚Äôre super-excited to work with them. One of the best things about the location most certainly is that you can hike in two days from the centre of Ume√• to it, on the <a href="https://www.umea.se/download/18.472dbf4213f09f32875c6c7/1377178225690/Tavelsj√∂rivblad%20E.pdf">Tavelsj√∂leden Trail</a>. The massive field will hold all the Tarps, Pyramide shelters and tents from the people who join us for a night or two, as well as the booths from all the cool brands which join us, Workshops, the stage and the campfire area! On the river you can try packrafting, in the forest you can learn how to hang a hammock correctly and there‚Äôs plenty of cool trails and gravel roads for hiking and cycling. Also, the Vindel√§lven river is one of Sweden‚Äôs best fishing rivers with brown trout and other native fish, so bring your fishing rod!</p>

<h2 id="the-programme">The Programme</h2>

<p>For the European Trail Days we decided we need a program, and one which is really interesting to new and old hikers &amp; backpackers alike. We‚Äôre very lucky that we were able to secure an amazing set of speakers for the European Trail Days:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Glen Van Peski</strong>, Founder of Gossamer Gear</li>
  <li><strong>Linda √Ökerberg</strong>, Sweden South to North thru-hike and PCT Finisher</li>
  <li><strong>Chris Townsend</strong>, needs no introduction! Triple Crowner and finisher of a host of long-distance trails</li>
  <li><strong>J√∂rgen Johansson</strong>, The founder of the <em>‚Äú3 for 3‚Äù</em> Idea and one of Sweden‚Äôs earliest UL backpacking proponents</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these wonderful people also will host their own Workshops, so if you want to get some tips from Linda about hiking in Sweden or check out what Glen carries in his backpack, sign up for one of those, too! Speaking of workshops, I already can tease that there‚Äôs going to be a Workshop about packrafting and one about lightweight food and stoves, so if you want to keep up-to-date on these keep an eye on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/traildaysEU">Facebook page</a> as that‚Äôs where we announce these things (they also go up on the Website, <a href="http://traildays.eu/">traildays.eu</a>, if you‚Äôre not on Facebook).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49595965557/in/dateposted-public/" title="European Trail Days 2020"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49595965557_47453345ee_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="European Trail Days 2020" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In addition to Keynotes and the Workshops we will have a cozy little fair with a bunch of very cool outdoor and ultralight brands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Locus Gear from Japan</li>
  <li>Liteway Equipment from Ukraine</li>
  <li>Packraft Sverige from Sweden</li>
  <li>Hiker Haus from Germany</li>
  <li>Sierra Designs from the USA</li>
  <li>Gossamer Gear from the USA</li>
  <li>Six Moon Designs from the USA</li>
  <li>Backpackinglight.se from Sweden</li>
</ul>

<p>I can tell you, there‚Äôs several more that are coming, but haven‚Äôt confirmed 100% yet, but it will be really cool to see all the shiny UL Gear in person and talk with the makers!</p>

<p><strong>AND</strong> that‚Äôs still not all, as we aim to have a Concert from a local band on Saturday night, there‚Äôs going to be a Camp &amp; Chill area where you can sit around the campfire and socialize, we will have every day a ‚Äú<em>Solo Hiker Meet-up</em>‚Äù where you can meet other attendants, and some more stuff which I‚Äôm working on! We also have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/traildaysEU/posts/149279129876488?__xts__[0]=68.ARAS5u8DDCpRT-hCKAFfWYYSueDqfSP0WoR6_KBCEvfxU6dVI0Q0qkt8s7c2kb11Vju-fBx36KtStHGTFqtYUqOZazyR9SPalJfWWEV4hQhmuckzTWCee30WX5S9ykakN3gykkymMp3oXICG1-BHlJE87x14jcrLkJtMqAYX4jM0qPBR5GGFpi8m8Ri5VUbH2HFPXtAqsmWvnOhb6rqMxrONJg0GW3B-hK3RbY4W4j8N2Zd_S8laPVNJEGYuiDkL4DvccTQa78rnD4YIlXYlV8HGqHLrOH0xi5VtrHWeM_ZQL3sQnrIyAYqwzBLTIoA1t_7g0ezpjezWvWpndvwEWu-vhur7klQ&amp;__tn__=-R">delicious ice cream</a> and food is also available in case you don‚Äôt bring your own!</p>

<h2 id="im-coming-what-does-it-cost--where-can-i-sleep">I‚Äôm coming! What does it cost &amp; where can I sleep?</h2>

<p>Now the best thing: Most of the programme is <strong>FREE</strong>! Yes, all the Keynotes, checking out the fair, chilling at the campfire, and coming to the concert is free for everyone! The only costs you will have at the Festival is for camping, a mere 15‚Ç¨ for one night or 29‚Ç¨ for two. You can <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/european-trail-days-2020-tickets-84572284981">get your camping tickets online at our Ticket Site</a>, and that‚Äôs also where you can purchase your tickets for the different workshops. The camping fee goes to cover our costs for the rental of sanitary facilities, showers, and clean-up afterwards, so you directly benefit from it with having access to toilets and showers =) And as this is an outdoor Festival everyone brings their own shelter - be it a nice tent, an ultralight tarp and bivy bag, or a hammock - we have space for everything and everyone is welcome. If you prefer to sleep inside, please refer to our Website for other accommodation options!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36718255143/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Setting over the Baltic"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4397/36718255143_d83a46febd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Setting over the Baltic" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="getting-there-from-finland">Getting there from Finland</h2>

<p>I know there‚Äôs already a sizeable group of Finns coming to the Festival (join <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/kevytretkeilijat/">Kevytretkeilij√§t</a> to find out who!), and for us it‚Äôs the easiest to travel with the bus or train to Vaasa and then take the Wasaline ferry to Ume√•. When you have arrived in Sweden it is important to have booked the Bus transport from the harbour to Ume√• centre in advance (via the Wasaline website), otherwise you might end up stranded in the harbour. From the centre you either can hike directly via the <a href="https://www.umea.se/download/18.472dbf4213f09f32875c6c7/1377178225690/Tavelsj√∂rivblad%20E.pdf">Tavelsj√∂leden Trail</a> to the location (the 40 km trail should take around two days), or you can use public transportation to get to Glassbonden. Please <a href="http://traildays.eu/">refer to the Festival website</a> for information about this. Also, check out <a href="https://brianoutdoors.blog/2020/02/09/trip-planning-for-tavelsjoleden-and-european-trail-days-2020/">Brian Outdoors‚Äô Trip Planning article</a> as Brian will travel from Copenhagen to the Festival, and has done a lot of planning (which is also useful for those who come from central Europe and elsewhere!).</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I bought the <a href="https://www.lasportiva.com/en/crossover-20-gtx">La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX</a> in April 2018, and have used them since then pretty much on every backpacking trip: <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/microadventure-sipoonkorpi-national-park.html">Sipoonkorpi National Park</a>, at <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/09/camp-ousland.html">Camp Ousland</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/Zr6Ev1MFxBw">Backpacking in V√•l√•dalen</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/m8EstxnC8uQ">Backpacking in the Pyrenees</a> and also on my <a href="https://youtu.be/-AYVkZf61UE">backpacking trip in Hammastunturi Wilderness</a>. Additionally, in winter I also use these shoes all the time, so they easily have seen over 360 days of use so far, and I estimate that I have hiked over 1.500 km in them.</p>

<p>Shoes give you protection and grip on your hiking &amp; backpacking trips, and depending on the environment you are likely to pick different shoes: If I‚Äôm hiking in super-warm weather the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals OSO</a> are my pick, if I am in the mountains I usually opt for an <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/08/la-sportiva-tx2-review.html">approach shoe like the TX2</a>, and if I‚Äôm hiking in the autumn off-the-beaten track or expect wet and cold weather, then I put on the Crossover 2.0 GTX as they keep my feet drier and warmer than an unlined shoe.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Integrating a gaiter into a running shoe isn‚Äôt new, but La Sportiva has done an absolute amazing job with this shoe as it is durable in all aspects which matter to me.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>I have used this shoe for almost two years in autumn, winter and spring, in the Pyrenees, Finnish swamps, on snow &amp; asphalt and forest trails and have never found anything wrong with them. They‚Äôre always comfortable for my feet with a good fit in the heel, and the toe box is wide enough to accommodate my toes. The zipper holds up AMAZINGLY well, and still functions flawless. Also the heel - commonly an area where you see the wear &amp; tear first - is still without any damage. And I have been hiking a lot off-trail with these shoes, though shrubbery and whatnot, and the upper + gaiter still look in great shape.</p>

BUT how do you <em>‚Äúrecycle‚Äù</em> your La Sportiva shoes at the end of their life-cycle? In most countries shoes belong into the residual waste bin. Or if they still have some life left in them, you can drop them into a clothing recycling bin or donate them to a place which takes old clothes and shoes. You also can look for the shop or place which is part of the <a href="https://www.nike.com/sustainability">Reuse-A-Shoe program</a>, where they recycle your sneakers and transform them into Nike Grind material.</p>

<p>First things first: This is a Gore-Tex shoe, but that does not mean that I always had dry feet in them. If it are good, clear trails and it‚Äôs raining - dry feet, <em>mucho awesome</em>. Hiking through shrubbery, overgrown paths and through grass heavy with dew or wet from the rain, expect to have wet feet in a few minutes. The inner material also holds on to wetness well, so once the shoes are wet they are wet till you‚Äôre drying them over a stove. The wet shoes are not really a problem if you have some good <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/02/wrightsock-review.html">Merino Wool Socks</a> on and have the <em>hiking in wet shoes is not a problem</em> mind set, but it‚Äôs something I need to mention. Gore-Tex or waterproofness in shoes in general only goes so far really, but for me the benefit of having dry &amp; warm feet in the rain, when the trail conditions are right, outweigh the downside of hiking in a wet Gore-Tex shoe that needs longer to dry. I have found that drying the shoes overnight next to a wood stove is possible, and also in the tent they do dry out a wee bit if the air is not really saturated with moisture.</p>

<p>The shoe has a 10 mm Drop which is usually more than I like, but it‚Äôs still acceptable for me and as I have used these shoes so much I have got used to it. I also don‚Äôt particularly like that La Sportiva has used in the inner construction a material which holds moisture so long, I wish they would have used something more meshy that dries super-fast. But as this shoe is intended for winter trailrunning I get why they have made the shoe warmer instead of more breathable. It being a ‚Äúwarm‚Äù shoe also means that it isn‚Äôt really suitable to really warm weather - for me the ideal temperature to use the shoe is between -5¬∞c and 15¬∞C. If it is more than 15¬∞C I get really warm and sweaty feet, on the other side of the thermometer it‚Äôs not a problem to take the shoes down to -15¬∞C and still have toasty feet.</p>

<p>Grip wise these shoes are absolutely fantastic. Wet rocks in the Pyrenees, boulder-hoping down a field of scree: No problem. Traversing wet swamps: No Problem. Hiking on forest trails with roots and stones: Ideal terrain. Snow: Hi there, I‚Äôm at home here. The Crossover has superb grip thanks to it profile and the La Sportiva FriXion AT Sole. On wet boulders I am more careful than with a Vibram Megagrip sole, but I haven‚Äôt slipped on wet rocks yet. Given how much I have used these shoes I also am super-happy with the durability of the soles, they still have a few longer backpacking trips in them.</p>

<p>The integrated gaiter of the Crossover 2.0 is what gives this shoe a great advantage over normal trailrunning shoes in my opinions - the zipper is really well designed, the gaiter can be adjusted in width (tightness) at the top so it doesn‚Äôt slip down, and the material keeps rain, snow and debris like dirt and small stones out of your shoe. It also gives the shoe a great look, and I wear the shoe with the laces always done and only slip in and close the gaiter, ready to go.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I know that this shoe is made for trailrunning in winter, which is why it is made warmer. I‚Äôd like to see the same shoe - maybe with a Vibram Megagrip sole for even better grip on wet rocks - with a lighter inside construction which dries faster when it is wet, and I also can imagine it‚Äôd be good to decrease the Drop to 6 mm or less. This is more wishing La Sportiva building the ideal hiking shoe for wet weather, though üòÉ</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I have hiked for 9+ years in unlined shoes as that‚Äôs the Ultralight Backpacking Mantra. Light shoes without a (waterproof) liner are lighter and dry faster when wet. That is true, with the caveat that it depends on the material of the shoes how quickly they will dry. But I got so frustrated year after year that I had wet feet as soon as it rained a tiny wee bit or I went slightly off-trail, that I decided I want some more protection from water - hence I bought these shoes. I don‚Äôt look back at all. I love these shoes and will purchase a 2nd pair once these are nearing the end of their lifecycle, for me they really are a fantastic pair of shoes which helps me to keep my feet dry longer, with great grip on all the terrain I backpack in, and I really love the integrated gaiter of the shoe.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>I found the WRIGHTSOCK Escape and Merino Stride socks good for hiking and every-day use, but got blisters on my shins when using the Merino Coolmesh II otc socks for skiing. When hiking and in normal use I didn‚Äôt get any Blisters, and my feet were less sweaty, but I still had moist feet after a day of hiking. Overall I think they‚Äôre good socks for colder weather and activities where you usually get really sweaty feet.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49591965436/in/dateposted-public/" title="Hello, spring!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49591965436_e5ea5e4f2b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hello, spring!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>My WRIGHTSOCK package arrived in late November, and contained a pair of COOLMESH II Merino, ESCAPE crew and MERINO STRIDE crew, all in Size Large (which fits feet between 41,5 and 45). They have been used all for several weeks, mostly for day hikes and normal, every-day use.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49592209382/in/dateposted-public/" title="A package of WRIGHTSOCK socks!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49592209382_0542d0f3e8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="A package of WRIGHTSOCK socks!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The function of a sock is to absorb perspiration (= sweat!) as your feet are one of the biggest producers of sweat. Socks help to absorb the sweat from your feet and transport it to areas where air can evaporate the perspiration. And in cold weather, socks should insulate the foot and keep it toasty.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>All of the WRIGHTSOCK socks I tested were at least partly made from Dri-Wright, which is a Polyester fibre. Polyester dries quickly and keeps it shape/ form well, hence it is a good material for socks.</li>
  <li>All socks have an inner and outer layer, this construction is supposed to protect from blisters and help you keep dry feet</li>
  <li>Some of the socks I tested also had a Merino wool layer/ fabric, which made them less smelly and warmer</li>
  <li>And all socks also had a ‚Äústabilization zone‚Äù knitted into the metatarsal area</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The socks have held up well over the past three months and still look good. They can be washed at 40¬∞ which gets them nice and clean after a few days of use, and I expect them to hold at least another year or two of regular use.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The weight of the socks, as a pair (so both socks!), in Size Large, are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wrightsockshop.de/wrightsock/sockenhoehen/otc-kniehoch/19/merino-coolmesh-ii-otc">Merino Coolmesh II otc socks</a>: 88 g</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I‚Äôll look at two different use-cases here: Using the Merino Coolmesh II otc socks for skiing and using the Escape and Merino Stride socks for hiking and every-day use. Lets start with skiing and the Merino Coolmesh II otc socks. I sweat a LOT when I ski, and it doesn‚Äôt matter if it is skitouring and skinning up a mountain or just riding the whole day in the front country - I have soaking wet socks after a day on skis. I used the Merino Coolmesh II otc with my <a href="http://tidd.ly/5d07ff6d">La Sportiva Synchro</a> in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/02/father-son-ski-trip.html">Ruka</a> for two days, and already after the first day I had a strange feeling on my shins, but didn‚Äôt pay any attention to it. That was a mistake.</p>

<p>After the second day on the slopes I had on each leg a big blister on my shins. I never had blisters on my shins, ever before, so you can imagine I was really surprised to find blisters on my legs from using socks which claim they don‚Äôt give you blisters! Needless to say, I didn‚Äôt use the socks for skiing after that anymore, and would not use the socks for skiing ever again. This is even more surprising as I was literally only downhill skiing, in a light boot which was fastened as usual. On the plus side, my feet were slightly less sweaty, but they still were moist when I took the socks off.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the Escape and Merino Stride socks, which I used for hiking and in everyday use. Currently we have the shittiest winter ever and no snow, but temps still drop down to -11¬∞C or more in the mornings, and only slowly it rises throughout the day. In this weather these socks have been really good, and they kept my feet toasty and warm, even if I wore less warm shoes like the new <a href="http://tidd.ly/e9815221">Black Diamond Mission LT</a> shoes (I usually wear in the colder months the <a href="http://tidd.ly/ed40ce05">La Sportiva Crossover 2.0</a>). The Merino Stride socks are ideal for daily use as they can dry nicely inside, and they are toasty warm outside in the cold weather. The Escape is also great, though maybe a tiny bit less warm. Overall, as this are double-layer socks, they are warmer than other socks of a comparable weight, as in between the layers air is trapped, which helps keep your feet warm.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49592210972/in/dateposted-public/" title="WRIGHTSOCK Escape socks + Black Diamond Mission LT"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49592210972_99ca71d410_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="WRIGHTSOCK Escape socks + Black Diamond Mission LT" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Two things, though: I usually never get Blisters anymore as I use good shoes for hiking, backpacking, trailrunning and in every-day use, so I can not say that the claim of not getting Blisters when hiking with these socks works. Secondly, I still had moist feet when I took the socks off after a day outside, however, they were less sweaty than with normal socks. So while I still got sweaty feet they were less moist than with a normal pair of socks. I also liked the extra ‚Äúcushioning‚Äù these socks had because of the two layers, and they also felt nice and comfortable on my feet - the white inner sock has a minimal amount of seams, which is really positive in my book.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I don‚Äôt have suggestions for improvement, to be honest.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>Overall I liked the WRIGHTSOCK Escape and Merino Stride socks, and will use the Merino Coolmesh II otc socks for normal use when it‚Äôs cold, but not for skiing anymore. The Escape and Merino Stride socks are both well suited for backpacking and hiking, and the Escape sock definitely is the better pick for multi-day backpacking trips as it is made completely from synthetic materials and hence should dry faster than the Merino Stride socks. However, as most ultralight backpackers are well-used to hiking in wet footwear and hence moist socks, I think also the Merino Stride socks should be fine for backpacking. Especially if you have a problem with Blisters and really sweaty feet you might want to try these socks (<em>and please let me know if the ‚ÄúNo Blisters System‚Äù works for you!</em>)!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A month ago my son and me went on a father-son winter trip: XC skiing, Ice-fishing and of course downhill skiing was our program for a week, in which we had a lot of fun and got to know each other better.</p>

<p>Travelling with kids, it can be a hassle. We found the best way to do it for us is to do it in sections with longer breaks in the middle, plenty of comics to read and some candy &amp; snacks. With that strategy the 9-ish hour trip from Vaasa to Ruka went by without problems, and my 8-year old son and me arrived nice and punctual with the Skibus in the village of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/04/spring-skiing-in-ruka.html">Ruka</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49546855563/in/dateposted-public/" title="On the road"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49546855563_14c0513681_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="On the road" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>From the bus stop it was a one minute walk to our accommodation, the Ski-Inn right in the middle of Ruka Village. My skis were in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/04/packing-for-ski-touring.html">Douchebag</a> and our clothes in the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/arcteryx-v110-rolling-duffel-luggage/?pid=10239">Arc‚Äôteryx V110 Rolling Duffle</a> which made it easy for me to pull all our stuff while my son only had to carry his own backpack. Once we checked in to our room - a very nice apartment with our own kitchen, Sauna and two bed rooms - we went for a walk to the supermarket in the village to get some M√ºsli and dinner, and as we were sitting for 9 hours on our butts it also was good to go for a walk in the village, and explore more of Ruka, before going to our Sauna and hitting the hay - because we had some full, exciting days ahead for us =)</p>

<h2 id="skiing">Skiing</h2>

<p><strong>Or: Getting ready for off-piste adventures</strong></p>

<p>Day 1 in Ruka, and our first stop after breakfast is the <a href="https://ski.ruka.fi/en/pisterental">Piste Rental Shop</a> in the Village to pick up my son‚Äôs skis and our ski passes. Getting the gear is a fast affair and 10 Minutes later we‚Äôre outside again, sitting in the Gondola to Ruka Valley my son has a refresher session with <a href="https://new.ruka.fi/en/ski-school">Ruka Ski School</a>. We start on the brand-new Rosa &amp; Rudolf Slopes, where five belt lifts bring ski and snowboard beginners to the top of the fenced-in slope. After two runs the ski school teacher decides we will go to the real slopes right away as the young student is good enough.</p>

<p>After an hour on the slopes and having skied down some red and blue slopes it‚Äôs time to explore the ski resort on our own, with the tips and advice from our great ski school teacher in mind. The one thing I love about Ruka Ski Resort is how easy it is to explore the different sides and hills of the area, and I take my son towards Maasto, the <em>‚ÄúOff-the-beaten-track‚Äù</em> slopes in the east of the area. There‚Äôs substantially fewer people here skiing - and in the middle of January there‚Äôs already <em>REALLY</em> few people here! But we like it more silent, and the landscape with the snow-covered trees is here especially pretty, and there‚Äôs no-one waiting at the T-lift at the bottom of the slope either.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49546859283/in/dateposted-public/" title="hanging"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49546859283_367ef9e9ce_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="hanging" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And that‚Äôs how we spent several hours of the week each day. My son is a careful skier, and once we identified his favourite runs we would hit these first thing every day and then ski from left to right and back across the whole resort. We had some short breaks at the various huts or the Caf√©s along the slope, refilling energy levels with a hot chocolate and some Pulla, before it was back to the chair or T-Bar lifts and enjoy the finely prepared slopes anew.</p>

<p>Night skiing is a thing when the sun goes up at 10:30 am and sets at 2:00 pm, and thanks to very well illuminated slopes it‚Äôs not a problem at all to ski in darkness. This is especially useful when a parent still has energy to go skiing while a child would rather read comics at home üòâ</p>

<p>Overall I really had a great time skiing with my son at Ruka Ski Resort. I love the variety of runs and how easy it is to hit some off-piste terrain between the slopes. There are also enough easy routes and slopes which see less people, which makes it ideal if you‚Äôre there with kids.</p>

<h2 id="ice-fishing">Ice-fishing</h2>

<p><strong>Or: Learning to wait for the bait</strong></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547592972/in/dateposted-public/" title="Lake"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547592972_3ce980d304_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lake" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Besides daily skiing in the Ski resort we also had some other activities while we were in Ruka. One which my son and me enjoyed a lot was the visit to the <a href="https://www.palosaarenporotila.fi/en/">Reindeer and Fishing Farm Palosaari</a> closer to Kuusamo. We started our visit off with a ride on the reindeer sled, which was a lot of fun and my son got his <strong>Reindeer Driving License</strong> that day üòä</p>

<p>We continued down to the lake. This was an oasis of peace for me - I‚Äôm very sensitive to noise, and over here there was no disturbing noise as I hear it every day in the city. Out here on this calm lake there was only the wind which moved the snow-covered branches, and the occasional chirping of some Siberian Jays. Other than that there was only silence. Beautiful, natural silence.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547593567/in/dateposted-public/" title="Ice fishing"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547593567_93955f3311_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ice fishing" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Owner Mika showed us how to drill holes into the ice, clean the hole from slushy ice water, and then how to move our rods to entice the trout and bass in the lake to <em>go on the hook</em>. We discussed strategies - does it make sense to move every five minutes if you don‚Äôt have a contact or should you remain stationary for hours to wait till the fish come and visit you? The answer is, it depends. On the lake, you, the weather and temperature and the fish in the lake.</p>

<p>We adopted a strategy of moving every 20 to 30 minutes, but even after a few times of drilling new holes and trying our best to present the bait in the most tasty fashion, no fish was around to fall for our tasty maggots and shiny baits. Ah well, a good thing that Mika had a back-up plan üòâ After a few hours out on the lake we walked up to the lean-to shelter, where a fire was already burning and hot juice &amp; coffee as well as tasty, home-made treats were served. We sat around the fire, discussed developments in the region and how they affect reindeer farmers and tourism in the area, and again I was left wondering while our politicans make decisions which no one I spoke to wants, and which only benefit large multi-national companies, to the detriment of the local environment and people. I finished up my second cup of tasty coffee and then we walked back to the lake, with new motivation and hope to catch one of these elusive inhabitants of the lake.</p>

<p>Alas, also after another hour on the lake, moving and drilling several new holes into the ice, we had to admit that the fish were too smart for us (or simply not hungry üòÉ), as we didn‚Äôt catch a single one of them. However, my son, Anna-Riitta, Mika and me, we had a great time here on the silent lake, and so we were not at all disappointed when we packed up our fishing gear and headed back to the farm. Mika handed us our <a href="https://www.palosaarenporotila.fi/en/">Reindeer and Fishing Farm Palosaari</a> Reindeer Driving license, which now allows us to manoeuvre sleds pulled by Rudolf and his siblings, and then we made us on the way back to Ruka and hit the slopes for some afternoon skiing!</p>

<p><strong>Or: Why am I still this good?</strong></p>

<p>The long-time reader knows <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/ice-climbing-in-korouoma.html">I love ice climbing</a> but also is likely aware that I haven‚Äôt climbed much ice in recent years. The winters have been bad, I have discovered skitouring as a beautiful way to explore the outdoors in winter, and I also don‚Äôt have a lot of friends that climb ice anymore.</p>

<p>That all would change during our visit to Ruka, and to top things off my 8-year old son would also get to climb his first ice route! <a href="https://www.outdoorpassion.fi/en/">Outdoor Passion Finland</a>, which is run by Jussi and his wife Lotta, took us under their wings and both thought my son and rekindled my love for ice climbing. Lotta and Jussi are perfect with kids, and after we were kitted out with crampons, gaiters, harness, helmets and ice tools we hiked like John Wayne to the ice fall, which is in the middle of the ski resort and a spectacular 35 m high. But before we were allowed to climb, Jussi gave us a introduction to climbing on ice, from foot and tool placement to how to get back down.</p>

<p>My son was very brave and climbed his route really well, and I am very proud of him that he climbed this ice fall! I too did some ice climbing, and surprised myself quite a bit as I seemed to be able to climb the different routes without any issues. I haven‚Äôt climbed ice (or rock, or plastic üòü) in the past two years, so it was a bit of a shock that even on the steep route I had no problem with placing tools and crampons, climbing onto smaller ledges, and that there were also no screaming barfies. I even raced up the simplest route and got to the anchor in under two minutes‚Ä¶</p>

<p>After all the climbing Lotta and Jussi took us to explore the Ground-Ferrata which they had built in the nearby forest. It‚Äôs basically a track which takes you through the snow-covered forest, through the snow-covered spruce trees üå≤ ‚ù§Ô∏è and back to the ice wall. It was simple, but very beautiful and a great experience to go through the snow tunnel under the tree and climb back out!</p>

<h2 id="xc-skiing">XC Skiing</h2>

<p><strong>Or: There and Back again</strong></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547369956/in/dateposted-public/" title="XC skiing"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547369956_11f93fc12d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="XC skiing" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On our last full day in Ruka we decided to go XC skiing. My son usually goes XC skiing at school, but due to climate change and the ongoing disastrous winter winter we have in Vaasa he hasn‚Äôt been even once skiing with school, and as it is also an activity I enjoy a lot I felt it would be a good thing to do. What I didn‚Äôt account for was the strong, cold wind which was blowing across Lapland that morning, and which would bring a lot more snow over the following days to the North of the country‚Ä¶</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547596542/in/dateposted-public/" title="XC skiing 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547596542_608363c97a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="XC skiing 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We started again at the <a href="https://ski.ruka.fi/en/pisterental">Piste Rental Shop</a> where we loaned our XC skiing gear, and then we took the Gondola to Ruka Valley from where we would ski around 3,5 km to a Caf√©. So far the plan. The reality was that the weather really wasn‚Äôt very favourable, as we were skiing into the wind and snow, which my son didn‚Äôt enjoy particularly much. However, with the promise of a hot chocolate and pancakes or waffles we made it in the end to the small, cozy Caf√©, where we enjoyed our break.</p>

<p>The way back, as these things usually go, was easier. With the wind in our back, and some tasty treats in our bellies, as well as some gentle, fun downhills, we were back at the Gondola Station in Ruka Valley in some 30 minutes! We were also really lucky as just as we arrived a Gondola came in, and so we were sitting down in one of the cabins to get back to Ruka Village.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://lightfestival.fi">Polar Night Light Festival</a> is an annual Festival which transforms the slopes of Ruka into a colourful wonderland, with amazing light installations all across the village and slopes. It‚Äôs always in January as then it is still really dark up North, and definitely worth a visit. As a photographer I absolutely loved to see this Festival, and I highly recommend you take a good Tripod, footwear with good grip and warm clothes along if you plan to photograph them, as it does get cold on the slopes at night. Also take care of the Pistenbullies and snowmobiles which might ride on the slopes at night and prepare everything for skiers and snowboarders! Of course you also can just enjoy the installations when you go skiing after the sun set at 2:00 pm üòÜ</p>

<h2 id="being-a-good-parent">Being a good parent</h2>

<p><strong>Or: Learning to put others first</strong></p>

<p>My son and me, we can be like water &amp; fire, OR then we can be best friends. When it is just the two of us, and he gets all my attention, things definitely are a lot easier and we get along really well. I also am more relaxed, and try to remember to put his wants &amp; needs before mine. For example, if he gets tired or has no motivation to hit the slopes after a while, I usually have a hard time to accept that, but the smart, emphatic side of my brain then tells me to just let him go back to the apartment and chill &amp; read comics, while I continue to ski. That way be both are happy, and skiing (or other activities) don‚Äôt get a bad connotation for him, which means in the long-run he‚Äôs more likely to enjoy these activities as much as me. After all, we were here to have a good time together, and when one is not enjoying something it‚Äôs not smart to force him to do it. With high costs for renting gear and lift passes it‚Äôs easy to forget these things, but in the long-term I feel it‚Äôs better for all involved, and it definitely worked well for us on this and past trips.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-eat--where-to-stay">What to Eat &amp; Where to Stay</h2>

<p>We stayed at the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/rukasuites">Ski Inn</a> in the centre of Ruka Village, and had a super-nice apartment. We enjoyed the Sauna every evening together, and the small kitchen was all I needed to cook some simple meals for us two. The Supermarket was a stone-throw away, as were a handful of restaurants and Caf√©s. There are plenty more <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/where-to-stay">places to stay in Ruka</a> for any budget, and especially the brand-new <a href="https://www.ski-inn.fi/en/majoitus/ruka/hotel-rukavalley">Ruka Valley</a> Hotel &amp; Apartments look like a great choice for families as the Kids Slope are in front of the building!</p>

<p>We ate in a variety of places during our stay, from the new <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/campkitchen">CAMP Kitchen</a> which serves a super-tasty Vegan Bowl and a good kids Burger, to <a href="https://ruokburger.fi">RUOK</a> and <a href="http://www.hankibaari.fi">Hankibaari</a> which have very good options for people with all kind of diets. We also cooked at least once a day in our apartment, basics like Pesto-Pasta and Pizza kept the food expenses low and were really good, too!</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-ruka">Getting to Ruka</h2>

<p>As I have <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/04/spring-skiing-in-ruka.html">said in the past</a>: The most convenient way is to take the <a href="http://vr.fi">train</a> and <a href="https://matkahuolto.fi">bus</a> to Ruka, or if you come from abroad you can fly to the <a href="https://www.finavia.fi/en/airports/kuusamo">Kuusamo Airport</a> and take the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/getting-around">Ski Bus</a> to the village and Ruka Valley. In the winter <a href="https://www.onnibus.com/">OnniBus</a> has direct connections from the south to Ruka which are really affordable and a really good option as one doesn‚Äôt need to change. On the train you can sleep, work and walk around, and during the bus trip you can enjoy the beautiful Finnish landscape while listening to your favourite tunes. We downloaded the Finnish version of the Donald Duck Comic magazine which allowed us to download hundreds of comics to the iPad, which made for a relaxing trip as my son was reading hours at a time on the bus &amp; train. Also some salty and sweet treats were handed out every now and then, and longer breaks were scheduled in so we didn‚Äôt need to stress in case a train or bus were running late.</p>
