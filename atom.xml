<p>Flat tires on 29” wheels, they where common for me back with my old 29er. Happily I started to drive more careful and punctures have been rare in the last several years, but as I welcomed the Trek 920 Disc to the family I decided I wanted to ride it Tubeless. There where some good reasons for that:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>You can save weight.</strong> I’m still a ultralight backpacker at heart and if there’s a possibility to save weight then I’ll take it.</li>
  <li><strong>Adiós, Punctures!</strong> Don’t like that sound of your inner tube going flat? I hate it, and with a healthy dose of your Latex liquid in your tube that sound is unlikely to reach your ears again.</li>
  <li><strong>Traction, baby!</strong> Less pressure on the tires means you have more traction - pretty useful in sharp curves and lose trails.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, with three good reasons to get rid of inner tubes I set out on a sunny afternoon to convert my 920 Disc to Tubeless. It isn’t a quick operation by all means so make sure you have a couple of hours of peace to go about this. Here’s what you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tubeless-Ready Rims</li>
  <li>Tubeless-Ready Tires, I chose the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/schwalbe-thunder-burt-tl-easy-29er-psc-snakeskin-faltbar/?pid=10239">Schwalbe Thunder Burt Evo SnakeSkin PaceStar 29x2,10” TL-Easy Folding</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/schwalbe-tubeless-easy-kit-23-fahrradreifen/?pid=10239">Schwalbe Tubeless Easy Kit</a></li>
  <li>Schwalbe Tire Booster or a compressor</li>
  <li>Floor pump</li>
  <li>A bucket with soapy water and some rags</li>
</ul>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35630505293/in/dateposted/" title="Frontwheel finished!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4357/35630505293_650cc34354_b.jpg" width="1024" height="936" alt="Frontwheel finished!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Alright, with all your tools and gear ready it’s time to start.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Preparation is KEY! Your Tire Booster needs to be “primed” first, so take your floor pump and put some 11 bars of air in it - that way you don’t need to do it later. Also, a good thing to do is to unfold your tire - if you’re using a tire that comes folded like I did - before you start the whole operation - and hang it into the sun. It will warm up and get a tiny, tiny bit more flexible which makes it easier to put on the rim later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lets first check if your rim is Tubeless-Ready. If it is it should be written on it somewhere - either it reads <em>Tubeless Ready</em> or <em>“TLR”</em> somewhere. If they are: Great, that saved you several hundred Euros for new Rims!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36269911182/in/dateposted/" title="Is the Rim Tubeless Ready?"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4437/36269911182_390912e928_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Is the Rim Tubeless Ready?" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<ol>
  <li>Time to deflate the tube, remove tire + tube + old rim tape, and get cleaning. Take a soapy rag and clean the inside (and while you’re at it, also the outside) of the rim, remove all dirt &amp; dust and then dry it well off. That’s because the next step is quite crucial for the success of the whole operation, and if you hurry through this you might do it twice, so calm and relaxed proceed you shall. Now you grab the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/schwalbe-tubeless-felgenband-fahrradreifen/?pid=10239">Tubeless Rim Tape</a> (these are available in different widths, make sure to buy the one which works best for your rim!) and apply careful and precisely the tape to the inside of the rim. Start opposite of the hole where the valve will go through later, and apply it carefully and cleanly with a lot of pressure to the rim, and avoid air bubbles. I say it again: <em>This is a very important step, so don’t hurry and take your time.</em> If you’ve gone once around and reach the start go another 5 to 10 cm and then cut the tape. Now take the Tubeless Valve from the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/schwalbe-tubeless-easy-kit-23-fahrradreifen/?pid=10239">Tubeless Easy Kit</a> and put it through the rim tape where it belong. Make sure to screw it tightly onto the rim, as the area around the valve can be a point where air easily escapes.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Time to take your <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/schwalbe-thunder-burt-tl-easy-29er-psc-snakeskin-faltbar/?pid=10239">Tubeless Tire</a> and mount it carefully onto the rim. If you can don’t use the tire lever as it might damage the rim tape - if you had your unfolded tire hang in the sun this should be possible. Make sure that the tire’s beads are on each side of the valve before you head on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time to inflate! Apply a generous coating of the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/schwalbe-montagefluid-easy-fit-bike-tires/?pid=10239">Easy Fit</a> assembly liquid to both sides of the tire beads, the (clean!) soapy water would work too. For the first inflation a powerful burst of air is needed so take the Tire Booster (or if you have one, the compressor) and attach it to the valve. It makes sense to take the top of the valve off to allow more air through-flow, you get a wee tool for that in the Tubeless Easy Kit. Alrighty, this is the moment of truth: Open the Tire Booster and see how your Tubeless Tire inflates. It should set with several loud <strong>BANG!</strong> sounds onto the rim, only if you hear that you know everything went as planned. You need to check the line on the tire to control if the complete tire is correctly mounted, if not knead and push the tire to get it into the right position.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36042172070/in/dateposted/" title="Easy Fit!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4401/36042172070_5cb9d07278_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Easy Fit!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36269910952/in/dateposted/" title="Tire Booster in action"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4381/36269910952_d1dbe91ae1_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="Tire Booster in action" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This can be a stressful moment if you don’t hear that loud bang which indicates that the tire beads have engaged the rim - I tried for over an hour to get it to set down. The thing is that 29” tires (and Fatbike Tires even more so) take a lot of air to fill and that in my case the Tire Booster didn’t have enough power to engage the complete tire - it didn’t set down on a couple of places which means that the air was escaping and I couldn’t move on. The solution is to empty the whole Tire Booster into the Tire to get the Tire to set down on as many places on the rim as possible, and then switch to the Floor Pump and keep on inflating the tire. This did the trick for me - the tire looked almost like it was going to burst but in the end I heard the several loud bangs which meant the tire was now fully engaged to the rim. Success, at last!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Now that the tire sits on the rim you can take the pump/ compressor/ Tire Booster off the valve. This will deflate the tire a wee bit, but that’s not a problem. Remove the valve insert if you haven’t done that already in the previous step and take a bottle of the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/schwalbe-doc-blue-professional-inner-tube/?pid=10239">Doc Blue puncture protection liquid</a> - now it’s time to put it into your Tire and make it Tubeless! You can easily fill the bottle through the valve into the tire - for 29” tires you use the whole 60 ml, smaller tires need less. Once the bottle is empty you put the valve insert back, take the floor pump and inflate the tire again - around 2 bar for these 29” tires is good for starters. Remove the pump, close the valve and now you’ll need to roll and shake the tire for quite a bit - the goal is to distribute the puncture protection liquid everywhere in the tire so that an even cover covers it from the inside. To check the tire once more for leaks you can cover the outside of the tire along the rim with your soapy water - there where there’s bubbles building up you need to move the puncture protection liquid on the inside to cover it better.</li>
</ol>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35630506573/in/dateposted/" title="Doc Blue goes in!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4372/35630506573_cb13980646_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Doc Blue goes in!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>If the tire now stays inflated you can attach it back to the bike and get started on the second wheel, after which you should head out for a test ride. All good? Then pack up your bike and head out on a bikepacking Microadventure - Tubeless Edition!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36269915742/in/dateposted/" title="Schwalbe Thunder Burt Tubeless"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4370/36269915742_7e1a2ca31b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Schwalbe Thunder Burt Tubeless" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I’m now riding since over a month Tubeless and love it. I can ride my tires with less pressure on the trails which equals better traction, but of course the biggest benefit for me is that I don’t need to worry about punctures and snake bites anymore, as the puncture protection liquid seals those immediately should they happen. It’s just a great feeling to know that you can ride how you want without needing to worry that you might end up with a flat tire! Finally, if you’re a friend of moving pictures then have a look at <a href="https://youtu.be/M2fVuTqicCc">this video</a> which is by and far the best on how to convert your tires to tubeless tires!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Piezo Ignition of your Primus Lite+ Stove is broken? Do not despair - you can repair it at home with a minimum amount of tools! In this article I show you that you don’t need to be a Wizard to get it fixed!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36117927172/in/dateposted/" title="New Piezo Ignition in place"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4307/36117927172_025c2059ba_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="New Piezo Ignition in place" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I like my <a href="http://bit.ly/2vaSwlw">Primus Lite+</a>. It ain’t the lightest stove I own, but it is very convenient to use. Too bad just that the Piezo Ignition of it broke on a recent camping trip :/ Primus was friendly enough to supply me a <a href="http://www.primus.eu/catalogsearch/result/?q=Piezo+igniter+lite%2B">new Piezo Ignition</a> and as I had a wee bit of free time I made a short video of me repairing it. Make sure to click on quality and choose 4K to see it in all its glory:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XeAM1Mfm_YQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>As you see, it’s pretty easy and straight-forward. I don’t own a small screw driver, but I had a small bit which fitted just fine. My pliers are from my modelling hobby, I reckon if you don’t have pliers even a strong pair of scissors would do the job. Then just put everything back together, bend the cable from the Piezo Igniter slightly back down to the stove head and <strong>Boom!</strong> - your Piezo Ignition is fixed and ready to ignite your stove again. All in all it took maybe five minutes, so an easy task.</p>

<p>One can’t eat enough healthy food. Sure, we all might fantasize after several days on the trail about Pizza or Hamburgers, but when you arrive at your camping spot or the belay ledge half-way through the wall what your body really need is a tasty &amp; healthy portion of food. And the Barley-Lentils-Risotto with Avocado Mousse from LYO Food is exactly that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EB2p6nyQx5M">Watch the video</a> to see how this vegan meal tastes:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EB2p6nyQx5M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><strong>In short:</strong> This is the most tasty vegan backpacking meal I have tried yet. Excellently spiced with a nice crunch from the barley and lentils this is a meal I could always eat anywhere and if you’d served it to me on a plate in a Restaurant I wouldn’t doubt that a Chef would have made it in the kitchen for me. The only downside I can think of is that it packs only 433 kcal for the 110 g pouch which might be to little after a hard day outdoors, but other than that I find this an excellent meal. If you’re now curious about the Barley-Lentils-Risotto with Avocado Mousse you can buy it directly from <a href="https://lyofood.com/collections/main-meals/products/barley-lentils-risotto-with-avocado-mousse">LYO Food</a> or at the <a href="https://www.outdoorfoodshop.de/de/vegane-outdoornahrung/193-graupen-linsen-risotto-avocado-lyofood-5902768107647.html">Outdoor Food Shop</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://hikinginfinland.com/hikinginfinland/2017/07/dps-dreamtime.html"/>
    <updated>2017-07-19T15:07:23+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/hikinginfinland/2017/07/dps-dreamtime</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Winter is coming</em>.</p>

<p>Yes, the new GoT Season just started, and I couldn’t help myself and add that reference. But seriously, winter is coming soon enough and what better time is now than to dream about skiing chin-deep powder and purchase a limited edition of the World’s best skis, the DPS Alchemist?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35890163671/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Alchemist x contour skins in Lyngen 2017"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4296/35890163671_4f0cc4ae05_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DPS Alchemist x contour skins in Lyngen 2017" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/gear-of-the-year-dps-wailer-tour1-skis.html">I love my DPS Skis</a>. Yes, they are not cheap. But good things seldom are (exceptions include spending time outdoors in the mountains on skis &amp; sleeping in a tent) so when it’s the middle of summer and we snow-loving people are just begging for the white, fluffy stuff to return it’s also a good moment to shop for new skis. And that’s what <a href="https://www.dpsskis.com/en/dreamtime-2017">DPS Dreamtime</a> is all about:</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35981791526/in/dateposted/" title="Mark Your Calendar"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4318/35981791526_7c0a7fb09c_b.jpg" width="800" height="800" alt="Mark Your Calendar" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Dreamtime is the only time ever that DPS Skis are discounted, and to top things of awesome limited-run artwork Special Edition skis are also available. Here’s a few impressions from their factory in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, on what you can get:</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35183918474/in/dateposted/" title="PW Cassiar 87"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4296/35183918474_4ff96bba31_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="PW Cassiar 87" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The carbon pressing machines at DPS are so photogenic, don’t you think? That’s an equally photogenic pair of <a href="https://www.dpsskis.com/en/powderworks-cassiar-87">Powderworks Cassiar 87</a> skis standing in front of the press.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35889866351/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Factory 02"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4303/35889866351_bf88dd0c15_b.jpg" width="800" height="800" alt="DPS Factory 02" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Them Austrian world cup race bases are prepped and ready to be mated with the ski. They’re fast, in case you didn’t see the <em>Race</em> in their name.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35889865881/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Dreamtime Skis"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4309/35889865881_f7157618e5_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="DPS Dreamtime Skis" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And that are the Special Edition Artworks for the Wailer, Yvette, Zelda and Nina Skis. Damn, they are awesome! If I wouldn’t own a pair of Alchemist Wailer Skis already I’d be very tempted to get another pair! Thus if you, like me, can’t wait for winter to arrive, then a pair of <a href="https://www.dpsskis.com/en/dreamtime-2017">DPS Dreamtime</a> Skis might just be what makes the waiting time go by easier. And then, when the first big snow flakes start to cover the mountains, then you are ready to go hit the slopes on your new DPS Skis.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34422359486/in/album-72157681319341321/" title="Powder Turns"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4181/34422359486_b3c2ceae39_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Powder Turns" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35147389234/in/dateposted/" title="Firepot Dal and Rice with Spinach"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4322/35147389234_5c9d38b6b8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Firepot Dal and Rice with Spinach" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I like vegetarian food. Sure, I don’t say know to a good piece of cheese or some fresh reindeer meat, but if I can choose I always go vegetarian. Truth be told, I’m pondering since years to make the jump and go plant-based in my nutrition. So when I was talking with Firepot about testing their meals (and I tested them all!) it was an easy choice for me to pick their vegan backpacking meal for my video review. There are simply not many (good) vegan options available if you do not want to make the meals yourself, and as an increasing number of backpackers, climbers, cyclists and runners go without meat &amp; dairy I felt it’s a good idea to test Firepot’s vegan meal. Watch the video to see how I like Dal and Rice with Spinach:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TFIJ8rN3Mrs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><strong>In short</strong>: I think it’s a great Vegan meal for outdoor persons. The right mix of spices which let the other ingredients come through, and if you love lentils like I do you won’t be disappointed. Salt is a personal taste and while I find it could do with a bit more of it, I reckon Northern Europeans who generally use less salt in their food will find it just fine. All in all a nice addition to the vegan meal options for plant-powered outdoor persons of all kind. If you’d like to try Dal and Rice with Spinach you can order it directly from <a href="https://www.outdoorfood.com/collections/firepot-dehydrated-meals/products/dal-and-rice-with-spinach?variant=35639591306">Firepot</a> in the UK or from the <a href="https://www.outdoorfoodshop.de/en/vegan/710-daln-rice-w-spinach-by-firepot-5060517780043.html?search_query=firepot&amp;results=5">OutdoorFoodShop</a> in Germany.</p>

    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/hikinginfinland/2017/07/wildside-the-enchanted-life-of-hunters-and-gatherers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Wildside: The Enchanted Life of Hunters and Gatherers</em> is another book by <a href="http://shop.gestalten.com/books/wildside.html">Gestalten</a> that caters to the lifestyle outdoor Instagram person. At least that was my first impression when I saw the book - but covers can lie, and once I started to read I actually quite liked it.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35703340791/in/photostream/" title="Wildside: The Enchanted Life of Hunters and Gatherers"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4235/35703340791_3a545d6ede_b.jpg" width="970" height="1024" alt="Wildside: The Enchanted Life of Hunters and Gatherers" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The Gestalten Publishing house has published a host of books - <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/07/the-great-wide-open.html">The Great Wide Open</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/04/off-the-road.html">Off the Road</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/hide-and-seek.html">Hide and Seek - The Architecture of Cabins and Hide-Outs</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/04/the-outsiders.html">The Outsiders</a>  - which all look a bit like they garner to the Instagram crowd - and probably that’s what they want and do. And while some of these are not really a success for me, others are good. <a href="http://amzn.to/2tLQ9EM">Wildside</a> is in the latter camp, even if the Cover can be deceiving and you might just think this book is like Instagram photos you’ve seen a thousand times just printed on nice paper, but it has more to offer on its 250 something pages.</p>

<p>There’s essays of #Vanlife Dwellers in the book, inspiring and artsy photos, little businesses are showcased, you learn more about hunting in Germany and Sweden, you go foraging in Finland and then you are taken surfing and to Switzerland. It’s a visual journey interspersed with short stories and essays, and even if some of these topics might not interest you much you might find a little piece of joy or wisdom from another one, so take the time to read each - because if not you might miss out.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35703340211/in/photostream/" title="Wildside: The Enchanted Life of Hunters and Gatherers Book"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4255/35703340211_24b639e221_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Wildside: The Enchanted Life of Hunters and Gatherers Book" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So whom is this book aimed at? If you feel like you’d like to see what else is possible than running the rat race from 9-to-5 every day, then this book certainly can plant some ideas into your mind. Or if you’re looking for inspiration where to travel next. Or even how to travel - by #Vanlife, on foot or in a canoe, there’s better options than flying for a week to an all-inclusive resort (<em>but that you, as a reader of an outdoor blog, knew either way already</em> ;).</p>

<p>Also for those who look for culinary ideas this book obviously will be of interest, be it from gathering mushrooms or catching fish - modern Hunters &amp; Gatherers will enjoy this book without a doubt. Overall it is a beautiful book that inspires to try something new, presented in a visually pleasing way, though I do find the chosen typefaces for much of the text unsuccessful as it isn’t pleasing to read. Other than that - if you’re interested in one thing I told about of this book - check out a copy at your local library or order a copy home to sit down with it, out in the summer sun. You can buy Wildside directly at Gestalten or via one of these Affiliate Links at <a href="http://amzn.to/2tLQ9EM">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/2utIyrZ">Amazon.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/2tPxSpX">Amazone.de</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just 20 Minutes to the summit? Yeah, right.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34911209154/in/dateposted/" title="#MountainLies"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4099/34911209154_f01315429d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="#MountainLies" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>When you’re out hiking and backpacking with friends there come these times on the hill where you or someone else is starting to not have fun anymore. It’s too hot, the summit seems far away, you’re sweating or are soaking wet from the rain. That’s the moment someone usually utters one or several #MountainLies - a lie to keep you motivated. If you’re an active Hiker and outdoors person you probably have heard some of these said. Here’s the five most common lies uttered on the mountain.</p>

<h2 id="behind-that-hill-is-the-summit">Behind that hill is the summit</h2>

<p>This is the mountain lie I have told several times myself. But then things conspired against me and, well, the summit wasn’t behind that hill - and also not after the next one, and next one, and next one. When Motivation is low and the summit the goal, this is the lie you will most likely hear. It keeps people going, but <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-the-bregenzerwald.html">the summit</a> - it never is behind that hill, but more likely another good hour of steep hiking further away.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29024562754/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Almost at the summit"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8256/29024562754_862a199ca5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Almost at the summit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="this-is-the-steepest-part">This is the steepest part</h2>

<p>The trail is steep. Steep as in, you’re using hand and feet to actually be able to move upward. For your friends with the DNA of an ibex this is no problem at all, but those who lack these genes are sweaty, angry and want to turn around. Because <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/autumn-backpacking-in-the-dolomites.html">climbing up this near vertical trail</a> just is no fun. <em>This is the steepest part, it gets easier after this section</em> is what you’ll likely hear then. But it doesn’t get flatter - at least not for long. With some luck you’re going to encounter a bit further up the “trail” a section which is even steeper. Lucky for you that it’s not raining, right?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20660450391/in/album-72157656091400816/" title="Lago di Sorapiss and a wonderful scree field"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5692/20660450391_04f879eb54_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Lago di Sorapiss and a wonderful scree field" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="its-not-going-to-rain-today">It’s not going to rain today</h2>

<p>This Mountain Lie you usually hear in the morning while you’re sitting at the breakfast table or at the trailhead. The clouds look more black and menacing than anything you’ve seen before in your life - and wasn’t that thunder you heard there in the distance? <em>No, it’s not gonna rain today</em> - usually followed by the sentence <em>That’s what the weather forecast promised</em>. If you’re still sitting at home and have a good book along - heat up the stove, grab a second cup of coffee and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/09/andrew-skurka-the-ultimate-hikers-gear-guide.html">read that book</a> while your weather-forecast-trusting friends will be soaked to the bone.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29831355665/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Cloudy?"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8148/29831355665_d56e989435_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cloudy?" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="the-sun-comes-out-in-a-moment">The sun comes out in a moment</h2>

<p>When you did believe your weather-forecast-trusting friends and went hiking with them in the rain, after you’re soaking wet and you are angry that you believed the membrane’s claim to “<a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/marmot-speed-light-jacket.html">Guaranteed to keep you dry</a>” your friend with the undying trust in the weather forecast will proclaim that <em>the sun comes out in a moment</em>. This usually means you will continue to be hiking in the rain and clouds until you’re back at home, when indeed the sun might come out before it dips behind the mountains. After all, a moment is a very brief amount of time which can stretch to many hours.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27688672272/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Sunrise on the Kanisfluh!"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7568/27688672272_588f6a62e3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunrise on the Kanisfluh!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="only-20-minutes-till-the-mountain-hut">Only 20 minutes till the Mountain Hut</h2>

<p>You’re hungry and have no power left. All you want is a hot cup of coffee and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/11/packrafting-and-mountainbiking-in-the-kaiserwinkl.html">a delicious plate of Kaiserschmarrn</a>. You’ll voice this situation to your friends, and prompt comes the reply from the mate up ahead on the trail: <em>“Only 20 minutes till the Mountain Hut”</em>. You continue hiking, savouring already that delicious food in front of you, and in just twenty short minutes you’re able to sit down and enjoy it. After fifteen minutes of hiking you get light doubts - there’s no hut to be seen anywhere. Another five minutes later it dawns on you that it was not in a life-time 20 minutes to the next hut, but more likely another hour.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16722309005/in/album-72157645045051650/" title="Schronisko Ornak"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8621/16722309005_bbefa8249f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Schronisko Ornak" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35675084516/in/dateposted/" title="Osprey Levity Lid"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4290/35675084516_0a69739c0b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Osprey Levity Lid" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>First up is the <strong>Osprey Levity</strong> backpack. It’s an OutDoor Award Winner, will come in spring 2018 into the shops and then is available in two sizes: 45 l (810 g) and 60l (850 g). What is special about the Levity is that while it looks like a normal Ultralight backpack it actually has a ventilated mesh back. My hand easily fit between the backpanel of the pack and the mesh frame, this should make it an excellent choice for hiking in very warm climates. The large side pockets can be accessed from the top and side, there’s a very big front pocket for gear you need throughout the day and a zippered lid which stores keys, phone, wallet and such.</p>

<p>The beauty of this pack is not just that it means lightweight packs go <em>really</em> mainstream but that this will open up lightweight backpacking up to a much wider audience. Osprey packs can be found in many brick &amp; mortar outdoor shops around the globe, and that means consumers will see this pack live in the store, can try it out, and convince themselves of the benefit of a lightweight pack that carries well. It’s, so to speak, the perfect backpack to convert many more people to the ultralight path of backpacking because it’s nice that you can e &amp; try the pack before you buy it.</p>

<p>Another backpack which was light and innovative is  the <strong>ORTOVOX Peak Light 32 Backpack</strong>. I’m a big fan of ORTOVOX and really like their garments, but also their paired down alpine packs are really interesting. This is a pack for the alpine climbing community and comes with a Swiss Wool backpanel. The pack is 1.050 g light but can be stripped to 690 g if you take off the lid, hip belt and wire frame for the back. But the Swisswool-tec-Knit Back System is the really interesting part here, as in it Ortovox combines <em>foam and pressed Swiss wool covered with a high-tech knitted fabric with a different hole structure.</em> This processing should enable excellent temperature management and should still be comfortable if you’ve sweated on the wool back panel. As it is wool it has the same properties as your wool shirts. Does it work? Well, for that you should check out reviews once these packs are out for a while =)</p>

<p>To get into the Mammut booth you had to be a Blogger (Yay!) or have an appointment. I lacked the latter thus made use of my Blogger Pass to enter the booth, and here the <strong>Mammut Trion Nordwand 20</strong> pack caught my attention. That ain’t difficult as it is orange and I am drawn to everything orange (I blame my Dutch Heritage). The 20 l pack weighs 580 g, is made of a Dyneema Ripstop material, has a clean look and even is pretty water-resistant with a 5,000 mm water column. Like the garments in the Eiger Extreme Series the pack has been been developed using Mammut High Reach Technology in the carrying system, which Mammut claims makes reaching upwards easier &amp; hence provides additional freedom of movement for climbing. If your goals are fast &amp; light ascents of high mountains then this is a pack to keep in mind for summer 2018.</p>

<p>The next pack brings us back to the trails and is made for backpacking. Long-time readers might recall that my first backpack was a Gregory pack, for which I paid 500 DM back when we had not yet the Euro (It’d would be 250€ in today’s money!). For a teenager that was a lot of money, and I used this pack for over ten years until I lost it in an accident (possibly I repeat this story every year anew?). Anyway, fast forward to 2018 and we’ll get the <strong>Gregory Optic</strong>, (and Octal for Women, which is a much cooler name!), Gregory’s next foray into the lightweight pack niche.</p>

<p>It isn’t as light as the Levity above at 1.120 g for the 48 l version and 1.140 g for the 58 l pack, but it comes with the Gregory-specific comfortable fit, robust materials and full functionality. It has an AeroSpan suspension system which is a further development of the Gregory VaporSpan system, and also should make the pack comfortable to wear in warmer climates. Add in the well-carrying hipbelt from gregory and you have a pack that should carry loads up to 14 kg nicely. It also has a large stretch front pocket, stretch side pockets, an integrated raincover and several bells &amp; whistles to attach things to the pack. At 190€/ 210€ it’s a bit cheaper than the Levity but almost 300 g heavier. However, this is again a step into the right direction I believe, as it makes lightweight backpacks easily available to a large audience, and hence I welcome this addition to the market.</p>

<p>CiloGear was also again at the show and handing out backpacks to this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CiloGear/photos/a.410469092734.196568.42853277734/10154411493187735/?type=3&amp;theater">Thomas Huber</a> guy. I also got a backpack - and then the owner whispered something into my ear, I gave back the pack (the second CiloGear backpack I returned voluntarily - yeps, I might be slightly insane =) and now am waiting for a parcel of joy from Oregon.</p>

<p>I also saw the two new Arc’teryx trailrunning backpacks - and while I have some photos of them they’re not that good, hence the stock photo underneath. The <strong>Arcteryx Norvan Hydration Vest</strong> comes in a 7 l and a 14 l Version and the 14 l version is lighter than the smaller 7 l pack. The Norvan 14 is 256 g or 417 g with the included bladder, while the Norvan 7 weighs 263 g or 424 g with the water bladder. Both packs have that <em>comfortable ‘bounce-free’ fit that wears more like clothing, yet with the functionality of a backpack</em>. The 14 l pack is carrying your snacks, water and kit for long runs, while the smaller Norvan 7 is for shorter runs where you don’t need so much gear. Both are impeccably designed as you know from <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/arcteryx-workshop-tour.html">Arc’teryx</a> and will retail for 170€ and 190€ respectively.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the last backpack in this article, the <strong>Eagle Creek Global Companion Travel Pack</strong>. This is a pack for my travel (blogger) friends who only take a carry-on on their journeys. Available as a 40l and a 65l pack these fold open like a book  and have zippered compartments which keep your garments and kit in place which is great for packing and unpacking - I’m not a big fan of packing a pack from the top. At 1.620 g for the 40 l pack and 2.330 g for the 65 l pack they’re not super light, but if you only need it to get your gear from the Airport to your <a href="www.airbnb.com/c/hmorkel">AirBnB</a> or Ho(s)tel it’s alright. They have side pockets, self-repairing and lockable zippers, a rainfly and have the No Matter What™ Warranty - though as they’re build from durable materials you probably don’t need to make use of it.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35157179300/in/dateposted/" title="Chilling in the Helsport Lofoten"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4231/35157179300_88baec6593_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Chilling in the Helsport Lofoten" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After a week at Lake Constance and an almost 38 h long trip home (Thanks Frankfurt Airport!) it’s time to pen down some thoughts from the 2017 OutDoor Show in Friedrichhafen. This was, as I just realized, my fifth OutDoor Show - I haven’t missed it since I <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2013/">first went in 2013</a>. As I blog professionally since several years the show is a mandatory visit to meet partners new &amp; old (I’m a Helsport Ambassador, sponsored by La Sportiva and talking with a handful of companies for specific projects). While at the beginning of my OutDoor visits the new gear was of course quite exciting (and still is) it is more and more about the people I meet at the fair which makes the fair so valuable &amp; exciting for me.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34734985353/in/dateposted/" title="Glen Van Peski and Chris Townsend on the #OutDoorFN"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4256/34734985353_4d91b1387c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Glen Van Peski and Chris Townsend on the #OutDoorFN" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Take for example Glen Van Peski, the founder of Gossamer Gear, and Chris Townsend, the renown Backpacking Writer. I met Glen and his wife by pure co-incidence (funnily enough at the Osprey booth while we were all checking out the Levity backpack) and we later in the afternoon managed to meet-up again for a beer and chat more. I also ran a couple of times into Chris and we had a nice evening chatting with fellow bloggers. Add in that I also met again my long-time friend Jotaro from Locus Gear, many, many blogger, photographer and journalism colleagues and you will quickly realize that the show is for me about the people I meet here. The same goes for my contacts as the various companies I visit - many are much more than just “work contacts” but friends with whom we talk about family &amp; life (which means sometimes only around 10 minutes remain to check out the new gear!).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34734958003/in/dateposted/" title="Alastair Humphreys on the OutDoor Stage"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4213/34734958003_7e3324c12d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Alastair Humphreys on the OutDoor Stage" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Speaking of gear, it felt industry-wise lightweight is getting more &amp; more to the front - a good things for us ultralight everything enthusiasts. Lighter garments, lighter shoes, lighter backpacks, lighter tents &amp; shelters, lighter stoves &amp; food, lighter climbing gear, lighter packrafting equipment, lighter bikepacking kit - across the board you’re able to find much more lighter gear for your outdoor activities. Functionality didn’t suffer, though - this lighter kit should be able to perform just as well as heavier counterparts.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35376626162/in/dateposted/" title="Best Booth of the Fair: The Houdini Garden"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4229/35376626162_33cd381407_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Best Booth of the Fair: The Houdini Garden" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My favourite booth this year was the Houdini Garden above - it was just wonderful and happily the temperatures this year (up to 32°C!) meant it was nice to sit outside in the shade. Add in that the smoothies &amp; cocktails they served from the herbs which they have grown in the composted Houdini garments soil were super tasty.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35157176010/in/dateposted/" title="Awesome new Vaude Performance Mats"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4259/35157176010_53842e349e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Awesome new Vaude Performance Mats" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I’ll try to delve into depth in more articles about the gear I saw at the show, but in this post I want to highlight some kit which I remember from the top of my head. First is probably the new series of Vaude sleeping mats. These are so well engineered that I believe they will be super-successful when they hit the market as so many details on them are just <strong>Wow!</strong></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34734943163/in/dateposted/" title="New Arc&#x27;teryx Konseal FL Approach Shoe"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4264/34734943163_74b2d06ff4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="New Arc&#x27;teryx Konseal FL Approach Shoe" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>These new Arc’teryx Konseal FL Approach shoes are beautifully designed and so light, I hope to get a pair for my feet before 2018!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35376671012/in/dateposted/" title="New Paramo Manu Shirt"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4262/35376671012_3256998877_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="New Paramo Manu Shirt" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Paramo’s new design is superb - gone the more conservative and boxy cuts &amp; colours, welcome to youthful &amp; fresh designs which promise to also perform well outdoors.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34735997253/in/dateposted/" title="Rab Mythic 400"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4290/34735997253_9fb8ced02e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Rab Mythic 400" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Rab launched a 7D sleeping bag line, and the Mythic 400 sleeping bag here will tip the scales at 660 g and has a comfort rating of -1°C. Feels great on the skin and could shed quite some weight in the sleeping bag department.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35157981650/in/dateposted/" title="Kupilka 37"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4266/35157981650_6e8908f43e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Kupilka 37" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The new Kupilka 37 Kuksa has 370 ml of volume and is thus quite a bit bigger than the regular good old Kupilka 21 - an increase in size which is very welcome as this could make it the one cup for all your trips! I got one and will put it through its paces the next months to see if it is a worthy addition to the gear closet.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34734977903/in/dateposted/" title="Osprey Levity 45"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4290/34734977903_528036f73d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Osprey Levity 45" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Osprey Levity backpack looks like a well designed lightweight backpack with a ventilated back.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34734969483/in/dateposted/" title="Houdini Garments can be composted!"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4233/34734969483_0371c4a6c0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Houdini Garments can be composted!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Another trend is that sustainability, recycling and closing the loop is no longer just on the mind of a few outliers - across the board you could see an uptake of this topic on the show. From shoes which are Made in Europe to garments which can be recycled, composted and repaired, many companies I visited talked about sustainability and doing good for the outdoors. As I have a background in this area I’m delighted to see that more and more outdoor brands start to act to keep our outdoor playgrounds in a good condition.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34702820614/in/dateposted/" title="Smoothies at the Houdini Booth"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4238/34702820614_4be54a8bbc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Smoothies at the Houdini Booth" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So much for now - as I said, I’ll try to dive into detail into some areas of gear and news later on.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A suitcase per person, packing, unpacking, did it all arrive at the baggage claim - family travel can be an Odyssey. We always try to travel light, but after several years of trying and testing we finally have arrived at an truly ultralight setup which allows us to use only one duffel for the four of us. Read on to find out how we achieved travel bliss!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34725054760/in/dateposted/" title="Eagle Creek Duffle packed up &amp; Pack-It System Cubes"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4243/34725054760_b484d1d906_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Eagle Creek Duffle packed up &amp; Pack-It System Cubes" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34725055540/in/dateposted/" title="Rolling on Cobblestone Streets"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4273/34725055540_a5452a183e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Rolling on Cobblestone Streets" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We have travelled with a combination of luggage - a large suitcase, my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/10/one-duffle-to-rule-them-all-the-arcteryx-carrier-duffle.html">Arc’teryx Carrier Duffles</a> or just a backpack when going for a weekend somewhere. And while all of these where fine and did get the job done - transporting clothing and stuff from A to B - it never was a perfect experience. Sometimes the suitcase got broken or something arrived late, or the most common problem that the packing for going home was more difficult because things didn’t fit in as nicely in anymore as on the way there and there was more. The solution for me seemed simple: One piece of luggage for the four of us and a set of <a href="http://shop.eaglecreek.com/pack-it-specter/l/231">Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Cubes</a> for each family member, colour-coordinated so everyone can find their clothes quickly.</p>

<p>I myself have used Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Cubes for a couple of years now and really liked them - they allowed me to pack fast &amp; easy with all garments of one kind in one cube. So getting a set for each family member seemed like a logical solution - this way everyone can pack their shirts, pants, socks and underwear together and easily finds their garments. The more difficult thing was to decide on a luggage suitcase or duffel. Because I already own three great duffels of varying size and like that especially at home they pack down to a small package, it was easy for us to keep on looking for a duffel. But what we knew we wanted was that it should have wheels so it is easier to transport - carrying a full 120l duffel is alright, but it is way more comfortable to pull it after yourself.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35071907976/in/dateposted/" title="Arrived in Frankfurt Airport"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4274/35071907976_2726dec0a8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arrived in Frankfurt Airport" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the end I picked the <a href="http://shop.eaglecreek.com/cargo-hauler-rolling-duffel-120l-xl/d/1549C3078?CategoryId=334">Cargo Hauler Rolling Duffel XL</a> - because it had wheels, is made from durable and water-resistant material AND is covered under the Eagle Creek <a href="http://www.eaglecreek.com/warranty">No Matter What Warranty</a> which <em>covers the Lifetime Warranty promise plus the added insurance of repair or replacement due to product failure during the product lifetime, regardless of the cause.</em> That means this should be for the next fifty plus years of travelling the only duffel I will ever need - and should it ever get damaged it’s easy to send it in for repairs. If you ever needed to go buy a new suitcase because your airline damaged yours you’ll appreciate this a lot!</p>

<p>At 1.587 g the Cargo Hauler Rolling Duffel XL (without the carrying straps and the storage bag - these add 254 g) is light and doesn’t eat too much into your maximum luggage allowance (on most of my flights in Europe that’s 23 kg). Part of that weight is accounted for by the durable wheels which had no problem coping with the cobblestone streets of my home town Gelnhausen in Germany where we were the last two weeks. The 120 l volume were spacious enough for us four - two adults, a toddler and a child. We even had empty space in it flying out of Finland! But what we maybe like best is how small and compact it packs away at home - because lets face it, such a duffel will be used in the best case only around six to eight weeks a year, which means it is in storage around 44 weeks a year. We had large suitcases which took too much space, but the Cargo Hauler packs down to the size of a large 2 l bottle - that is tiny, really! It packs away easily in the included bag and so is out of the way when we are at home =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34981000361/in/dateposted/" title="Plenty of space &amp; easy packing!"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4240/34981000361_db50bf9a11_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Plenty of space &amp; easy packing!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A big reason why we four were able to travel with just one 120l Duffel was that all four of us had a set of Pack-It Specter Cubes. My favourite of the bunch is by far the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/eagle-creek-pack-it-specter-compression-cube-packsack/?pid=10239">Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Compression Cube</a>. I usually pack four to five T-Shirts, an extra pants, shorts and a running shorts and shirt in these, and the zipper which runs around the cube compresses these garments to half the size. This is especially useful if I fly only with a carry-on as then space is at a premium and the Compression Cube lets me save quite a bit of space! It <a href="http://bit.ly/2qQHXOX">is also available as a Set</a> with a large Compression Cube and a Half Compression Cube, which are a good investment!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://bit.ly/2rDD6Sm">Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Garment Folder</a> is a god-send for someone like me who can not fold his button-down shirts in a good manner. The included plate lets me fold up my shirts in a clean and elegant manner so I don’t need to iron them where I arrive, which is another thing I’m not particularly good at or fond of. So anything that makes my life easier is a welcome addition! I had five shirts in the Garment Folder and there was still room for a couple more, so especially if you travel for business this one is the Pack-It Specter to get.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AthgKA8gagk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The <a href="http://bit.ly/2qQwHCm">Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Cube</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/2qUb349">Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Half Cube</a> are similar to the Compression Cube - sans compression. I pack in the Half Cube all my socks and underwear - or on some weekend trips I even have managed to only need this one to pack a shirt, boxer shorts, socks and pants. In the normal-sized Cube I pack garments which need a bit more space - an insulation jacket and hardshell for example.</p>

<p>Finally, the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/eagle-creek-pack-it-specter-shoe-sac-packsack/?pid=10239">Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Shoe Sac</a> is just one of three Cubes Eagle Creek bags to transport your shoes. The Shoe Sac is fine for a pair of sandals and an extra pair of shoes, or four pairs of kids and toddle shoes. These allow you too keep your duffel and other things in your bag clean and not get in touch with the dirt from the street or trails you’ve been running on.</p>

<p>If you like the sound of these Cubes then a good start is of course on of the <a href="http://bit.ly/2qQKpF6">Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Cube Sets</a> which gets a set of three cubes - that’s plenty for most ultralight travellers - or <a href="http://bit.ly/2sapyAv">take the set with the Garment Folder</a> if you travel a lot for business so your shirts stay in a good shape!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34301585383/in/dateposted/" title="Six Pack-It System Cubes"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4278/34301585383_098b941fd9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Six Pack-It System Cubes" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="the-bottomline">The Bottomline</h2>

<p>With the help of Eagle Creek’s genius Pack-It Specter System and their Cargo Hauler Rolling Duffel XL our little family of four can now travel with just one piece of checked luggage - an ultralight dream come true. It’s easy to pack gear at home and when leaving from the destination, and thanks to the colour-coded Pack-It Specter Cubes every family member can easily find their garments. The Compression Cubes minimize gear, the Shoe Sac keeps dirty shoes away from other garments &amp; gear and the Cube &amp; Half Cube pack garments in an organized manner. At the destination it’s easy to find shorts and socks by looking in the Cube you packed them, and packing for going home is just as simple as it was when you left! Finally, back at home the Cubes and the Duffel can be stored in a compact manner so don’t take up a lot of space!</p>

<p>Like most parents we think our two kids are active and enough outside, but a real way of measuring this assumption we did not have - until around three weeks ago. Then the ReimaGo Sensor and some compatible garments arrived at the Hiking in Finland HQ - and then there was just one thing to do: Install the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/fi/app/reimago/id1083484265?mt=8">ReimaGo App</a>, plug the <a href="https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1173541864&amp;as=1179503632&amp;t=2&amp;tk=1&amp;url=https://www.reima.com/fi/ReimaGO/ReimaGO%C2%AE-sensori/p/599160-9990">ReimaGo Sensor</a> in the <a href="https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1173541864&amp;as=1179503632&amp;t=2&amp;tk=1&amp;url=https://www.reima.com/fi/Koululaisten-lastenvaatteet/Ulkovaatteet/Ulkotakit/ReimaGO%C2%AE-softshell-takki-Hatch/p/531263-8800">ReimaGo softshell jacket</a> and… live life normally. We don’t own a car and go everywhere by bike or on foot, and so do our kids - so for us we wanted to see if during our normal, regular days our kids get enough outdoor exercise time or if we need to add more outdoor time to our schedule.</p>

<h2 id="the-reimago-sensor">The ReimaGo Sensor</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1173541864&amp;as=1179503632&amp;t=2&amp;tk=1&amp;url=https://www.reima.com/fi/ReimaGO/ReimaGO%C2%AE-sensori/p/599160-9990">ReimaGo Sensor</a> has been developed together with Suunto, another Finnish company which you might know from their high-quality wrist watches. The sensor makes use of Suunto’s Movesense technology. It’s a durable little button design that is waterproof to 30 m and attaches to compatible garments - either drop it into a small pocket or attach it to the designated place (see the underneath photo). The ideas is to use the sensor only outdoors - at least thus far the garments that the sensor connects with are all outdoor garments. This isn’t good news for kids who train e.g. indoor sports, but then nothing really stops you to put the ReimaGo Sensor just into a pocket when your child trains indoors. Maybe this is the next line of ReimaGo garments the company will launch - and with the OutDoor just a short four weeks away we probably know more soon!</p>

<h2 id="the-reimago-app">The ReimaGo App</h2>

<p>The ReimaGo App turns the tracked data into a <em>“game”</em> that sets challenges and rewards children for their efforts. The game is less PokemonGo and more just that the child is collecting through its outdoor activities <em>energy</em> which lets it move its avatar through the various levels. All there is to the game is the pushing of a button to use the collected energy to move forward, and if you finish a level there’s a short animation and you get a digital Award for the finished level. After not even three weeks our son is already in Level 7 and there’s only 15 Levels, so I reckon that some time in June we will be done - unless there’s an update which adds more levels.</p>

<p>Besides the <em>Kids side</em> of the ReimaGo App there’s also a parents side. Here you can add rewards for time spent outdoors - like an ice cream after five hours outdoors, or you can take a photo of a reward you create yourself (<a href="http://amzn.to/2qvLo06">LEGO Ninjago</a> is very popular here right now and thus makes for a great incentive to play outdoors!). This we find a good way to keep the child interested in the app - though truth be told, our son still loves to check each evening his energy of the day and his eyes go big when he sees how much time he has spent outdoors!</p>

<p>At the beginning you set a daily target of outdoor time, and we started out with the recommended 1 hour per day (= 7 hours a week). In his first week our son was triple that outdoors, so now we have raised the time to 90 minutes daily. The length of the Levels corresponds to the daily amount set; to keep these times realistic makes for a better experience for the kids, so don’t go offer the top! We also added our first reward - going to eat an ice cream - so are looking forward to see his surprise when he gets this reward!</p>

<h2 id="the-experience">The Experience</h2>

<p>We really like the whole ReimaGo experience. The ReimaGo garments - we got a pants and a jacket - are as high-quality as we are used to from Reima, and our son also likes to wear them. Easy to use, easy to clean, good fit and great freedom of movement - in short, a great jacket and pants.</p>

<p>The Sensor and App are easy to set up and use - from adding the child’s account to the app over playing the game to adding rewards - and are well made with a pleasing design for kids and adults alike. The levels are different enough to keep it exciting, and the best thing obviously is that it really makes our son want to go play outdoors so that he can collect energy. Every evening after dinner we get the sensor, open tha ReimaGo app and then see how active he was today. He then uses his collected energy to move through the level and is might proud when he has finished it - looking forward to the next day!</p>

<p>Finally, what we also like is that with the App you can add multiple kids - each with their own sensor - to it and so can keep an eye on the whole tribe’s activity. And if you yourself don’t have a fitness tracker yet, obviously nothing could stop you to get a ReimaGo Sensor for yourself to see how active you are =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34346886040/in/dateposted/" title="Active day!"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4183/34346886040_e9615a2fd6_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="Active day!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34346886190/in/photostream/" title="And an active week!"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4192/34346886190_a4386f8a1b_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="And an active week!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34600217781/in/photostream/" title="Finished another ReimaGo Level!"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4177/34600217781_1bc808afc2_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="Finished another ReimaGo Level!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="the-bottomline">The Bottomline</h2>

<p>We were sceptical if we needed an activity monitor for our son - we felt he’s plenty outside, plus attaching a sensor to our child already felt a wee bit like trying to control him. But as the Sensor really only tracks his movement and time spent outside this concern was unfounded. The ReimaGo sensor is also more child-friendly than many other fitness trackers for kids on the market as it is easy to use, affordable and durable. That the sensor is hidden in the jacket or pants also makes it less intrusive than a wristband, and the gamification of the outdoor activity makes the whole go-out-and-play idea very appealing for the small kids, in comparison to a chart of numbers which normal fitness trackers give you. It has allowed us to see how active our child is (on average 2+ hours a day, so well above what the World Health Organization recommends) and encourage him to play outdoors - even if the weather isn’t sunshine and blue sky.</p>

<p>Overall we can recommend the ReimaGo sensor if you’d like to encourage your child to go play outside or would like to find out how much time she spends outdoors. The Rewards which you can add for your child in the App - from an ice cream, a camping trip or another present - help motivate kids to go play outside and keep them interested in the App. Ultimately I feel this helps us to motivate our kids for longer hikes, bike rides and backpacking trips, and spend more quality-family-outdoor-time together =)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of 2016 I announced my intention of having a #NoGearYear - not taking in any new outdoor gear &amp; equipment, either buying it or getting it for free. Here’s the low-down on how that went.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34692167335/in/dateposted/" title="Checking out the impassable Kesch Step"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4155/34692167335_452e9e5b90_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Checking out the impassable Kesch Step" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>My intentions were simple for 2016: <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/01/zero-gear-year.html">No New Outdoor Gear</a>. I have enough of everything, from stoves over backpacks, quilts, shelters to shoes and apparel. And so I informed my partners that this gear nerd here is trying not to test &amp; use the <em>latest and greatest</em> but stick to my tried and used equipment. The months slipped by, I visited the ISPO without taking any of the free kit offered home, went on a lot of fantastic skiing trips, until <strong>BANG</strong> the post man stumbled into my house on a sunny April afternoon. While we knew each other well and he had no problems finding me in the prior years, he now asked me questioningly <em>“Hendrik Morkel?”</em>. I was just as surprised as him, as I hadn’t ordered anything. I took the parcel inside, worried about my #NoGearYear and opened it. It was a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/therm-a-rest-evolite-plus-isomatte/?pid=10239">Therm-A-Rest Evolite Plus</a> which I had inquired about in the autumn of 2015.</p>

<p>I was bummed. Does this mean I ruined my #NoGearYear? I put the pad into a corner so I didn’t needed to see it anymore and carried on like it nothing happened. Went skiing, cycling and backpacking - without that pad. But even trying to not use it it meant I had a new piece of kit in the house, a fact I couldn’t make go away even if I ignored the offender. May and June passed without visits from the post man, and then I was off to the OutDoor in Friedrichshafen. There I met Graham from <a href="http://www.cilogear.com">CiloGear</a> who told me he had a present for me. He must have seen the shock on my face as he quickly added <em>“No worries, I know about your #NoGearYear, this is just something I want to loan you!”</em>. Ah, that was better. Graham went on to explain me the prototype backpack which has ascended with its former bearer the Eiger Northface twice and established up a new route on a high mountain in Pakistan. It was a work of art and Graham’s passion for his design became evident - it reminded me of the LAUFBURSCHE backpacks which are made with the same love &amp; attention to detail. After he ran me through the bells &amp; whistles of the back he told me that he wants it back in 2017 when we meet again at the OutDoor (which is next month!). Such an arrangement worked well for me - it didn’t mean I owned a new piece of gear, but only loaned it, and that was in line with the rules I set myself.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32396336051/in/dateposted/" title="Staring off into the distance"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/443/32396336051_9d5ed3cd01_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Staring off into the distance" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Well, the next shock came some time in the late summer as the zipper of my beloved <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody</a> went broken. It was still several months till the year would turn, and so I was looking into getting the zipper fixed. Alas, in the end I just wore the broken jacket as sending the jacket to the USA to get the zipper fixed seemed just like too much hassle. So I was wearing it as long as possible, and then now in 2017 I got a new one (finally a Size S!).</p>

<p>But that pad from April - it wasn’t my only lapse, I’m sorry to admit. In the autumn two companies I really like got in touch and asked if we could work together, long-term. I was pondering between a <em>“Lets get back in January”</em> and a <em>“Lets do this!”</em> and in the end I decided that this possibility was worth pursuing, even if I had a #NoGearYear going on. After all, I felt, my goal of not buying/ taking any gear was going well, and so I told them that I’d be delighted to work with them, and thus far it has been a really good partnership. I also received a brand-new quilt which I helped test &amp; design - with some luck you’ll read about this one later this week - and tested a new headlamp from another long-term partner, so all in all I probably had about a dozen of items arrive in 2016.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34652159976/in/dateposted/" title="Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody - Broken Zipper"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4174/34652159976_fd6c3049f0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody - Broken Zipper" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="the-aftermath">The Aftermath</h2>

<p>As you see, practically I failed my #NoGearYear. Theoretically, however, I feel I won. In 2016 I gave up the two gear editor jobs I was doing which means I now can use the gear I really want to use and do not need to test different kit all the time. Another positive side effect is also that less stuff arrives here (less than ten parcels have arrived here this year!) and I can continue with less hassle to apply the KonMari principle to the stuff I own (Read <a href="http://amzn.to/2pQcqwj">The Life‑Changing Magic of Tidying Up</a> and make your life better!). I also started to charge for gear reviews on the blog if a company or PR Agency inquires if I’d like to test something or just say “No thanks”. I also was and am more outdoors, on more trips (even if you don’t read about them here yet - my other company is keeping me very busy, sorry) and spend more time with my family. So all in all this #NoGearYear has been a very positive experience for me, and I can only encourage everyone to try it, too - even if you might fail it, it should be a good opportunity to get less stuff you don’t really need and save money for trips you really want to go on!</p>
