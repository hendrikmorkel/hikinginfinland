<p>The idea of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/one-stop-shop-2019/">One Stop Shop</a> is to buy all your gear at one shop. It saves the hassle of searching many different shops, saves on shipping [which in turn is good for the environment] and also purchasing in many different currencies like £, $ and €. The downside is that if you definitely want to have those Houdini trousers and fleece and the shop you purchase everything else from doesn’t carry them, well, you might just need to pick a pants from Black Diamond, Arc’teryx or Rab instead. Ah well. Here is the list I came up with if I’d buy the equipment and apparel at many different shops instead [please keep in mind that I adjusted the prices in this table to show the actual shipping, where applicable, which I’d need to pay to get it to my home in Finland, and I converted all currencies to €]:</p>

<p>My thoughts on my own list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I picked the Hyperlite Mountain Gear 2400 Porter because it’s a pack I really like. It’s super simple yet durable and carries well. It does lack side pockets for my water bottles, but I have used this pack on plenty of trips and don’t mind to stop, put down the pack and get my water out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/as-tucas-sestrals-quilt.html">As Tucas Sestrals Quilt</a> is currently my go-to quilt when I go backpacking between spring and autumn. It’s a tad warm with the APEX 200 insulation I have, but I’m rather warm than too cold. The quilt works well with the UberLite, as I have tested on my trip in the Pyrenees last autumn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I chose a bivy + tarp as it is my favourite way to sleep outside. The weight and price is listed together, the Hyperlite Mountain Gear Echo 2 tarp on its own is 264 g and costs $ 355,00. The beauty about this setup is that it’s very versatile and can be pitched in small spaces, and works well with the trekking poles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tend to switch things up stove and cooking wise, and if the weather is good I go for my Esbit setup as it’s tiny and UL. When I go with friends, family or if the weather is crap I like to use a gas stove, too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rest of the kitchen setup is pretty much what I always have with me when I go out. The knife is the heavy stand-out, but as I often need a proper knife for starting a fire I like the Eldris.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clothing, with exception of the rain gear and the Arc’teryx Palisade Pants, is what I wear when I’m out. I have used the Palisades pants in the past and rate it high, but nowadays use the Houdini Motion Light Pants, though that one isn’t available anymore.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For rain clothes I picked what pretty much every shop has recommended, a Ultralight combination of pants and jacket which tip the scales at about 200 g. The rain jacket and pants I currently use are SIGNIFICANTLY heavier so an UL alternative like these listed are very welcome.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a La Sportiva Ambassador I picked the Mutant for 3-season use, it’s one of my favourite La Sportiva shoes around.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And then some tried and trusted accessories to help with hiking and illumination!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall this list has the potential to still cut down quite a bit of weight - there are lighter fleece jackets out there, lighter knives and backpacks, but this is gear I own and would buy again as I know it works well for me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What also becomes apparent is that I have created the most expensive list yet, at a tad over 3.000 € it is pretty pricey. Only part can be blamed on shipping costs, but e.g. picking up a bivy <strong>and</strong> cuben tarp is much more expensive than some other options which we have seen in the series.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyway, this is my Multi-Shop-Stop list! It orders gear from 8+ companies and includes gear from several companies where I am an Ambassador (Houdini and La Sportiva) and companies where I have worked together with [As Tucas, Hyperlite Mountain Gear, Therm-A-Rest, Petzl]. Nevertheless, if I’d need to go out and buy all my gear again, this would pretty much be the list!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Keep in mind that these lists are suggestions!</em> If you are already hiking &amp; backpacking you do not need to buy everything in one go but can replace gear slowly, and this lists merely should show you that you can purchase a complete Ultralight Backpacking Setup from one store - or in this case, from 8 different ones.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Usually around this time of the year I would be finalizing meetings for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqEBC4yj3FahiOhGKjMrDf0AYOmUGyDq2">OutDoor in Friedrichshafen</a>, but as last year the European Outdoor Group and it’s members voted for leaving the beautiful Lake Constance and the Alps for the busy city of Munich I will not be travelling to the European Summer show. I doubt I’ll miss much, though, as many companies will also not attend this new show.</p>

<p>I am now on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">Patreon</a>. If you feel that you get value out of my articles and videos - <strong>become a Patron for as low as a cup of coffee!</strong></p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C6qMIu-zluM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Sort of a <strong>Disclosure</strong> to start this article, though this is also a good first reason why I will not be attending the new show in Munich. I’m a Founder of the <a href="http://www.outdoor-blogger-network.com">Outdoor Blogger Network</a> and our company was an official partner of the OutDoor in Friedrichshafen. We have worked for three years with the Messe Friedrichshafen on making companies aware of the benefits of online content creators - all the Bloggers, Youtubers and Instagrammers which we welcomed on the Blogger Base, where we offered them a place to network, meet companies and fellow Influencers, write articles, edit videos, charge their gadgets and learn new things in our keynote presentations.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34734971973/in/album-72157685424312086/" title="Pata Degermann speaking on the OutDoor Stage"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4281/34734971973_84863f7014_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Pata Degermann speaking on the OutDoor Stage" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This Blogger Base and our programme - it included daily blogger walks and presentations - was a huge hit with all OutDoor Attendees. For example, over the last years we welcomed Adventurer <a href="https://www.alastairhumphreys.com">Alastair Humphreys</a>, Photographer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/harritarvainen/">Harri Tarvainen</a>, Liz Carlson, the <a href="http://youngadventuress.com">Young Adventuress</a>, and Lawyer <a href="https://cms.law/de/DEU/People/Martin-Gerecke">Martin Gerecke</a>, amongst many others. Not only did these fantastic speakers enlighten us with their talks, they also came to mingle with content creators at the Blogger Base where we had our own amazing little Café, with comfy seats for chatting and plenty of power outlets!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34734958003/in/album-72157685424312086/" title="Alastair Humphreys on the OutDoor Stage"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4213/34734958003_7e3324c12d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Alastair Humphreys on the OutDoor Stage" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now after the move was announced our company approached the Messe München and we tried to work with them on creating a similarly welcoming environment for content creators at the new show. However, the Messe München exists in a parallel universe where everything they touch is amazing and hence they decided after several talks that they don’t need OBN for the new Outdoor fair, even if this would ensure that there would be continuity in at least one aspect of the show after the move from Friedrichshafen to Munich. From my experiences at the Winter ISPO show and the <em>“Blogger Programme”</em> which is offered there I think that this will be end of a great Blogger Base, which is not only sad for our company, but especially for the content creators which have visited us at the show. So this is one reason why I will be boycotting the new show - not because I am sour that the Messe München didn’t want to cooperate with us, but also for many other reasons, which follow.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42947923162/in/album-72157670491295278/" title="Title coming soon...."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1767/42947923162_7eb80bc9a9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Title coming soon...." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="many-companies-are-not-going">Many Companies are not going</h2>

<p>The new Outdoor Show (the official name is <em>Outdoor by ISPO</em>) is a lot more expensive for companies to attend. Yes, Munich is slightly easier to reach than Friedrichshafen, but the prices are ridiculous, both for a booth at the show and for accommodation, food and transportation in the city. The costs for a booth at the new fair are significantly higher than they were in Friedrichshafen, and if you add in higher accommodation and food costs then you quickly understand why many companies are skipping the new show in Munich. No matter the location, these trade shows have lost their importance over the last years, as the shows are too late in the order cycle for many retailers to view &amp; order the new gear (this happens earlier in the year), so it is understandable that many companies skip it now where it is just a really expensive marketing event.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34702820614/in/album-72157685424312086/" title="Smoothies at the Houdini Booth"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4238/34702820614_4be54a8bbc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Smoothies at the Houdini Booth" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="i-dont-like-munich">I don’t like Munich</h2>

<p><em>Munich is such a nice city</em> is what I hear when I talk with people. Well, I disagree. It’s a massive city with millions of people, and while I have many friends there who make being in that city bearable I really don’t care much for it. It’s loud, dirty, far from nature (the English Garden doesn’t count for me) and expensive. And one of the worst things about the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/03/ispo-2019.html">ISPO</a> is always the getting there, as the Metro will be full like a tin can of sardines in the mornings and evenings. Now this is a uncomfortable experience when it is 5°C outside, but I don’t want to imagine how it will be when it is a summer-y 35°C. Sweaty, maybe?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35376626162/in/album-72157685424312086/" title="Best Booth of the Fair: The Houdini Garden"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4229/35376626162_33cd381407_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Best Booth of the Fair: The Houdini Garden" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="its-hard-work">It’s hard work</h2>

<p>Attending a trade show means for me around 10 to 12 meetings a day, running on the fair from 9 in the morning till 18 in the evening, and then usually still having some informal meetings at the After-Parties. While there always are discussions about cooperations and such at the show, I don’t really earn money with it (if we don’t count the minimal Ad Revenue from the ads on my YT Videos). Which means for me the attendance of a show was more spending money than earning with it, though at least in Friedrichshafen my costs where minimal and I could go swim in the Lake after the show.</p>

<h2 id="theres-enough-bloggers-living-in-munich">There’s enough Bloggers living in Munich</h2>

<p>Munich is home to many outdoor enthusiasts. You have the amazing <a href="https://www.munichmountaingirls.de">Munich Mountain Girls</a> (I’m a huge fan!), the wonderful <a href="https://fraeulein-draussen.de">Fräulein Draussen</a> lives close by, as well as Uli from <a href="https://www.auf-den-berg.de">Auf-den-Berg.de</a>, Andreas from <a href="https://gipfelfieber.com">Gipfelfieber</a> and many more. These great people live in Munich and it’s easy enough for them to visit the show without all the hassle and costs which such a visit would mean for me, and that means you can follow these people to find out about shiny new kit from them!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35376671012/in/album-72157685424312086/" title="New Paramo Manu Shirt"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4262/35376671012_3256998877_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="New Paramo Manu Shirt" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="i-can-go-outdoors">I can go outdoors!</h2>

<p>I am a gear-nerd, but I like being outdoors even more. Not going to the show means I can use the time to spend it with my family, go hiking and camping, play games and enjoy the summer in Finland. That’s a big plus, and another good reason for me to not go to Munich!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48043214063/in/dateposted/" title="#OutdoorCoffee!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48043214063_299e1eb743_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="#OutdoorCoffee!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="theres-always-the-new-outdoor-in-friedrichshafen-or-or-in-the-">There’s always the new OutDoor in Friedrichshafen, or OR in the 🇺🇸</h2>

<p>As you see, there are for me many reasons why I am boycotting the new Outdoor show. There’s no appreciation for bloggers and neither a good programme from the Messe Munich (when compared to what was offered at #OutDoorFN), it’s expensive to visit, many companies I want to meet are not going either, and there’s plenty of people living in and around Munich for whom it’s easier to visit the new show and test the waters. Also, there’s the new <a href="http://www.outdoor-friedrichshafen.com">Outdoor Friedrichshafen</a> Show in September and the <a href="https://www.outdoorretailer.com">Outdoor Retailer</a> in the USA which are interesting and would offer me to meet new companies and people, and both cities have amazing outdoor playgrounds on their doorstep! So all in all, I’m happy that I get to enjoy an extra summer week outdoors and save a lot of money. However, I will keep an eye out on the channels of my friends in Munich and hear what they will report, and then I might reconsider a visit in 2020 😊</p>

<p>My thoughts on the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This is the cheapest Price per g list yet, with an amazing price of 0,43 € per gram of kit!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a really good list with many items which we already have seen more often in this year’s series, like the Hyperlite Mountain Gear pack and the SMD shelter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Big 3 in this list bring together 2.500 g on the scales, with the kitchen adding 391 g and the accessories 401 g to the Baseweight of 3.292 g</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Big 3 are solid choices, with a really good <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/enlightened-equipment-revelation-quilts.html">Enlightened Equipment quilt</a>, a comfy and affordable sleeping mat, and a tent which should work well from early spring thill late autumn</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I really like the inclusion of a woodstove in the kitchen setup, the Hexagon folds flat and allows you to pick up your fuel at your camping spot instead of carrying it with you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The apparel is a light 1.701 g and it’s pretty cool to see so many new items like the Enlightened Equipment skirt and Wind Shirt, and the down jacket looks really toasty</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once more a fantastic list which is ultralight and what I like best, it has gear from over a dozen cottage manufacturers!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Keep in mind that these lists are suggestions!</em> If you are already hiking &amp; backpacking you do not need to buy everything in one go but can replace gear slowly, and this lists merely should show you that you can purchase a complete Ultralight Backpacking Setup from one store. Read Carsten’s take on this list in German at <a href="">Fastpacking.de</a>.</p>

Hailing from Slovakia and started in 2012 the shop has grown by leaps and bounds in those 7 years, and nowadays they carry some great brands, like Katabatic Gear, Ruta Locura and Westcomb, to mention just a few. Specialized on ultralight kit for any occasion, here is Outdoorline’s One Stop Shop list:</p>

<p>My thoughts on the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A complete list with clothes and everything that tops out with a Baseweight of 2.838 g is pretty great (the garments and shoes are 1.903 g)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Quilt might be a bit cold for some, but with a comfy fleece jacket and a toasty puffy jacket you can pimp the sleep setup easily to make it handle colder temperatures</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nice to see a SMD shelter in this list, it is a pretty affordable tent that’s also spacious enough to get all your kit in it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A solid Alcohol setup for the kitchen, though again I personally don’t like Titanium cups for my ☕️</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Zajo Bjorn Merino garments are new too me, though these Corespun garments look great</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Popular choices for the apparel, Cumulus, Montane and inov-8 we have seen quite a few time in this One Stop Shop Series so you know they are light and good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall an interesting list with some choices which we haven’t seen yet and also some regulars!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Henrik and the <a href="https://www.trekking-lite-store.com/sPartner=HIF2017">trekking-lite-store.com</a> are one of my oldest partners - they have been supporting me since many, many years. I <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/09/interview-henrik-ra-mann-from-trekking-lite-store-com.html">interviewed Henrik in 2010</a> as they just opened and the they were also along in the first One Stop Shop Series in 2014 - here’s <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/one-stop-shop-trekking-lite-store-dot-com.html">their list from back then</a>. Since the beginning they offered ultralight gear from the USA and big brands, and slowly more and more brands can be found at this fine shop, from Gregory to Sea to Summit to Vargo. What is also very nice is that it’s easy to sort products here, from lightest to heaviest item. So lets see what we find in this list that they sent us:</p>

<p>My thoughts on the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>With a Baseweight of 2.351 g this is a really nice light list, with a good selection of garments and shoes which make it another really light list, which is at a tad over 2k also reasonably cheap. A price per gram of 0,49 € is also quite good!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I like the choice of backpack, it’s made in Europe and packs quite a nice set of features. It’s also great to see both Cumulus and GramXpert in this list, both are small European cottages that make great gear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>EOE makes some of the lightest gas stoves on the market, and this complete kitchen setup tips the scales at 264 g, which is great. There’s some affordable &amp; light kit in this kitchen. like the Primus Spork and the Fold Cup!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A classic set of UL garments there with exception of the shoes maybe, Patagonia, Rab, OMM and Montane all are great brands which make high-quality garments and that selection should suit one well. The Columbia shoes I know Carsten will value, as he’s a fan of these kind of shoes!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And the accessories are also solid choice which are both light and also should be fairly durable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall a nice list that is easy to adapt to personal tastes or the trip at hand, be it with a larger or lighter backpack, another shelter or a different stove!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Keep in mind that these lists are suggestions!</em> If you are already hiking &amp; backpacking you do not need to buy everything in one go but can replace gear slowly, and this lists merely should show you that you can purchase a complete Ultralight Backpacking Setup from one store. Read Carsten’s take on this list in German at <a href="https://www.fastpacking.de/2019/05/16/one-stop-shop-2019-trekking-lite-store-com/">Fastpacking.de</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.walkonthewildside.de/">Walk On The Wild Side</a> is a great little online and Brick &amp; Mortar Shop in Bonn, not far away from Cologne. The owners are life-long outdoor enthusiasts and what I really like about them is that they offer many different kind of “<em>outdoor niches</em>” under one roof - from gear for Bushcrafting to Ultralight Backpacking. They also carry some brands which are hard to find in Europe, like Montbell, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/07/clikstand-first-look-video.html">Clikstand</a> and Hydrophil toothbrushes. They have affordable shipping costs to every European country and also send to the USA, Australia and Japan. So lets dive in and take a look at their list:</p>

<p>My thoughts on the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Another beautiful list which both is very light and also stays on the more affordable side of things!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Big 3 (the backpack, shelter and quilt + sleeping mat) tip the scales at 1.427 g together, which is very good. It’s nice to see Liteway gear, the Nemo Switchback and a Western Mountaineering quilt in here. Especially the latter two make for a comfortable and warm sleep setup, and the Tarp will work nicely with the Locus Gear poles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Whitebox Stove is a real classic, if you’re into alcohol stoves and like to tinker you also could make your own stove and save a bit of money. The Evernew Ti Pot is a good size, though personally I am not a fan of titanium cups like the one in this list - it’s too easy to burn your lips when you drink your morning coffee ☕️ The Opinel knives are great, and the cutlery is a real bargain!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nice to see Svala in this list! It’s a Finnish Merino brand, and I love to see all the goodness from Montbell in this list. That Plasma 1000 Down Jacket has been on my “<em>Wanna-Have</em>” list since it came out, and the wind jacket and rain garments are amazingly light. The <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/first-look-inov-8-roclite-295.html">Roclite</a> from inov-8 are great shoes for hiking, good to see their newest version in this list!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It starts to feel that we’re either seeing Black Diamond or Petzl headlamps 😂 This time it’s again the Ion, a powerful little headlamp. A compass for navigation and the Locus Gear Poles round out this list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I like this list, with a baseweight of 2.251 g (the garments are 1.884 g) it is even SUL and would allow you to carry the one or other luxury item without weighing you down too much!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Please keep in mind that these lists are suggestions!</em> You do not need to buy everything in one go if you are already hiking &amp; backpacking, and this list simply shows you that you can purchase a complete Ultralight Backpacking Setup from one store.

<h2 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h2>

<p>Ten years ago, at the beginning of April 2009, I opened up my blog at the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/archives/">hikinginfinland.com</a> domain (<em>actually, back then I was still at Blogspot, but that changed soon</em>). Why did I start my blog? Well, I’ll need to start a few years earlier for that story.</p>

<p>In 2008 I hiked with my best friend Martin on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2009/06/karhunkierros-i.html">Karhunkierros Trail</a> in Lapland. Back then I was far from hiking ultralight, and both Martin and me hiked with well over 20 kg on our backs this popular trail in Finland. On the the last day, motivated by the thought of a nice warm Sauna at home, cold beers and Pizza, we hiked as fast as possible to reach the early bus from Kuusamo to Oulu. This is where things went wrong: Sitting in our sweaty and smoke-smelling clothes in the bus, a fire alarm went on in the bus toilet - NOT caused by us 😊. The Bus pulled over, and a few minutes later it was burning with meter high flames flickering in the sky. Not only did we miss our connecting train to Tampere, but also lost all our backpacking gear which burned to ash in the luggage compartment of the bus.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40820173553/in/dateposted/" title="And it burns, burns, burns"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40820173553_4eacfc83e0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="And it burns, burns, burns" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I still loved hiking, and so decided to buy with the insurance money new backpacking gear. But I remembered that carrying 20+ kg on my back didn’t add to a pleasurable experience, and so, little by little, I found out that <a href="">ultralight backpacking</a> was a thing. So why the blog?</p>

<p>Back then the Summit &amp; Valley blog, <a href="http://www.christownsendoutdoors.com">Chris Townsend</a> and a few others were a huge inspiration for me to start blogging. I enjoyed the accounts of Bristish backpackers going out into the hills and documenting their trips, and as I felt there was no blog documenting the hiking and backpacking possibilities in Finland I registered the Hiking in Finland domain without much thought for a brand name or such. I published trip reports, gear reviews, and even made videos back in 2009 already, though they were quite different from what I produce nowadays. Together with Roger, Joe, Jörgen, Martin and Gustav we founded <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nordiclightpacking/">Nordic Lightpacking</a> and even got together to go <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/06/the-ul-fellowship.html">backpacking in Vålådalen</a> in 2010.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46997178644/in/dateposted/" title="Ultralight Backpackers!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46997178644_a578059447_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ultralight Backpackers!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Things took off for me well and magazines and companies started to ask if I could write and photograph for them. As the financial crisis from 2008 still made my work as an environmental management consultant quite hard, I decided to switch careers and have been working in this content creation, photography and outdoor business since 2011 full-time. Without this blog that wouldn’t have happened, and the amazing readers and friends I made during the last ten years helped me a lot so that I can work on my own with amazing outdoor brands, creating inspiring content from Northern Europe and across the globe. So thank you to the millions of readers who have read my articles over the last decade - it’s because of you that I am able to live this life!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46997177904/in/dateposted/" title="Cold"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46997177904_08287fb6db_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cold" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="hiking-climbing-skiing">Hiking, Climbing, Skiing</h2>

<p>… as well as Packrafting, bikepacking and trailrunning are what I do mostly nowadays. Quickly I realized that limiting myself to only hiking would mean I’d sit six months a year inside, so on came the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2011/01/backcountry-cross-country-skiing.html">XC skis</a> in winter, and since four years I also go ski touring in Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the Alps. With over 180.000 Lakes in Finland the addition of a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/08/packrafting-in-finland-first-strokes.html">packraft</a> was a logical first step, and also <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/06/bikepacking-in-pirkanmaa.html">bikepacking</a> felt like a good way to explore my surroundings.</p>

<p>I was dabbling for some years in climbing but because of having small kids I never was able to train as much as I wanted, so lately I haven’t been climbing on ice or rocks that much, but with the kids growing fast I hope to get back into that activity at some point. I did pick up <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning</a> to stay fit as I can easily go run from the front of my house, and it is an activity which also gives me a good fitness for backpacking. Yes, backpacking, the activity of hiking and camping in nature, is still one of the best things in life. Even better, I am fortunate enough to call this work, mainly because I carry a camera, tripod and notepad with me when I go out, and am able to create compelling stories, photos and videos about my trips. It is something I truly love, because not only do I know that spending time is nature is healthy in many ways, it also inspires people to protect our planet better.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>

<p><em>What is next?</em> you might think, and it is a good question. Ten years ago I already started to write and talk about the negative effects of climate change, but society was not ready for it. Now, in 2019, thanks to a 16-year old girl and the movement she has inspired, old politicians finally start to listen up and ponder the future of the human species and the planet (though I feel these old politicians simply will continue business-as-usual). I feel the time is right now for me to again start talking about how we outdoor enthusiasts can do small things which can make this planet better - from picking up other people’s trash which we find on the trail to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/03/urban-family-transportation.html">cycling more</a>, eating healthier and flying less.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40820176023/in/dateposted/" title="Dusk"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40820176023_5b9c8da3ba_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dusk" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As you might have seen on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hendrikmorkel">Youtube</a> I enjoy making videos again, and most of my reviews and trips will feature a video. I love the creativity video allows me, both in shooting and editing, and it is something that I feel better communicates what I want to say. Don’t worry, this blog will not go away. I see this blog as my home base, a sustainable and lasting place for the content I create, from the much-loved <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/the-week-in-review/">The Week In Review</a> to trip reports and other content series. As I hate Instagram and equally despise Facebook I will spend less time on these necessary evils, but you will still be able to find me on Twitter and engage with me there. I also plan to give this blog an visual overhaul. The last one is too long ago, and I hope to find the time in 2019 to give this blog the look I wish it had. Don’t worry, it will not look like every other cookie-cutter blog out there but retain it’s quirkiness, although in a slightly less 90s-internet look 😂</p>

<p>Finally, I have to thank you, my readers, for returning for so long to read Hiking in Finland. It always makes me happy when I receive tweets, comments, Emails and messages from people who went to hike somewhere because of my trip reports, bought an item because of my review or decided to make a change because one of my ponderings. It is because of you that I create content, and it means so much to me to hear that it matters to you and that you enjoy it. Thank you for reading and following me ❤️</p>

<p>If you feel like you’d like to support me and say <strong>Thanks”</strong> my content, the best way to do so is via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">Patreon</a>. It’s a monthly subscription and you can give as little as $3 per month to enable me to do what I do. As a reward you get to hang out with me on a chat server and can pick my brains on where to go hiking in Finland, what to pack and which shoes to wear, or we can discuss the latest Game of Thrones Episode! In that sense, <strong>Happy trails!</strong></p>

<p>I have shopped at <a href="https://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk">Ultralight Outdoor Gear</a> as far as ten years ago, and also have interviewed the owner <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2009/12/interview-mark-richardson-of-ultralight-outdoor-gear.html">Mark Richardson</a> back in the day. Ultralight Outdoor Gear was also along in the original One Stop Series (here’s <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/04/one-stop-shop-ultralight-outdoor-gear.html">their list from five years ago</a>) so I am happy that they are along again this year!</p>

<p>Ultralight Outdoor Gear continues to search out the lightest kit for your adventures, be they backpacking, trailrunning or adventure travel. They have a wide selection of hiking and camping gear (all ultralight!) and also carry apparel from great brands like Rab, Patagonia, Montane, Inov-8 and Haglöfs. When I have ordered from them the turn-around was always quick, and I still own and use the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2009/05/gear-talk-bushbuddy-ultra-tibetian-titanium-1100-pot.html">Tibetian Titanium 1100 Pot</a> I bought from them 10 years ago! But without much further ado, lets see what kind of list they sent us:</p>

<p>My thoughts on the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This is an amazingly light and also affordable list - the lightest and cheapest thus far!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Big 3 are 1.692 g together, and while the Kumo might be a bit small for a week long trip, the gear in this list packs really compact so it should be possible to carry equipment and food for a week in it. The Sea to Summit sleeping bag is very light, as is the Wisp which will be pitched with one of the trekking poles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m surprised to see the Soto Windmaster again - it seems to be a really good stove. The kitchen gear weighs a scant 253 g for stove, pot, cutlery, cup and water filter - if you throw in a small gas cartridge you still can stay under 500 g!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A nice selection of garments, and the Mountain Equipment Fleece Jacket especially caught my eye as it is particularly light. I probably would switch the shoes for a non-GoreTex shoe (like the <a href="https://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/equipment-c3/footwear-c78/footwear-c159/womens-trailroc-255-p8409">Trailroc</a>) but I get that in the UK it is wet and that’s why they are in there 😊</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally a shop which picks the Bindi! This ultralight headlamp packs a lot of power in a tiny package and I expect to see it replacing the eLite in the not-too-distant future. Gram Counter Gear is Ultralight Outdoor Gear’s house brand, and these carbon poles are seriously affordable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A solid list that really is ultralight with a Baseweight of 2.359 g (the garments and shoes weigh in at 1.652 g). Even if you’d want to add in a more voluminous backpack, a larger shelter or a warmer quilt you easily will be able to stay under 3 kg for your baseweight!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Keep in mind that these lists are suggestions!</em> You do not need to buy everything in one go if you are already hiking &amp; backpacking, and we merely want to show you that you can purchase a complete Ultralight Backpacking Setup from one store. Read Carsten’s take on this list in German at <a href="https://www.fastpacking.de/2019/04/26/one-stop-shop-2019-ultralightoutdoorgear-co-uk/">Fastpacking.de</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://backpackinglight.dk/?affiliate=10435">Backpackinglight.dk</a> and <a href="http://backpackinglight.se/?affiliate=10435">Backpackinglight.se</a> are owned by ultralight backpacker Kenneth Shaw which you might know from his <a href="www.ultralightandcomfortable.com">Ultralight and Comfortable</a> blog. Kenneth bought the <a href="http://backpackinglight.dk/?affiliate=10435">Backpackinglight.dk</a> domain and shop from Niels and made the range of the shop quite a bit larger over the last few years, and also nowadays offers the possibility for German and Scandinavian customers to pay via invoice at a later date. Overall I think BPL.se has a great range of brands, including many US cottages, and competitive prices. Lets take a look at the list which Kenneth has sent us:</p>

<p>My thoughts on the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Windrider is also almost ten years later still a great backpack. and my 7 year old XLite is still going strong. The Sierra Designs Cloud 800 35F sleeping bag looks comfy and is pretty light for a sleeping bag, and The One from Gossamer Gear is a classic design which GG has brought back a few years ago, and is very popular. The Big 3 weight together 2.570 g which is really good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Soto Windmaster seems to work well without a windscreen, even at a high altitude and low temperatures. Together with the Vargo Bot 700 ml it makes for a compact stove &amp; pot setup, and as usual we see a Kupilka cup and a long-handled Ti Spoon. The Sawyer Micro is a well-liked waterfilter, and that Leatherman knife is seriously light!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I love to see well-establish Scandinavian brands like Aclima and Lundhags in lists! They make fantastic garments which are long-lasting and environmentally friendly, which always is a plus in my book. It’s also great to see garments from The OMM in this list - 175 g for a rain jacket and pants is amazing, plus they are also pretty affordable!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Black Diamond Iota is used far and wide by alpinists, trailrunners and ultralight backpackers alike, and the Locus Gear Poles are some of the lightest telescope poles on the market. It’s good to see a phone on the list for navigation, this shows how far we have come in the last five years! Nowadays you can rely on your phone for navigation, photography and everything else while in the fjell, a true multi-use item thus.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Keep in mind that these lists are suggestions!</em> If you rather use your iPhone or a map and compass for navigation - that’s just fine!

<p><a href="http://alpinetrek.co.uk/?pid=10239">Alpinetrek.co.uk</a> is the British site of the well-established German online shop <a href="http://bergfreunde.de/?pid=10239">Bergfreunde</a>. I have been working together since many years with Alpinetrek and was very happy that they agreed to come on board for this series. Alpinetrek carries a wide assortment of brands, from Houdini to Patagonia, Salomon, Ortovox and Rab and also smaller brands which aren’t that well known yet. Their benefit definitely is that wide assortment, and while you won’t find many cottage brands in their shop, you still can put together a solid ultralight list. Another of their benefits is in my opinion that they carry such a large range of garments - this is great and allows you to get your hiking socks and boxershorts at the same time that you are ordering your shelter and sleeping bag! But without much further ado, here is the list which they sent us:</p>

<p>My thoughts on the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Very nice mix of brands for the Big 3. The Levity is a solid pack for beginners and experienced hikers alike, as is the sleeping setup (I expect we will see the <a href="https://youtu.be/5oXFCJi0TII">Uberlite</a> in a lot of lists this time around!). It’s nice to see the choice of a tarp for sleeping, it’s still one of my favourite ways to sleep outside. With a weight of 2.722 g for these four items the Big 3 are also well under 3 kg.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A very nice lightweight stove and kitchen Setup. The Esbit CS985 Set can use both solid fuel and alcohol to boil water, with the StS Long Spork you can eat directly from the bag, the Eldris is a solid knife which is good for all camp tasks and while the <a href="https://youtu.be/CneJY3F6zuY">BeFree Waterfilter</a> has some issues with the flask it’s a solid waterfilter which is really easy to use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole clothing setup is 2.094 g, if you subtract the rain garments which are hopefully most of the time in your pack, and some of the insulation pieces you get a worn weight of 1.311 g including the shoes! That’s really good, and as I have used some of these garments myself I can tell you also that they are really durable!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The eLite is still a good choice for summer, though I personally would like something slightly heavier and with more Lumen for spring and autumn. The <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/swix-pro-trail-carbon-120-trekking-pole.html">trekking poles are good</a> and as I myself also use the Spartan Ultra I can not find a fault in having it in this list - except it really is quite pricey.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall a very good lightweight list with a nice choice of gear. Maybe a bit pricey because of the inclusion of the Spartan Ultra, but other than that I find that a very good list which gets you lightweight on the trail in one go!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Keep in mind that these lists are suggestions!</em> If you for example rather spend a bit less and get a bit more heavy backpack like the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/11/osprey-exos-48-review.html">Osprey Exos</a> or <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/gregory-optic-48.html">Gregory Optic</a> - then it is easy to get those packs at Alpinetrek. Similarly, if you feel that you are happy with your hiking shoes or headlamp - just leave these out. <a href="https://www.fastpacking.de/2019/04/16/one-stop-shop-2019-bergfreunde-de/">Read Carsten’s take on this list in German</a> over on his blog!</p>

<p>At the end of the series I will compare all lists which each other, so definitely make sure you <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/atom.xml">subscribe</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/">follow along</a> to not miss out.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you remember the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/one-stop-shop/">One Stop Shop</a> Series from 2014 where Carsten and me reached out to a bunch of Shops and asked if they’d like to participate in creating a complete ultralight kit list from their assortment? Yes? Great! Then you’d be delighted to know that the series is back this year and we look forward to share some exciting lists with you!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40645873863/in/dateposted/" title="One Stop Shop 2019"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40645873863_2ce6a50d47_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="One Stop Shop 2019" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Five years have passed since <a href="http://fastpacking.de">Carsten</a> and me did our <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/one-stop-shop/">One Stop Shop Series</a>, and much has changed since then. Ultralight gear has become mainstream and pretty much every manufacturer offers now lightweight and ultralight alternatives of their equipment. This is great for consumers - where previously you needed to buy your quilt here, the sleeping mat there, and the backpack elsewhere nowadays you can even walk into a brick &amp; mortar store and find the lightweight gear you are searching for. This has the benefit that with some critical items like backpacks and garments you’re able to try them on before buying them, which makes returns much less likely.</p>

<p>But also the ultralight cottages haven’t been sleeping and resting on their UL Laurels - they have realized that people like to purchase their gear from a few sources instead of a dozen or more shops, and so especially we Europeans are quite lucky to have a handful of Shops which sell ultralight cottage gear all under one roof. It are these, but also more broad shops with more widely known brands, which we will showcase in this series, and I at least am very curious to see which new items will be on these lists, and which classic items we will meet again.</p>

<p>The reason for trying to purchase from one shop instead of six or more different ones is simple: You minimize shipping costs and the possibility for things to go wrong, like lost packages, long waiting times and different currencies + paying methods are all adding up to frustration when you want to buy ultralight gear in one go. Imagine you’d be able to buy all of the lightweight trekking gear you want from just one shop - <em>actually</em>, don’t imagine it - just read our articles to see that it is possible! What we do in this series is to challenge a dozen or so outdoor stores (online, brick &amp; mortar and online shops with a brick &amp; mortar shop) to send us their ideal and functional UL gear list of lightweight &amp; ultralight gear, which one can buy normally (no special orders) in their store. To make these lists easy to compare with each other and that they stay within the same boundaries, these are our Guidelines:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Creat a 3-Season gear list (Day temperature of 10 to 20°C, Night temperature of 0 to 5°C)</li>
  <li>Rain is possible every day and night</li>
  <li>Mosquitos and other insects are not an issue</li>
  <li>Tours are 5 to 7 days long</li>
</ol>

<p>These are the outlines of many classic 3-season backpacking trips, and with this one list you should be able to go hiking from spring till autumn, in Scotland, Scandinavia, China, Colorado or elsewhere. The resulting list should give you the possibility to go backpacking in warmer or colder regions with just a few little adaptations, and we are asking for suggestions for the following items:</p>

<p><strong>The Big 3</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Backpack</li>
  <li>Sleeping bag or quilt</li>
  <li>Mattress</li>
  <li>Shelter</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Ultralight Kitchen</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Stove</li>
  <li>Pot (if not included with Stove)</li>
  <li>Cutlery</li>
  <li>Knife</li>
  <li>Cup</li>
  <li>Waterfilter</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Getting Dressed</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Baselayer T-Shirt</li>
  <li>Longsleeve</li>
  <li>Trekking pants</li>
  <li>Fleece jacket</li>
  <li>Insulation jacket</li>
  <li>Wind jacket</li>
  <li>Rain pants</li>
  <li>Rain jacket</li>
  <li>Shoes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>(Head-) Lamp</li>
  <li>Trekking poles</li>
  <li>Navigation/ Electronics</li>
</ul>

<p>The first four items are the big three (sleep system, backpack and shelter) which weigh the most and where one can save the most weight when lightening up. The kitchen is something many of us like to thinker with and everyone has their preference - the speed and efficiency of a gas stove, the super ultra light weight of an alcohol stove, or the relaxing fire of a woodstove. As most of us do not hike naked it’s good to get dressed, and finally we also need some accessories for our trips. The first article goes online tomorrow, and then we will publish them as be get them throughout the following weeks.

<p>As part of me trying to minimize my environmental footprint but unwilling to not ski I travelled last weekend by train and bus to Ruka-Kuusamo, some 500 kilometres from Vaasa away. Even with short stop-overs between switching from the train to the Bus it’s almost a 10 hour journey to get to Ruka, though as you can walk around in the train, there’s good internet and you can work there’s nothing to worry about. Though I was happy that I was able to get out on the hills once I arrived in Ruka, and with the lifts being open till 19 o’clock I got in a few hours of skiing on the slopes after a full day of travelling - not a bad start! And to make it even better, it had been snowing the whole Thursday and would continue throughout the night.</p>

<p>After the skiing I went to have Dinner at <a href="https://ruokburger.fi">RUOK Burger</a> which is just next door from my apartment in the <a href="https://www.ski-inn.fi/en/majoitus/ruka">Ruka Village Ski-Inn</a>. Their Portobello Burger was the only vegetarian option and super-tasty, and I accompanied it with a local Craft Beer from Rovaniemi, a nice Amber Lager. After that I retired to my cozy apartment, heated up the Sauna and watched how it was snowing outside. Being on ski holidays it is always great to watch it snow ❄️ as that means fresh powder the next day when you’re outside on the hills!</p>

<p>The next morning a bright blue sky woke me up, and all signs were on an amazing day on and off the slopes. There’s just something great about hitting the slopes and being one of the first ones there. I love painting my curves into the still un-shredded corduroy, and then Veera and me went into the side-country to look for some powder. And powder we found.</p>

<p>It really feels amazing to surf through the fluffy snow and throw up big swoops of the white gold. Veera and me both had big smiles on our faces after cruising through the powder-filled forests, so once it was noon we went to <a href="http://www.hankibaari.fi">Hanki Baari</a> for lunch, where I ate a tasty vegan Mie Goreng. Hanki Baari is either way an amazing place to chill after a day on the slopes, listening to music and drinking some fancy beers, though right now we just needed some good nutrition before hitting the slopes again.</p>

<p>So, after a coffee ☕️ it was time to go ride some more. After all, the sun was shining, the slopes were in prime condition and the lifts would be running till 23 o’clock (Fridays the Ruka Ski Resort’s lifts run so late because those who journey after work to Ruka still can hit the illuminated slopes!). However, we wouldn’t ski that long, as we had another plan.</p>

<p>We went on a little powder hunt with friends of Veera, which resulted in a short but exhausting climb through hip-deep snow back to the slopes from the lake 🤣 After that I went for a few more laps on the slopes before calling it a day. A quick shower later I was sitting in the <a href="https://www.pizzeriaruka.fi/en/">Pizzeria Ruka</a> which is probably the best Pizza you can get in Ruka. It’s a five minute stroll from the centre of the village to the Pizzeria, and their wood-fired oven served me in no time a delicious Tartufo Pizza. That’s exactly what I needed after almost six hours of skiing, and gave me enough energy for the hike we had planned for the evening.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://www.hendrikmorkel.com">photographer</a> I hate it to spend a gorgeous sunset inside, so I was happy that Veera and her dog were up for a sunset mission to Konttainen, a hill some 10 minutes away from Ruka. A steep 11 minute climb later we were on the top of Konttainen, and strolled towards the best spot in the house while the show was just starting. It’s soooooo much better to be outside in nature when the sun sets than sitting inside, and this definitely was an evening well spent. After the sun disappeared from view we gazed for a while onto the illuminated slopes of Ruka, and for a moment I was tempted to jump back into my <a href="http://bit.ly/2D2JtFL">ski boots</a> and go for some night skiing. But then I remembered my warm Sauna and the cold beer which were waiting for me, so I skipped the night skiing and relaxed in my apartment before calling it a night.</p>

<p>The next morning white clouds hung over the mountain and gave the slopes and village a sci-fi feel. I’s the kind of weather where you ponder if you should just stay inside and chill-lax, but as I wanted to get my skis on that didn’t happen and early on Saturday morning Veera and me where again on the slopes, searching for some untracked pockets of powder.</p>

<p>And slowly but surely the sun was burning through the clouds and as the day progressed the views came out again, and we also were lucky by finding some fine lines of untouched powder not far from the hustle and bustle of the slopes.</p>

<p>After all that off-piste skiing it was time to join the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/ski-pride">Ruka Ski Pride</a> Parade. I really ❤️ that Ruka has this event which celebrates equal rites and diversity on the slopes, and the vibe was so positive and fun - I really enjoyed to be part of it 🌈 Besides this parade there were inclusive events the whole weekend, with concerts and DJs, and of course some good skiing!</p>

<p>And then the day was almost over again. But not before I skied one final time from the East to the West, and from the North to the South across the whole resort. I love to ski fast and go from one end of a resort to the other one, shredding down the slopes and throwing up clouds of slushy spring snow, and at the end of this Saturday my trusty <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/suunto-spartan-ultra-black-multifunktionsuhr/?pid=10239">Suunto Spartan Ultra</a> told me I had skied almost 50 km of distance this day, and I could tell by how my legs felt.</p>

<p>After some relaxing I met Mats for Dinner at <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/villisika">Villisika</a> from where you have the best view over the slopes, so while we were eating we could see how the snow groomers got the hill ready for the next day. Sadly, the next sunny day I wouldn’t be shredding the groomers, as I was sitting in the train and bus back south. But I have a feeling that I will travel North once more for more skiing before the winter truly ends ❄️</p>

<h2 id="spring-skiing-in-ruka">Spring Skiing in Ruka</h2>

<p>As you can see above, winter isn’t over just yet in Finnish Lapland, even if it may feel like it here in the south where most of the snow is already gone. Until early May there’s plenty of great skiing to be had in Northern Finland, and if you’re like me and can not get enough of skiing and winter then you too should steal away for a weekend to Ruka for some spring skiing. The slopes in <a href="https://www.ruka.fi">Ruka</a> are open till early May, and between now and the closing of the slopes there’s every weekend a weekend of fun to be had: Next weekend, from the 11.4. - 14.4.2019 is the legendary <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/spring-break">Ruka Spring Break</a> which will enlighten those who like to Party between hitting the groomers. The <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/easter">Easter Weekend</a> has winter activities for the whole family on offer, and the first of May is the traditional <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/wappulounas">Wappulounas</a>, a get-together of the international snowboard community on the slopes of Ruka. So don’t ponder longer - go and get some of that spring snow!</p>

<h2 id="where-to-stay">Where to Stay</h2>

<p>I stayed at the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/rukasuites">Ski Inn</a> and liked my apartment in the centre of the village. It was a two minute stroll to the Gondola and lift, a one minute walk to the supermarket, and Hanki Baari was even in the same building so I didn’t had to go far for a beer! There’s plenty more <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/where-to-stay">places to stay in Ruka</a> for any budget, and if you’re pondering where to eat: Just follow my recommendations above or try any of the other restaurants in the village and it’s surroundings.</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-ruka">Getting to Ruka</h2>

<p>The most convenient way is to take the <a href="http://vr.fi">train</a> and <a href="https://matkahuolto.fi">bus</a> to Ruka, or if you come from abroad you can fly to the <a href="https://www.finavia.fi/en/airports/kuusamo">Kuusamo Airport</a> and take the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/getting-around">Ski Bus</a> to Ruka. On the train you can sleep, work and walk around, and during the bus trip you can enjoy the beautiful Finnish landscape while listening to your favourite tunes.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Riding bikes is fun and healthy. Too bad too many people drive cars in our cities. <strong>Cars don’t belong in cities</strong> is a thought which we share in our family. Cars have their place, but for both humans and the environment, and also the aesthetics of our towns, it would be best if most of us would cycle to the grocery store, work and the cinema. That that is possible I want to show you in this article.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>I admit that <strong>#FuckCarsRideBikes</strong> is probably the best Hashtag I have invented. I dislike cars as they illustrate what is wrong with our cities &amp; towns: Everywhere we have multi-lane streets so that thousands of people who sit <em>alone</em> in their car can drive from A to B. What’s wrong about this is that the distances these people drive <strong>ALONE</strong> in their cars is statistically less than 5 km, or the distance which most of the readers of this blog hike in an hour in the hills or would be able to ride on a bike in 20 to 30 minutes. Add in that nowadays seemingly every other car driver is distracted while checking his or her phone, our ageing societies mean that there are more people who are physically less able to drive <strong>safely</strong>, and the emissions from cars which are bad for our health and you start to realize that we need to get rid of the majority of cars in cities and towns. That that is possible and that one can thrive without a car and <strong>get everything done</strong> is what I want to show today, and hopefully encourage you to ride more on your bike and drive less in your car.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-from-a-to-b">How to get from A to B</h2>

<p>The kids have hobbies, need to be brought to school and kindergarden, there’s the occasional thing to pick up at the post office and groceries for cooking at home also need to be bought and brought home. Add in a visit to the cinema, going for lunch with colleagues, <a href="https://youtu.be/v0ae-3BQzFM">playing games with friends</a>, swimming at the beach and oh, yeah, showing up at the office for work is also smart. <strong>Can one <em>REALLY</em> do all that by bike?</strong> Well, yes 😊</p>

<p>Statistically most people use their cars for journeys of three to five kilometre in length, which if you think about it, is insane. I ride with my kids, with the trailer behind me and my son on his own bike, in 15 minutes to the centre of Vaasa, which is about three kilometre away from our house. Pretty much all of it is on cycling lanes, and in the centre there’s dozens of parking places for bikes so one never needs to ponder “Where do I park?”. It’s also free! If the weather is poor hardshells come on - living in a coastal town (= lots of wind, 🌬💨 all the time) means we are used to wearing a <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/windproof-jackets/?pid=10239">wind jacket</a> when we go outside - and when you arrive at the Café, Restaurant or school you take it off. No problem!</p>

<p>This is not some kind of magic that only we can achieve. Most people have very short commutes and can do all of it by riding a bike, and did I mention that being on a bike is healthy and fun? I at least always feel very happy when I can ride my bike. I think the biggest hurdle to those who drive with a car everywhere is that they think that they can not cycle. The truth is - if you have learned to ride a bike, and own a bike, then you can bicycle. No one is expecting you to win the <a href="https://www.transcontinental.cc">Transcontinental Race</a> or going <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/active-holidays-in-are-sweden.html">Downhill mountain biking</a> but you likely just want go to the Café or to the beach. You also don’t need to sell your car and go all in, but gradually try what you all can do by bike. Cycle to work two days a week, instead of taking the car to the gym take the bike to go grocery shopping, and if you want to go out and meet friends why not go cycle to that lovely Café instead of taking the car? If you slowly phase out the use of a car you’ll see that going by bike everywhere is easy - and not just for adults, also kids love to ride their bike. The smile my 3 year old daughter gives me when we cycle together is amazing, and while this obviously only are short distances like going to the Kindergarden, the playground and the library bus, it still allows her to get used to cycling. For longer distances she sits in the Thule Chariot, which is also great to transport stuff. And if it doesn’t fit on the bike or in the trailer I take the bus or use a Taxi. By not owning a car we save a minimum of 400€ per month on car-related expenses, and that are even in Finland quite a few Taxi rides.</p>

<h2 id="the-bikes">The Bikes</h2>

<p>Now I have been talking so much about our bikes - time to take a look at them! I have written before about my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/pelago-bicycles-stavanger.html">Pelago Stavanger</a> which I am now riding since five years. I bought for my wife some years ago a <a href="https://www.pelagobicycles.com/bicycles/airisto-commuter.html">Pelago Airisto</a> which she loves, and with both of these bikes we can pull the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/thule-chariot-cross2-kinderanhaenger/?pid=10239">Thule Chariot 2</a> where our daughter sits and rides with us. The Airisto is a fantastic bike and I got my wife the front basket as it makes transporting things so much easier. The Airisto also performs well for bike tours - we cycled for a week on Åland with these bikes and had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Our son is on his fourth bike, and since about a year he is riding the <a href="https://woombikes.com/products/4?ls=en">woom 4 children’s bike</a> which has been his best bike to date. It’s not just light and grew with him, it also has 8 gears which made cycling up hills and in winter a lot easier. The bike handles very well (especially if compared to his older bikes) and it’s a pleasure to see him ride his bike proudly and having fun. A good bike which is the right size and easy to use makes all the difference in getting a child being willing to ride a bike year-around, from spring till winter, and the woom 4 certainly has made it easier for us parents to go cycling together - because the bike works flawlessly. We also have cycled some longer rides around Vaasa with him, and thanks to his woom bike he’s able to cycle up to 20 km without a problem.</p>

<p>Our son is wearing the <a href="https://woombikes.com/products/woom-helmet?ls=en">woom Helmet</a> which is good, though it’s not really made for the cold weather of Finland and the width adjustment knob broke in the middle of winter - we have been using the Helmet now in the max. size, which is either way what we needed. It’s a light and well-ventilated helmet and stands up to daily use. Similarly the <a href="https://woombikes.com/products/woom-radlicht">woom bike lights</a> had a battery which had problems coping with the Finnish winter, it only worked on a charge for a day or two max and then needed recharging, though I imagine this is not a problem in warmer climates. And we also got the easy to use <a href="https://woombikes.com/products/woom-radschloss?ls=en">woom chain lock</a>. You can put in your own code (and can change it easily, too) so that way the bike can always be securely locked when at school or in town.</p>

<p>The Thule Chariot 2 is an amazing trailer and honestly the most important piece of cycling gear for a family with small kids which wants to rely less on the car. The <a href="http://bit.ly/2FxaMIU">Chariot 2</a> has allowed us to transport both kids at the same time when they were younger, we can use it to transport large packages and it makes grocery shopping a breeze as you can fit a child and the groceries for a week in it with room to spare. We also have travelled with the bikes and the trailer on <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/08/cycling-and-bouldering-on-aland.html">Åland</a> which was an amazing trip which combined the bikes, train and ferry for a lovely week of cycling in the Archipelago. The Thule Chariot also has flown with us when the kids were smaller, as it can be converted into a pram in one minute (or a sled if there’s enough snow!). This really is an amazing piece of equipment which is integral to our family not having a car, and I can foresee that even when our 3-year old daughter is old enough to cycle herself that we might keep the trailer for a while as it is so damn easy to transport large things with it.</p>

<p>Speaking of transporting, my <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/adventure-touring-bikes/920/920/p/21996/">Trek 920 Disc</a> has been an amazing bike for both transporting, urban commutes, fun rides and adventures. I can transport an unreasonable amount of stuff on it thanks to the two racks, and especially the front rack is one of the best things on a bike, ever (<em>Seriously, if there’s one thing you should get for your bike it is a front rack!</em>). I love this bike and even more after I made it <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/08/schwalbe-tubeless-easy-kit.html">tubeless</a> two years ago. If it would allow me to pull the Thule Chariot I probably would own only this one bike.</p>

<p>As we are a family and we have to transport kids, groceries and parcels every now and then, I think you understand why we are dreaming of a Cargobike. <a href="https://www.bakfiets.nl">There’s</a> <a href="http://www.larryvsharry.com">just</a> <a href="https://yubabikes.com">too</a> <a href="https://sblocs.bike">many</a> <a href="http://www.workcycles.com">options</a> and they’re also all a bit pricey, but maybe in the future we will change from the Thule Chariot to a Cargobike for transporting…</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40115659892/in/album-72157665520832018/" title="SBlocs Cargo Bike"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4720/40115659892_5b5a2abb36_b.jpg" width="1024" height="806" alt="SBlocs Cargo Bike" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then there’s the kick bike which our kids used when they were small. We had a <a href="https://www.puky.de/en/home">Puky</a> kick bike for both kids, and our daughter has been riding it since she was 1,5 years old. It’s something she really enjoys a lot and she is pretty good at it, and when we go to the playground, for a walk or to the library bus she takes the kick bike as that way the longer distances are no problem for her.</p>

<h2 id="come-rain-come-sunshine-we-ride">Come Rain, come Sunshine, we Ride</h2>

<p>Riding our bikes in any weather - from damn slippery roads to the rain and hot 30°C days - needs a little planning garment-wise, though as you’re likely a backpacker or skier you have everything you need to ride in any climate. We just use our hiking garments for cycling, the most important thing is that they have a good freedom of movement. A wind or rain jacket and a rain pants are needed in foul weather, while in the summer we cycle in shorts and T-shirts. My wife and kids use a Helmet while I only use one on long bike rides - because <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/news/a24110027/bike-helmet-safety/">it’s OK to not wear a helmet</a>, as bicycle lanes make cycling safe and not a helmet. <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/gloves/recommended-use--cycling/?pid=10239">Windproof gloves</a> make sure your hands don’t freeze solid (they’re also recommended in windy summers as warm hands make cycling a lot more fun).</p>

<p>That’s really it what ones need to transporting oneself from A to B by bicycle - yes there’s lots of fancy things one can add to the bike but a basic bike, some gloves, maybe a helmet and depending on the weather a wind or rain jacket are all that is needed. In the future I’ll write more about useful accessories for cycling, but that’s not the focus of this post!</p>

<h2 id="cant-do-without-car">Can’t do without car?</h2>

<p>If you can not be without a car - because you actually life far away from civilization - I would encourage you to at least not drive alone. Share a car with a neighbour or two, drive together, make less trips and if your car is old get a car which is fuel-efficient or is an electric car. Generally, sharing the car and driving together makes the use of a motorized vehicle more acceptable. Alternatively you could try a e-Bike as these allow you to go a bit faster and further without too much of your own muscle power, or have a look at something like the <a href="https://www.arcimoto.com">Arcimoto</a> if it needs to be a vehicle.</p>

<h2 id="go-ride-your-bike">Go Ride Your Bike!</h2>

<p>I hope you see it is easy, fun and healthy to not drive everywhere in a car and that using the bike for transportation in an urban environment makes a lot of sense. There’s no searching for a parking spot, you don’t need to go to the gym, you’re outside at the fresh air and are having fun. Having good bikes for the kids and getting them used from an early age to cycling helps to instil a happiness to bicycle everywhere in them, and also makes them more independent as you as a parent don’t need to drive them everywhere. So in conclusion I hope that you now, with the beginning of spring, try to cycle more! After all - it’s fun, healthy and allows you to be more outside, and isn’t that what we all enjoy the most?!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44199759745/in/album-72157673511250268/" title="Storådörren Valley from the other side n better weather"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1903/44199759745_b4b7e1753e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Storådörren Valley from the other side n better weather" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>This article is part of the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/?pid=10239">Bergfreunde</a> Series of “Sustainable Outdoors” and several bloggers write about this topic - you can find a list with the other articles at the end. We are not paid to write these articles and have full editorial control.</em></p>

<p>Going outdoors feels like a sustainable hobby - especially if you compare it to sports and hobbies which need large buildings or areas to be played &amp; practiced. But is it really sustainable to drive in a big car to a trail head, being dressed in garments made from oil-based materials and hiking in sensitive areas which contributes to land erosion and degradation? That is a question which I am pondering in this article, so read along to find out what in my opinion are our biggest “sins” as backpackers.</p>

<h2 id="getting-there">Getting there</h2>

<p>Only very few of us life in nature and can start hiking or skiing from their doorstep - most of us life in towns and villages and need to travel to the start of a trail or to the hills. Those who read me since a while know that I neither have a driving license and our family also does not own a car. If I go backpacking somewhere it is always by public transportation, most usually a combination of train and bus when in Finland, or by ferry, plane and then bus or train when abroad. As I have been travelling like this since 20 years this is normal for me, but for those who have grown up with a car in front of their house this might seem strange. Yes, I am dependent on schedules and trains and busses to get somewhere, but I have learned to life with that and it usually works out nicely. My waiting time I use for reading and studying the map, or stocking up on calories!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/33621497524/in/album-72157681559831330/" title="Bikepacking Season is upon us!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4160/33621497524_40fe81d861_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Bikepacking Season is upon us!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Getting to a local trail here in Pohjanmaa means either jumping on a bike or taking a bus or train and possibly a Taxi. Sometimes I make the bike ride part of the journey and just call it a <em>Bikepacking and Hiking Adventure</em> as cool and catchy names are important =) I really love to ride my bike and it’s my favourite way to get around when in town or if I’m travelling, it just feels great. Going by train or bus is fine, though - I can charge my phone and listen to music or chat on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">Discord</a> and the speed is good and if going by bus I usually also can get off quite close to a trailhead and just hike the last bit.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44739826010/in/dateposted/" title="Golden Hour"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7863/44739826010_b8ec02619e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Golden Hour" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>When going abroad flying is something I hate. I hate the noise, the people and the emissions I accumulate while travelling by plane, but for long distances in a short time there’s no alternative for me right now. I am cutting down on my flights and assignments abroad drastically, though, and each trip I can realize by taking the ferry, train, bus and Taxi are a win in my book. Plus going by plane also often means I have to add a night in an <a href="https://www.airbnb.ca/c/hmorkel">AirBnB</a> or Hotel at the beginning or end, depending on the connections at the destination to get where I want to go which adds to the costs and length of a trip. But some trips are just too good to miss out on, like my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/06/hiking-the-causeway-coast-way.html">Causeway Coast Way thru-hike</a> or backpacking on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/10/snow-and-sunshine-on-the-via-dinarica.html">Via Dinarica</a> in Bosnia Herzegovina. These were amazing hikes and totally worth getting into a plane for, and also the John Muir Trail is high on my list, as well as several other trails abroad.</p>

<p>My take-away for <strong>getting there</strong> is probably to try to enjoy your local outdoors as much as possible. I know I am guilty of dreaming and hiking on distant trails, while I have a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/pack-sail-rafting-in-the-kvarken-archipelago.html">UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site</a> on my doorstep which would be great for packrafting, cycling and hiking. But the benefits of hiking locally are so many: You can hike more - have a free afternoon and day ahead? Just go to a local trail for a night out! Take the bike instead of the car if you feel like it, and for longer trips why not explore more of your own country?! If you fly somewhere for your yearly long backpacking trip - and you can! - <a href="https://mossy.earth/collections/carbon-offsetting">offset your emissions</a> by supporting reforestation measures or similar.</p>

<h2 id="the-gear">The Gear</h2>

<p>Another topic which we have to ponder is how sustainable our outdoor gear is. Unless you use exclusively natural materials like cotton, hemp, flax, wood or Merino wool chances are you have something that’s made from oil =&gt; plastic in any form or shape (it can be called Dyneema, XPac, Cuben fibre, Polyester, Nylon, Cordura or or or). The good thing is that most of our outdoor gear is so well made that it can last us a life-time with some proper care, so the environmental footprint of a tent which gets used several times per year is relatively small after 15 years of use.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9797321574/in/album-72157634403205347/" title="HMG UltaMid in a wet forest"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5502/9797321574_0b9435d015_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="HMG UltaMid in a wet forest" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Also, most new outdoor equipment is made from recycled or recyclable materials which is an amazing step forward. I remember my first <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/07/outdoor-news-i.html">OutDoor</a> where the sustainability topic was still in it’s baby shoes and I had more the feel of “Greenwashing” here and there. But now, five years later, it’s front and centre for many companies, and one of their most important messages. From <a href="http://bit.ly/2UNDeN1">Patagonia</a> who doesn’t want you to buy their jackets to Houdini which lets you <a href="https://www.houdinisportswear.com/ca/sustainability/houdini-rental">rent their garments</a> instead of buying them, many companies wake up and realize we need to do something to keep our outdoors healthy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46495574344/in/album-72157678997220548/" title="100%"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7826/46495574344_e4e77a6ca4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="100%" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But what’s even better is that many of our outdoor gear also can find it’s way into our everyday life. Don’t be dumb and only use your <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/hydro-flask-standard-mouth-with-standard-flex-cap/?pid=10239">Hydroflask</a> on the trail - take it with you when you go to work or walking the dog! Get a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/primus-vacuum-commuter-mug-isolierbecher/?pid=10239">good mug</a> for your coffee on the go, and also your lunch can be packed in a Light My Fire meal box. I also wear my outdoor clothes all the time - my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/houdini-womens-thrill-twill-mtm-pants-jeans/?pid=10239">hiking pants</a> are my every day pants as well, when I pick up my kids I wear my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Alpine Start Hoody</a> or a shell jacket and I don’t really use any other shoes than my trailrunning and hiking shoes. If you’re working at a office where a suit is mandatory you might not get away with wearing your outdoor garments all the time, but if your employer is relaxed about the dress code there’s no good reason why you can’t wear your flannel shirt and hiking trousers to the office.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47298836431/in/dateposted/" title="Time for some Coffee!"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7857/47298836431_ab751f6d7a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Time for some Coffee!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Finally, instead of buying a new piece of kit once an old one is broken might not be necessary - many pieces of equipment can be fixed, from stoves to garments. If a rain jacket doesn’t keep the rain out anymore it often just needs a wash with a good detergent to re-activate its waterproof properties, and if a tear is too big you can have it often much more cheaply fixed than buying a new one.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35450694064/in/album-72157686898441076/" title="Unscrew everything!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4307/35450694064_e2e659e43d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Unscrew everything!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="land-degradation">Land degradation</h2>

<p>Land degradation and erosion is especially a problem at very popular trails and areas - from the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2009/06/karhunkierros-i.html">Karhunkierros</a> in Finland to certain trails in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/a-lake-district-traverse.html">Lake District</a> and elsewhere, where a lot of people hike or ski the earth under our feet gets eroded and with rain and wind popular trails quickly can look like deep scars in the landscape. Well built and maintained trails minimize this problem, and also we can - by choosing to hike on “less popular” trails. Now less popular does not equal less beautiful, and as many of us go into nature to escape busy cities it’s a smart thing to search out these less popular trails and enjoy them on your own.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29831354255/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Clearing up"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8528/29831354255_4688f96fa0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Clearing up" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If a trail gets really popular then trail erosion is often the smallest problem - often rubbish which is left behind, from 💩 to plastic bottles and tissues - are a much bigger issue. What we as knowledgable outdoors men and women can do is to educate our fellow hikers when we catch them in the act, or collect the trash and carry it out. Carrying a small Ziplock bag for these situations is common for me, because I really hate it to see rubbish left in nature.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14221050166/in/album-72157644166894052/" title="The Old Man of Coniston"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5489/14221050166_7c850e257d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="The Old Man of Coniston" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline--what-you-can-do">Bottomline &amp; What you can do</h2>

<p>My conclusion is that being outdoors, be it hiking, backpacking, biketouring, packrafting or ski-touring is inherently a sustainable activity. By spending time outdoors in nature we learn to care more about our planet, and in the long run we will adapt many of the things I have suggested throughout this article, though if you’re at the start of your hiking career and just started with backpacking you can now of course skip ahead and pick up these good behaviours and ideas!</p>

<p>To sum them up, these would be my three take-aways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Adventure more locally and take the bike, train and bus to get to the trailhead!</li>
  <li>Use your gear until the end! Resist the urge to buy new gear, repair what you have and consider renting or buying used gear.</li>
  <li>Search out less popular trails, keep <em>Leave No Trace</em> principles in mind and pick up other people’s trash if you encounter it outdoors.</li>
</ol>

<p>I also want to encourage you to not geo-tag your images online and generally share &amp; spend less time on un-social networks like Instagram and Facebook which both promote <strong>F</strong>ear <strong>O</strong>f <strong>M</strong>issing <strong>O</strong>ut and other negative feelings. Finally, <a href="https://twitter.com/gretathunberg">#FridaysForFuture</a> are not just for kids - also responsible Adults who are not happy about how those in our governments misuse their loaned power can take to the streets and demonstrate for politics which ensure our planet, including all these amazing National Parks, hiking trails and mountains remain for future generations. Take the ext Friday off and go demonstrate!</p>

<p>This Opinel N°08 Black Oak was my favourite piece of hardware on the show. It’s lightweight (45 g) and simply beautiful. It felt great in my hand and I think I want to pick one up.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376394441/in/dateposted/" title="Opinel for Kids! | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7827/47376394441_854312d114_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Opinel for Kids! | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Also the other goods from Opinel were top notch and especially the two sets for kids were amazing, as a father of a seven year old boy I really loved the wood carving set which lets the child build a small sail boat. Similarly, the kitchen knife set allows the kids to help safely in the kitchen - and cooking together is a lot of fun!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46653258814/in/dateposted/" title="Marttiini Damast Puukko | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7926/46653258814_77c2f67a99_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Marttiini Damast Puukko | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Also this Marttiini Damast Steel puukko was a work of art, Made in Finland. The birch handle is waxed and felt really good in my hand, and damast steel with it’s intriguing patterns is always an eye-catcher.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376395151/in/dateposted/" title="Swiza Knives | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7818/47376395151_22f4f4e076_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Swiza Knives | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Apparently <em>All Black</em> is a trend in the knife industry, also also the Swiss Brand Swiza had an All Black pocket knife. This one felt lightweight and could be a good knife for weight-conscious backpackers.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46461346595/in/dateposted/" title="Swiss Army Knives | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7846/46461346595_d62333c63c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Swiss Army Knives | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376420661/in/dateposted/" title="Victorinox Pocket Knives | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7867/47376420661_325faa6b7b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Victorinox Pocket Knives | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At Victorinox a person was showing some visitors how to carve with the knife in the middle, and it was interesting to watch. This Swiss Brand had a wide array of different knives, and it seems even some collectors editions.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376393431/in/dateposted/" title="Leatherman | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7896/47376393431_4ae59967c9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Leatherman | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47323558742/in/dateposted/" title="Mora Kniv Hook Knife | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7881/47323558742_2ea4e0497d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Mora Kniv Hook Knife | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47323558342/in/dateposted/" title="Mora Kniv Hook Knife | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7867/47323558342_729f99b76d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Mora Kniv Hook Knife | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And at Morakniv they were very proud of their new hook knife for carving, and it’s a great - and <strong>SHARP</strong> - knife for sure. This knife now finally comes with it’s own leather pouch which protects it during transport, which is a good thing. Also I learned that Mora produces some insane amount of knives each day - 20.000 to be exact!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376420281/in/dateposted/" title="Silky Saw | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7828/47376420281_bd5b354f70_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Silky Saw | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As I have around my house a large pine hedge which I cut once a year, a good saw is mandatory in our house. I checked out the Silky Saws booth and these Japanese saws looked amazing, I feel when my Fiskars saw is at the end of it’s life cycle I might replace it with a Silky one.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376402221/in/dateposted/" title="Damast Hultafors Axe"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4904/47376402221_68c3e95c90_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Damast Hultafors Axe" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376401981/in/dateposted/" title="Hultafors Axes"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7825/47376401981_5725ffa8b5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Hultafors Axes" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Hultafors from Sweden makes Axes since a loooong time, and their Hultån, Åby and Ågelsjön hatchets felt amazing in hand. Sadly they didn’t have any wood for splitting along, but I am pretty sure these axes are up to the task! Oh, and that Damast Axe - it’s a unique piece which is unlikely to see mass production, and with a price tag of around 2.000€ it’s also more likely an Axe which you’ll hang on your wall than using it in the forest.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40410897873/in/dateposted/" title="FixPlus Straps"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7833/40410897873_2b65657106_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="FixPlus Straps" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40410897363/in/dateposted/" title="FixPlus"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7872/40410897363_086a38ae9e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="FixPlus" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I met the guys from FixPlus which make lightweight straps with which you can connect your gear to all kinds of stuff - from closing your cook kit securely to attaching your skis to your bike, these are multiple use and lightweight - and unlike the classic Voilé straps more durable and UV resistant.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47323561142/in/dateposted/" title="IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7869/47323561142_8c23490be8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="616" alt="IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46461352175/in/dateposted/" title="Fjällräven"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7888/46461352175_2e571a86b5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="667" alt="Fjällräven" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Fjällräven was with their sister companies at the fair and their new hunting trousers looked amazing - both very comfortable and made for a good time in the outdoors, in any weather. I liked the pattern, too, and imagine that we will see many people wear these for normal backpacking and hiking.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47323554502/in/dateposted/" title="Savotta Chimney | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7880/47323554502_1489a7d50f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Savotta Chimney | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Hawu Roll Chimney from Finnish brand Savotta was amazing if you’re into hot camping in winter, a really great chimney that’s easy to set up and pack down, and also works with UL wood stoves. At 1 kg it might be heavier than the Titanium foil UL options, but the Hawu was so easy to use that I wouldn’t bother with any other chimney.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47323553152/in/dateposted/" title="Polyver Boots | IWA 2019 Impressions"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7903/47323553152_e32bea251f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Polyver Boots | IWA 2019 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And finally, as we’re still in the midst of winter here in Finland and Scandinavia, warm boots! Polyver Boots are Made in Sweden, not far away from <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/02/impressions-from-are.html">Åre</a>, and are fairly lightweight - around 700 g for a Size 42 Premium Low boot, but hold on before you start to write <em>“That’s not….”</em> - these are made for cold weather activities. Like, -25°C cold. Activities like ice fishing. And that’s where they will keep your toes toasty and dry, because waterproof they are too.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/47376403111/in/dateposted/" title="Härkilä"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7863/47376403111_2f6cd485b0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Härkilä" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="take-aways">Take Aways</h2>

<p>As I have said for years in my wrap-ups of the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/06/outdoorfn-2017-re-cap.html">OutDoor Friedrichshafen</a> and ISPO shows, these happenings are less about the gear for me and more about the people. And I met great people at the IWA, which care for nature and enjoy their time in the fjells and forests. I too really enjoyed my first IWA show and seeing all the <em>new gear</em> which I never see at one of the usual shows I attend, and best of all I had ZERO meetings which meant I was free to stroll around the fair and look at the stuff I am interested in. And so I came home with new impressions of a new fair and outdoor market, and got to know some interesting new equipment. Let me know in the comments on Facebook or via Twitter if you found this article interesting, and if you saw some interesting kit! I’ll leave you with some more impressions from the show and wish you a happy outdoor weekend!</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>It was a ridiculously busy show for me where I lost my DJI Ronin S Gimbal on the 2nd day (and got it back on the 3rd!), had 45 meetings and even saw a few pieces of exciting new gear. You can watch all my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqEBC4yj3FahCnppGZeGxAgFV0Oq07UnE">ISPO 2019 Videos on Youtube</a> in that handy Playlist, or watch my Recap/ Wrap-up underneath.</p>

<h2 id="exciting-new-gear">Exciting New Gear</h2>

<p><strong>THE Question</strong> at the show is usually “Have you seen something interesting?”. Usually I haven’t, but now, after having gone through my notes and having edited 36 Videos from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqEBC4yj3FahCnppGZeGxAgFV0Oq07UnE">ISPO 2019</a> I can say yeah, I have seen actually quite a few interesting things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Sustainability Trend Grows</li>
</ul>

<p>Before I became a photographer and writer I was an Environmental Management Consultant, so the topic of sustainability is something which is close to my heart. The Sustainability Trend has been growing each year, and after a few “Scandals” (Gore-Tex PFCs, Microfibre-shedding, treatment of animals and people who make our gear) it is great to see such a positive trend across the whole industry. Mountain Equipment takes in your old down jackets and sleeping bags and makes the Earthrise Jacket out of it, Pyua makes a Vegan Jacket, PrimaLoft developed an insulation material which decomposes, Sympatex rides ahead of the wave giving us ideas how to become a circular economy, Houdini already uses only recycled, recyclable, renewable and biodegradable fabrics in their new collection, and many more good things have happened in the last five years. All this is positive as it minimizes our industries’ and our own impact on the planet, ensuring that we keep the nature which we love so much in a good state.</p>

<ul>
  <li>More environmentally friendly synthetic fabrics</li>
</ul>

<p>I touched upon this above, but I really liked seeing big companies like PrimaLoft and Polartec addressing problems like microfibre shedding and making insulation decompose. Not everyone of us recycles their old outdoor garments and a fair share likely ends up in a landfill, so knowing that in the future these jackets will decompose is very positive. Likewise it is great to know that we can wash our Polartec Power Air jackets without the fear of contributing to the microfibre plastic pollution in our rivers, lakes and oceans. Add in that with a Sympatex or Nikwax garment you also keep PFcs out ofnature and you already today can dress up in a way that will not pollute the environment as badly as with other options.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Favourite Gear</li>
</ul>

<p>My favourite pieces of gear at the ISPO 2019 were the La Sportiva TX Top, the Houdini Power Air Houdi and some items from Spectra Fibre. I love my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/08/la-sportiva-tx2-review.html">La Sportiva TX2</a> and also the Crossover 2.0 GTX, so getting a combination of the two is amazing. As I wear a fleece Houdi all the time (like, right now while writing this article) I also really fancied the Houdini Power Air Houdi. Sadly I was too late in buying one, though hopefully they will get my size back in stock soon. I also stopped by at the booth of Spectra Fibre and it was exciting to see a new brand entering the industry with lightweight fabrics. These should work well for a variety of UL Outdoor gear, from backpacks to tents and bivy bags. Right now NW Alpine is one of the few companies which uses this material, but I’m certain more will follow!</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>

<p>It was obvious that there were less exhibitors and less visitors - the latter can be blamed in part on the weather, as Munich got hit by a proper load of snow this year on the first day of the show, and there were a lot of flights cancelled. But I think it also shows that these kind of trade fairs become less &amp; less a “Must-Be-There” event for many brands. Right now the ISPO is too late in the year for many retailers to see the new gear and make orders, and for us content creators both online and in print it’s quite hectic. I myself likely will not attend the new Summer ISPO show in June, because it’s a fairly expensive trip for me and if I can pick between having 12 hour days in Munich or chilling at the sea, painting Minis and playing board games I’m very much inclined to opt for the latter. I am, however, pondering visiting OR in Denver, though that also is connected to costs.
