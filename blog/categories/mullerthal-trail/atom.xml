    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are trails which are so full of spectacular natural scenery that the going is slow, because you stop all the time to take in these amazing views and observe the details. Route 2 of the Mullerthal Trail is such a trail, and I recommend that you take your time to enjoy this beautiful trail with all it‚Äôs wonderful viewpoints and inspiring rock formations.</p>

<h2 id="day-1-echternach---berdorf---heringer-millen">Day 1: Echternach - Berdorf - Heringer Millen</h2>

<p>After we hiked the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/11/mullerthal-trail-route-1.html">Mullerthal Trail Route 1</a> in completely terrible weather, on the morning of our third day the sun is shining, some clouds are slowly moving across the blue sky and it is a nice, warm 15¬∞C outside. It‚Äôs exactly the kind of weather you want when you hike <a href="https://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en/fiche/walking/stage-trail-mullerthal-trail-route-2">Route 2 of the Mullerthal Trail</a>. This is THE Route of the Mullerthal trail, with one scenic spot after the other. Which means, if you‚Äôre a photographer like me, the going will be slow üòÜ</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50837887466/in/dateposted/" title="Nuns"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50837887466_a0e229530f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Nuns" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We left Echternach on foot and soon passed the Trooskn√§ppchen view point, where we took a look back on the town which was out home the past three nights. Our luggage will be awaiting us at our next home for the night, so we can hike with light packs on the trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50837888796/in/photostream/" title="Trooskn√§ppchen Viewpoint"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50837888796_a79c790175_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Trooskn√§ppchen Viewpoint" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The trail goes along the left side of the valley, on the other side of it and the river is Germany, literally a stone throw away. The trail gives nice views on this valley, and the interaction of sunshine and clouds is pretty to observe. It does not take long and we are at the first scenic viewpoint of Route 2, the Wolfsschlucht, a steep canyon in which in past times wolves were hiding. It‚Äôs an impressive sight and we enjoy it a lot, but are surprised that after you have climbed the hundreds of stairs there‚Äôs a small cauldron from which stairs go further up on both sides. We climb both sets of stairs and are rewarded by beautiful views on the valley, with sunshine on our faces ‚òÄÔ∏è</p>

<p>The trail goes on past moss-covered rocks and green beech trees, stairs down, over little bridges, impressive rock walls. A pair of Dutch hikers pass us and ask if we know where the ‚ÄúLabyrinth‚Äù is - which is the next highlight, and which was just a few hundred meters ahead of us =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50837166068/in/photostream/" title="Labyrinth Entry"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50837166068_f4d571049a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Labyrinth Entry" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Labyrinth is described as <em>‚Äúa maze of rocks‚Äù</em> but the truth is that i‚Äôs less a maze than just a bunch of rocks where the trail goes through. It‚Äôs pretty, nevertheless. For these 3 km we already needed more than an hour, because of all the photo and video breaks. We arrive at the Perekop viewpoint, and decide to not go climb it - but I briefly let the drone go up and snap some photos from up in the air. The trail now leads away from the road and deeper into a forest canyon, where we go over half a dozen bridges which go over a small stream.</p>

<p>We climb some stairs and then stand in front of the mouth of the Huel Lee cave. This is a really popular spot but the moment we arrive the only other being there with us is a small stray cat, which miaus at us. Huel Lee is a cave where the local mill stones were ‚Äúbroken‚Äù from the rock, which generated this large cave. It‚Äôs a beautiful sight, and later on we learn that this is the only place where the rock quality was right for mill stones. I take a lot of photos while Martin talks to the cat, and as we leave we try to guide it with us back to Berdorf, but the wee cat decides to stay at the cave. We hope it will be well, and walk on.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs three hours after we have left Echternach that we arrive in Berdorf, which amounts to around 2 km of speed per hour. Yeps, that is REALLY slow.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50837160748/in/photostream/" title="Towards Berdorf"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50837160748_9a63541012_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Towards Berdorf" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In Berdorf we head into the <a href="https://en.trailinn.lu">Trail-Inn</a> Caf√© &amp; Restaurant. We order some coffee and some absolutely fantastic cake, but as I order the bill we‚Äôre a bit shocked to pay 20‚Ç¨ for two coffees and pieces of üç∞! As we leave Berdorf Martin and me are very much looking forward to the next section to the M√ºllerthal, there‚Äôs a lot of scenic spots along this section of the trail. Sadly we soon find the trail closed and a Detour sign - a flood destroyed the bridges here, and currently the final bridges and paths are put into place.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50837892771/in/photostream/" title="Um Leit Ung"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50837892771_ddafb377f6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Um Leit Ung" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This detour at least speeds us up considerably, and it‚Äôs also really pretty. We‚Äôre high above the normal trail and can get (careful) glimpses of the scenery down in the valley where Route 2 would take us along - we guess we‚Äôre between 30 and 50 m high up, so standing at the lip of rocks is scary. Not long and we‚Äôre at the Binzeltschl√´ff rock formation, which throwns above a road which is very silent. I fly my Drone again, and then we cross the road and Martin and me climb and squeeze through the Priedegtstull rocks. We laugh a lot here, it‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt usually get to do and if our kids would be here, they‚Äôd love it as much as we, we realize!</p>

<p>As we arrive at the top we realize that we definitely took the most adventurous detour through the rocks, as there also would have been a very easy path up here. But probably it was a lot less fun than our route! We take a look over the land from the viewpoint, and then dive into the forest.</p>

<p>The weather is perfect for a day of autumn hiking, with a light breeze and beautiful sunshine.</p>

<p>At one rock formation the sun reflects beautifully onto the rocks, painting them golden.</p>

<p>Almost at closing time we arrive at the <a href="https://www.mullerthal-millen.lu/en">Heringer Millen</a>, the tourist centre in the centre of the Mullerthal Trail network. Here you can <a href="https://www.mullerthal-millen.lu/en/touristcenter/bow">loan for free hiking gear</a>, from shoes and jackets to backpacks and even binoculars and GPS receivers. We however take a look at the beautiful old mill, and then hit the trail one last time today to hike on the C5 Trail towards the Camping place ‚Äú<a href="https://www.visitconsdorf.lu/en/camping-la-pinede/camping-la-pinede-2">La Pin√®de</a>‚Äù.</p>

<p>We stay tonight at a Mobilehome, which is nicer than it sounds. Our luggage awaits us as we arrive, and after a warm shower and putting all gadgets charging we head to eat at the <a href="https://www.brass.lu">Brasserie op Buergkapp</a>, which is a Minute away from where we sleep. It‚Äôs a nicely decorated place with really tasty food, and after a delicious starter, main and dessert we fall happily into our beds!</p>

<h2 id="day-2-consdorf-mllerthal---scheidgen---echternach">Day 2 Consdorf/ M√ºllerthal - Scheidgen - Echternach</h2>

<p>This was a long, sunny and enjoyable day of being outdoors in nature. After a good breakfast we hiked up to the Schiessent√ºmpel, the largest waterfall in Luxembourg and most photographed spot on the Mullerthal trail. We were lucky that there wasn‚Äôt a lot of people around this early in the morning, so after many photos and a drone flight (watch the Video!) we continued.</p>

<p>The trail leads up into the forest and we pass impressive rock formations like the Eulenburg, the Goldfralay with its little canyon and where a path leads up to the top of the cliff. It‚Äôs beautiful and we enjoy the scenery, hiking along these high rock walls.</p>

<p>We cross the street not far from the Consdorfer Millen, another mill, and are on a wide forest road while the sun climbs higher and sends its rays through the beech trees.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469289691/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Start of the final day"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469289691_d59eac82e9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Start of the final day" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then a narrow single trail path leads up into the forest, and not long and we are at the highlights of this section: Three very narrow canyons/ caves, two which also require a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/petzl-bindi-head-torch/?pid=10239">headlamp</a> to get through as they are completely dark. First is the Rittergang, a narrow canyon through which Martin and I squeeze, laughing about this kind of experience.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50468590723/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Squeeze in, Rittergang"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50468590723_f63c2abcbd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Squeeze in, Rittergang" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Next is the Deiwepetz canyon, which feels really long and the trail snakes through this even narrower canyon. It also gets pretty dark once you‚Äôre a few steps away from the entry, and I‚Äôm happy I have my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/petzl-iko-core-head-torch/?pid=10239">Petzl IKO Core</a> along.</p>

<p>We exit the Diewepetz, smiling. The sun shines, it gets warm, and we have one more canyon/ cave in front of us, the best one if we can believe our guide book! To get to the Kuelscheier cave you can hike the marked Circuit Trail, which also takes you up to a viewing point, or you can stay on the trail and get to the entry of the cave. We chose to do the circuit, and then head into the cave. It takes a turn and you‚Äôre in immediate darkness, and without some light you‚Äôre quickly falling or hurting yourself, as it is narrow, there are corners, stairs and narrow passages.</p>

<p>We exit the cave and continue on Route 2 now towards Hersberg, though shortly before the village we take a shortcut and head onwards to Scheidgen.</p>

<p>The warm weather and sunshine are very pleasant, we enjoy every moment out here in nature, being on this wonderful trail. And it does not get boring: It takes us along prehistoric grinding grooves and then leads up out of the forest and we cross some fields, before we are back in the forest. We cross small wooden bridges which allow us to keep the feet dry and take a look at the small M√©chelskierch cave which was home to a hermit in the 18. century.</p>

<p>In Scheidgen we hope into the <a href="https://lebonrepos.lu/restaurant/">Hotel Bon Repos &amp; Restaurant Le Grill</a> for lunch. Martin has a very tasty looking Hamburger while I eat a delicious salad, and we enjoy the view into the kitchen were the Chefs are preparing our food. Route 2 continues now for another 8 km till Echternach, and we hike down into a narrow, wooded valley.</p>

<p>We are passed by three Trailrunners, and now encounter also some more hikers, but not really a lot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the trail is showing itself from its most beautiful side. Light beech forests bath the trail in a warm, green-golden light, while the red-grey-green rock faces surprise us with different forms and make us smile.</p>

<p>After a few hours we arrive above Echternach and enjoy the view on the Abbey from up here in the forest. It‚Äôs funny how different it feels to come back here in warm weather and sunshine, and not soaking wet in the rain! We take a shortcut to the Campground, where we will be sleeping in a <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/sleeping-like-diogenes">Wooden Barrel</a>. We take a really nice warm shower and switch into some <a href="https://tidd.ly/3oCbf13">‚àû clean</a> and <a href="https://tidd.ly/2LeBvAU">‚àû fresh</a> <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/01/DUER-All-Weather-Denim-Jeans.html">clothes</a>, and head again to the Restaurant Aal Eechternoach for our celebratory Dinner!</p>

<h2 id="practicalities---where-to-stay-what-to-eat-and-how-to-get-around">Practicalities - Where to Stay, What to Eat and How to get Around</h2>

<p>We stayed at the start and the end of our trip in Echternach, which is a small town - the oldest in Luxembourg - which we really liked. We stayed the first three nights in the <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/tower-hamelmaous">medieval fortification tower H√§melmaous</a> which really was a beautiful experience. There‚Äôs a cozy kitchen at the ground floor, and then there‚Äôs four more floors in this round tower. It easily should sleep a family of four or more, and it‚Äôs also really close to the centre and the bus stop. At the end of our trip we slept in a <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/sleeping-like-diogenes">Wooden Barrel</a> on the Campground, which was a really cozy experience as well. I slept like a stone in my barrel, which is good for one to two persons and possibly a small child or two. The camping place is a wee bit outta town - some five to ten minutes of walking to the centre, but really close to the trail.</p>

<p>While hiking Route 2 you can stay either at ‚Äú<a href="https://www.visitconsdorf.lu/en/camping-la-pinede/camping-la-pinede-2">La Pin√®de Camping</a>‚Äù in Consdorf or at the <a href="https://lecigalon.lu">H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon</a> in Mullerthal, both are along Route 2 and pretty much in the middle of this trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50897605248/in/dateposted/" title="H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50897605248_ebd18e5549_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Both have options for eating out - at the Camping place in Consdorf we ate at the <a href="https://www.brass.lu">Brasserie op Buergkapp</a> which was tasty and plenty, while at the 4‚≠êÔ∏è Le Cigalon the food was good but it took ages and portions are small - so if you‚Äôre hungry after a long day of hiking, pick wisely!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/en/timetables-and-lines/bus/">Public bus transportation in Luxembourg</a> is free. Jump on a bus to get from one corner of the country to the other one (it‚Äôs a small country, so easy to do). The busses are plentiful and seem to stop even in the smallest villages, so hiking the Mullerthal Trail (or any other trail for that matter) in sections is easy to do.</p>

<h2 id="day-1-echternach---rosport---moersdorf">Day 1: Echternach - Rosport - Moersdorf</h2>

<p>Monday morning 7:00 o‚Äôclock, rain is hitting the windows of our <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/tower-hamelmaous">medieval fortification tower</a> in which were are sleeping while staying in Echternach, Luxembourg. Martin and me get up, happy about all this dry space and the warmth inside - we have experienced these kinds of mornings very differently over the past ten years, and while we were sceptical about <em>‚Äúnot sleeping in a tent‚Äù</em> we really didn‚Äôt mind not having to pack up a wet shelter and gear this morning. Instead we sat in our warm &amp; dry kitchen, ate breakfast and then set off hiking <a href="https://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en/fiche/walking/stage-trail-mullerthal-trail-route-1">Route 1 of the Mullerthal Trail</a>. While bells of the church ring we start the hike from the centre of Echternach, the oldest town in Luxembourg.</p>

<p>We walk through the pretty Park just behind the Abbey and then along the river S√ªre, which is also the Border to Germany on the other side. The light drizzle isn‚Äôt a problem, and after around 2 km we leave the river behind and climb up into the forest. Here the real Mullerthal Trail starts. Right away we see impressive rock formations tower above our right while we hike towards Rosport, the first village along the trail today. But till there it are still many kilometres, and the drizzle is becoming a more steady rain. It‚Äôs time for me to don my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/200-g-hardshell-montane-podium-pull-on-and-pants.html">Montane Podium Pull-on &amp; Pants</a>, a procedure which will be done several times per day on this hike, depending on the intensity of the rain.</p>

<p>Everything is wet. And green. A vibrant, wet green üå≥ Except the rocks - these tower in various shades of grey and brown along the trail, though truth be told - many are also covered in green moss. Once in a while traffic noise comes through the trees from the street far beneath us, but there‚Äôs other sounds closer by: The dripping of the rain on the beech leafs. Bird song accompanies us while we wander through the green jungle. Small streams gurgle through their beds when they run over rocks. And that soft, wet sound when you walk through mud with your <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/la-sportiva-crossover-2-dot-0-gtx.html">shoes</a>.</p>

<p>Never far away is also one of the Mullerthal Trailblazes, a red M on a white background. Overall signs really aren‚Äôt an issue on the trail - it‚Äôs a Premium Trail after all, which means there‚Äôs supposed to be a Trailblaze every 250 m. Also other signs are in no short abundance to be seen, from Signposts which tell you how far it is to the next place to trail markers for the dozens of other local trails which criss-cross the Mullerthal Trail. Sometimes we encountered signposts which had markings for seven different trails on them, from MTB Trails over border-crossing trails to local loop trails - there‚Äôs no shortage of outdoor possibilities in this corner of Luxembourg, be it hiking, trailrunning or Mountain Biking.</p>

<p>We continue in a good mood on this pretty trail, and even when it really starts to pour down we smile about the beauty which surrounds us. Mighty, green beech trees üå≥üå≥üå≥ keep most of the rain at bay and act like a giant umbrella. A soft brown blanket of old leafs makes for comfortable hiking. And small details make me smile.</p>

<p>We reach Rosport after a couple of hours and take a peak into the village if we spot an open Caf√©, but no, there‚Äôs nothing to be seen. A large truck picks up milk from a local farmer as we hike out of Rosport, and we hope to get a short, dry moment in the Tudor Museum, but also it is closed. Ah well, happily I have some <a href="http://trailbutter.eu/">Trail Butter</a> with me, which I eat on the go.</p>

<p>We leave the forest behind for a moment and right at that time the wind starts to accelerate and hit us with its might - and the rain. We pass the Pilgrimage Chapel at Girsterklaus, and shortly ponder if we should try our luck and see if it is open, or simply continue. The rain and wind make the decision to search for some shelter easy, and much to our surprise and luck the Chapel is open - as is the toilet building in front of it! We wash our hands and disinfect them and look for the door to gain entry to the small Chapel.</p>

<p>Again we are in luck and find the Chapel open, and unoccupied. Better even, there‚Äôs a heating system blowing warm, dry air into the chapel, and we immediately sit down in front of it. We hang up rain jackets to dry a bit, snack some nuts, drink water. I wander around the Chapel, admiring the beautiful wooden carvings - some which are almost 500 years old.</p>

<p>As we set off a while later, the rain has stopped, and we also get back into the forest. A younger forest.</p>

<p>A forest next to open fields. In one of these we see a young deer, who is mighty unimpressed by us sneaking up on him to snap a photo.</p>

<p>Close to Moersdorf we pick some absolutely amazing tasty apples, plums and pears from the trees next to the trail. These <em>‚ÄúStreuobstwiesen‚Äù</em>, or mixed orchard meadows, are often to be found along the trail, and in this Region of Luxembourg they use the fruits to make juice, cider and tasty food from them. And for us wet and hungry hikers, they are a very welcome snack!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs around 15:15 when we reach the signpost which says it‚Äôs 700 m to Moersdorf, the village where we planned to stop. <em>But it‚Äôs so early</em> we talk with Martin, <em>should we still continue to Mompach or Herborn? Then we have less to hike tomorrow.</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469620127/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Almost in Echternach!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469620127_34f4528c3e_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Almost in Echternach!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the end we decide to stick to the original plan, and hike down to Moersdorf. We locate the Busstop right away and don‚Äôt even have to wait long, before the Bus back to Echternach arrives. Public Transportation in Luxembourg is free, for everyone. As someone who does not own a car and who uses public transportation (or my bike!) all the time to get around, this is something I obviously absolutely LOVE. Free, punctual public transportation, across the whole country. Fantastic! It‚Äôs a 20 minute ride back to Echternach, and then we walk back to our medieval fortification tower for a warm shower and dry clothes. Obviously it also stopped to rain now‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="day-2-moersdorf---herborn---echternach">Day 2: Moersdorf - Herborn - Echternach</h2>

<p>Which is not something one could say of the next morning. The rain hammers against the windows of our tower, and after the breakfast we walk to the bus station to return to Moersdorf and continue our hike. Despite us both wearing our waterproofs we don‚Äôt look happy or in a high mood. But it doesn‚Äôt take long and we stand at the bus stop in Moersdorf, so all we can do is continue to hike back to the trail up in the forest. Which we do. And the forest doesn‚Äôt last long. In fact, a look on the map says we‚Äôll be hiking out in the open for a considerable amount of time today. On a sunny, clear day one is supposed to have great views across the land from up here, but all we see are fields, windmills and the rain which is blowing into our faces.</p>

<p>Until the village of Mompach we pretty much are exposed to the wind and rain, so when we enter the forest after Mompach, and then see two Pavilions, we are very grateful for the possibility to get out of the elements for a moment. Martin brews us a coffee on his <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/primus-lite-gas-stove/?pid=10238">‚àû Primus Lite+</a>, and after some more nuts, chocolate and a hot coffee we are in a better mood. Also, it seems we now will be hiking for a while in the forest, and not out in the open between fields.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not a very photogenic weather, so we are fast. Less than an half an hour later we are seeing Herborn already, the next village which we will pass through.</p>

<p>Again there is no Caf√© in sight, so we simply pass through the village in the rain. Happily, just before the forest, there is another open hut with a bench, where we have another short break out of the rain. It is now so wet that I decide to put my camera into my backpack and use my new <a href="https://amzn.to/35fK8B2">‚àû GoPro HERO 9</a> to take photos and videos instead. It‚Äôs not something I would usually do, as I see my equipment as a tool that needs to survive these harsh conditions, but I also didn‚Äôt want to risk it to get even more soaked on the 2nd day of the trip.</p>

<p>Happily at some point the rain decided to make a short break, and we also were again in a forest. A pretty, vibrant green beech forest.</p>

<p>These last few kilometres of Route 1 were again enjoyable. We were in a good mood, here, in this üå≥ green forest. We made jokes. Laughed. Had another break, in another hut.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469438292/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Bench and Hut and Bin"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469438292_62bee33dc0_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Bench and Hut and Bin" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then we saw Echternach.</p>

<p>The forest road became a pretty path.</p>

<p>Slippery, yes. But better than an asphalt road between open fields.</p>

<p>And then we were back in Echternach, at the lake. Together with the rain.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50468586188/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Swan"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50468586188_a73ba9cfb9_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Swan" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Our conclusion of Route 1</strong> is that the first section from Echternach to Moersdorf via Rosport is a beautiful section (according to my Suunto Spartan Ultra GPS it were 20 km) through beautiful forests and along intriguing rock formations. The Chapel in Girsterklaus is pretty and does make for a good break spot, the apple, pear and plum trees which occasionally are next to the trail are in the autumn full of tasty fruits, and there‚Äôs some really scenic trail section.</p>

<p><em>Now for the section from Moersdorf to Herborn and back to Echternach‚Ä¶</em> I would not hike it if you‚Äôre not a completionist who is hunting for the title of <em>‚ÄúI hiked the complete Mullerthal Trail‚Äù</em>. Maybe in sunny and warm weather the asphalt &amp; forest roads next to fields are enjoyable, but in the rain they were not. Martin and I both agreed that it would have made more sense to completely skip the 2nd part of Route 1 and hike on Route 2, which is the absolute highlight route of the Mullerthal Route with an amazing scenery spot every kilometre.</p>

<p>We were lucky that there were huts on the second day in which we could get a small break from the rain and wind, but this section was such a stark contrast to the beautiful forest part on Day 1 that we felt a bit let down. But then we had another four amazing hiking days on the Mullerthal Trail, so don‚Äôt worry üòÅ! Trip Reports from Route 2 and 3 will follow in short order.</p>

<h2 id="practicalities---where-to-stay-what-to-eat-and-how-to-get-around">Practicalities - Where to Stay, What to Eat and How to get Around</h2>

<p>We stayed at the start and the end of our trip in Echternach, which is a small town - the oldest in Luxembourg - which we really liked. We stayed the first three nights in the <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/tower-hamelmaous">medieval fortification tower H√§melmaous</a> which really was a beautiful experience. There‚Äôs a cozy kitchen at the ground floor, and then there‚Äôs four more floors in this round tower. It easily should sleep a family of four or more, and it‚Äôs also really close to the centre and the bus stop. At the end of our trip we slept in a <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/sleeping-like-diogenes">Wooden Barrel</a> on the Campground, which was a really cozy experience as well. I slept like a stone in my barrel, which is good for one to two persons and possibly a small child or two. The camping place is a wee bit outta town - some five to ten minutes of walking to the centre, but really close to the trail.</p>

<p>We ate every evening in the <a href="https://aaleechternoach.lu/">Restaurant Aal Eechternoach</a>, which we picked because of the positive reviews it had on Google Maps - and as we went there every evening you probably understand that they also have good food =) They use a lot of local ingredients and also serve local beverages - the local apple juice was delicious, as were all their Vegan offerings. Martin ate the best Cordon Bleu of his life here, and it did look really very good indeed. There‚Äôs a small supermarket not far from the tower, and a few smaller ones on the main shopping street, where there‚Äôs also a nice wee bakery which had good baked goods.</p>

<p>As I wrote above: <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/en/timetables-and-lines/bus/">Public bus transportation in Luxembourg</a> is free. Jump on a bus to get from one corner of the country to the other one (it‚Äôs a small country, so easy to do). The busses are plentiful and seem to stop even in the smallest villages, so hiking the Mullerthal Trail (or any other trail for that matter) in sections is easy to do.</p>
