<p>I have followed Jotaro’s development of the LOCUS GEAR Djedi DCF-eVent Dome Tent over the last four years, being very interested in this amazing little tent. I find free-standing dome tents a great and useful design, and the lighter the package the better. During the past winter Jotaro hinted that the tent might soon be ready for production - and that moment has now arrived!</p>

<p>Watch the Video to get some insights on how the Djedi became a reality.</p>

<p>Quite a great story, and also interesting to see a little bit into the LOCUS GEAR workshop! I caught up with Jotaro and here’s a wee background on the design and production process:</p>

<p>“Most people think it’s a Star Wars thing,” says Jotaro, “But originally ‘Djedi’ is an Egyptian God’s name. ‘Djedi’ starts with the letter D, and D is also the shape of the dome.” Jotaro needed almost four years to be happy with what he considered the ultimate dome tent: The strong, lightweight, waterproof and breathable Djedi Dome – the first Dome tent made with Dyneema® Composite Fabric with eVent. This fabric combines the advantages of two very popular fabrics in the ultralight niche - Dyneema Composite Fabric and eVent. The result is a lightweight fabric which is waterproof and exceptionally breathable.</p>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/22WjTt" title="LOCUS GEAR Djedi DCF-eVent Dome Tent"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/900/39439979840_2dd51bf08c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="LOCUS GEAR Djedi DCF-eVent Dome Tent" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>“I made eight different prototypes using different fabrics but was never satisfied,” says Jotaro. “Condensation is a major problem for anyone who camps. And if your inside walls and then possibly your down sleeping bag and other gear gets wet, the situation can even become life threatening at worst or less fun at best. So, for a dome tent it goes beyond being strong and extremely light. Breathability is the true ‘dream’ property.”</p>

<p>As Jotaro has being producing functional &amp; beautiful Dyneema Composite Fabric shelters for many years, it was a logical move to also use this fabric for the Djedi. Dyneema is the world’s strongest, lightest fiber that is fifteen times stronger than steel but floats on water. It has been used since many years by most key players in the ultralight outdoor industry to create lighter and more functional gear while driving innovation and performance levels of shelters and tents – to make them both stronger for protection and lighter for packing. The new breathability factor of the DCF-eVent fabric can now inspire the tent industry to yet newer heights.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You sometimes feel you’d need a little extra space on your hiking and backpacking trips, but don’t want a bigger backpack? Then a Shoulder or Multi-use Pack could be the solution, allowing you to carry for example your camera, map and compass close by in a protected manner. What else they are good for and which Shoulder and Multi-use Packs I use, you read in this article.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21959768512/in/dateposted/" title="Shoulder &amp; Multi-Packs for hiking &amp; backpacking"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/660/21959768512_6a29b549d7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Shoulder &amp; Multi-Packs for hiking &amp; backpacking" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I have been using shoulder packs since over four years. I found them a great multi-use item, allowing me to carry my essentials - compass, map, fire-starters, knife, valuables and camera - close by, also if I enter a Café or shop along the trail, while my backpack waits outside. They also are off the trail in city-use a great choice, as I find big messenger bags often just too big for the few items I carry. The packs I use also are pretty water-resistant, which is great for my camera when it is too rainy to be carried on my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/01/peak-design-capture-pro-camera-clip.html">Peak Design Capture Pro Clip</a>. If you sometimes find that you could do with a bit more space in your pack to carry some gear, consider one of these three shoulder bags instead of a bigger backpack - they are cheaper and can be used in more ways, and make a great addition to your existing rucksack.</p>

<h2 id="wanderlust-equipment-khampa-la-pack">Wanderlust Equipment Khampa La Pack</h2>

<p>I bought the Khampa La Pack at the beginning of 2015 and have been using it on all my hikes abroad and in Finland since. It’s a great little shoulder pack that carries snacks, a camera, map and compass without problems, and the Dyneema X Gridstop material is pretty water-resistant and in combination with the waterproof zipper the content can survive light downpours without problems. I usually carry the Khampa La Pack so that it sits on the right side of my chest where I have quick access to the content. The shape reminds me of the bumbags which were mighty trendy in the 80s. It’s a good size and I often also take it along on trips to town when I just want to carry the camera. The cushioned shoulder strap is completely removable via two buckles and so you could attach the Khampa La to compatible buckles on a backpack. The cushioned bit of the shoulder is pretty small and you need to pay attention when you put the Khampa La on, otherwise the narrow cord might cut uncomfortably into your shoulder. A great looking and durable shoulder bag that will see many more years of use.</p>

<h2 id="zpacks-multi-pack">ZPacks Multi-Pack</h2>

<p>I bought a ZPacks Multi-Pack probably around four years ago, just a while after they came out. It has seen a lot of use on hikes around the globe, from the original <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/09/ultralight-summit-daytrippin.html">UL Summit</a> to the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a>. It’s made from the same Hybrid Cuben Fiber material as <a href="http://bit.ly/1QUtOqg">Hyperlite Mountain Gear backpacks</a>, which is highly waterproof and very abrasion-resistant. What’s special about it are the six attachment points and the straps which come with it, these allow you to wear the Multi-Pack in many, many different ways: As a shoulder bag, attached to your backpack as a chest pack, as a bumbag or clip it to your backpack as a lid. I have used it mostly as a chest pack, especially when I wasn’t using the afore-mentioned Peak Designs Capture PRO Clip to carry my camera yet. The Multi-Pack is super big and has the largest volume of these three, and a large camera like the <a href="http://amzn.to/1j9ky7n">Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ1000</a> fits into the pack without problem, with room to spare for additional batteries, snacks, Passport and iPhone. Because of the waterproof construction downpours should be no problem, though I have sometimes got a bit moisture inside of it. The straps make it versatile in use, but if you own a couple of backpacks it can happen that while you take the Multi-Pack the straps might still be connected to another pack - has happened a few times to me. The straps are very thin and not very comfortable to carry for a long time on your shoulder, especially if the content is not ultralight. But other than that this is a great multi-use item which has served me well for many years.</p>

<h2 id="locus-gear-nanos">Locus Gear Nanos</h2>

<p>The Nanos is my city and Ultralight Travel bag of choice. The reason is simple: It can carry a magazine or book without problems. Also a notebook and shades find a dedicated place in this light shoulder bag, which in my case is made of Spinnaker. Also the Nanos is waterproof - however, because of the large opening on top which only closes via a Velcro strap rain could easily get in from the top. The shoulder strap is wide and comfortable throughout the day, but at least when cycling has a tendency to let the bag slip, with the result being that it is hanging down to my front. I have used it a couple of times for hiking but didn’t find it as good for that as the other two above because these can be worn closer to the chest, which I find on the trail more comfortable. But the Nanos is ideal for urban use, carrying a magazine or iPad, snacks and your essentials in style without weighing you down. <em>Attention: I have a earlier version of the Nanos, the current design is a bit different.</em></p>

<p>Weight: <strong>37 g</strong> Price: <strong>4.200円 (~ 31€)</strong> Available at <a href="http://locusgear.com/products-2/accessories/nanos?lang=en">Locus Gear</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pyramid shelters are the third wonder of the ultralight backpacking world. Fast to pitch, spacious, and very windproof these are versatile shelters which work in a multitude of locations and seasons. If you’re a true minimalist then a shelter like the <a href="http://locusgear.com/products/shelter/khufu-sil">LOCUS GEAR Khufu Sil</a> might be all that you ever need.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7807717428/" title="Wo ein Wille ist... by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8438/7807717428_1981b650ea_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Wo ein Wille ist..." /></a></p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>
<p>I have been using the <a href="http://locusgear.com/products/shelter/khufu-sil">LOCUS GEAR Khufu</a> in Silnylon for over one and half years, in winter, spring, summer, autumn and winter again. There were starry nights, windy nights, snowy nights, rainy nights and sunny mornings spent in this shelter, on overnighters, week long trips and weekenders.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6962619602/" title="LOCUS GEAR by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7140/6962619602_71de147a94_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="LOCUS GEAR" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>
<p>A shelters function is to protect you from the weather, this often means rain, snow and wind. It gives you a place to get under if there’s no starry night, and to hold out during crap weather. You also might want to cook under it, and generally spend time in it if the weather just isn’t great.</p>

<p>Depending on your priorities - do you walk a lot and only pitch your shelter once it’s time to hit the hay or do you spend a lot of time at camp - you will have different expectations from your shelter. The person who hikes for 12 hours each day likely is looking for a lightweight, compact shelter which still gives her good protection during a thunderstorm at night, while the camper might prefer a very spacious shelter. I think the Khufu fits both groups very well, though the hiker probably will value the shelter more because of its light weight and stormproofness.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7783259222/" title="Open Doors by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8307/7783259222_fbc46ab400_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Open Doors" /></a></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>It packs in a small package and hence fits well even in smaller volume backpacks. Those who have mesh pockets on their backpacks will find that it fits in a side pocket without problem, and takes also little space in the front pouch.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8511326150/" title="Size by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8100/8511326150_0821a05e75_b.jpg" width="1024" height="739" alt="Size" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8510214893/" title="Packed by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8247/8510214893_51788ff235_b.jpg" width="680" height="1024" alt="Packed" /></a></p>

<p>The top has a mesh air vent, and while it works good I think it would benefit from being bigger. In conditions where there is a lot of condensation you will get condensation either way, but if there would be only a bigger air vent that might make the different between a wet inner or a dry inner (provided there’s a good breeze). The air vent has a wire in it so that it stays open, and while it can not be closed you can pull it close to the door with a guyline &amp; line-lock to hinder spindrift snow come inside. You can circumvent the condensation by pitching one or two sides a bit higher to get more airflow, this would help in situations where this only little condensation, though.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8511330404/" title="Condensation by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8512/8511330404_193824f569_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Condensation" /></a></p>

<p>The doors can both be opened and rolled to the side, giving you fine views from under a roof. Of course you also can only open one door - roll them up and use the toggle and loop to keep it out of the way.</p>

<p>The reflective guylines used are light, thin, and work very well. They could be a bit longer - especially if you use the shelter in winter but I have coped with the stock ones until now. The line locks are the small ones, and make it easy &amp; convenient to re-adjust the tension of the shelter, especially in winter.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6812306790/" title="LOCUS GEAR Khufu Sil by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7069/6812306790_d0e579808e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="LOCUS GEAR Khufu Sil" /></a></p>

<p>Size matters in inclement conditions. The Khufu is 130 cm high (if pitched with one pole; I have used them with my <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/black-diamond-ultra-distance-trekkingstoecke-bf/">Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Pole Trekking Poles</a> in 130 cm length), 160 cm wide and 265 cm long. The usable length I’d put around 200 cm and 140 to 160 cm in width. I’m 175 cm tall and for me there’s plenty of space for sleeping and gear in the shelter, but people who are 195 cm and taller might find that they touch the shelter with their feet or head when sleeping. There’s plenty of usable space to store gear along the perimeter of the shelter, and two short persons should fit in the Khufu without problem, even without using the <a href="http://locusgear.com/products/accessories/dpte">DPTE</a>, the Dual Pole Tip Extender which allows you to pitch the shelter with two trekking poles. The long side goes very steep upwards so the width inside is almost all completely usable, whereas the narrow ends have a more gradual angle and hence there is less usable space inside along them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8510210313/" title="Khufu Sil by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8365/8510210313_ac59202087_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Khufu Sil" /></a></p>

<p>I usually use the Dual Pole Tip Extender in winter, as that way I get more interior space and I imagine also in heavy snowfall the snow might glide down the side more easier (the latter I haven’t been able to confirm yet). It allows you to pitch the shelter in an A-Frame instead of one pole in the middle, so if you’re with two people and want to be close to each other this is an essential tool. It’s 112 g heavy and consists of two aluminium pipes which are connected via a piece of fabric, and for the handles you have two baskets made of fabric which wrap around the handles and connect via a string, that way you get the right distance for the poles for the A-Frame. The Khufu has velcro straps on the inside which allow you to attach the shelter to the poles. It takes a bit more work to get a good pitch when using it, but it’s vert stable in the wind then.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8511315596/" title="DCTP by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8085/8511315596_c2dc7db467_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="DCTP" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8510237709/" title="DCTP in the top by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8510237709_1905ea90e9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="DCTP in the top" /></a></p>

<p>The top of the shelter, as well as the corner and mid tie-out points, have Dyneema reinforcements to not put too much stress on the silnylon. At the mid tie-out points there are elastic loops to connect extra guylines to.</p>

<p>The beauty of the Khufu is that it sheds wind from all directions very well, of course it is best if you pitch the narrow side into the wind, but I have spent nights in the Khufu where the long side was in the wind, and there were no problems either.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>
<p>The Pyramid design has been around a bit. Black Diamond, GoLite, Oware, and Mountain Laurel Designs have been making Pyramid shelters for a number of years, and before them probably also others.</p>

<p>What makes the LOCUS GEAR Khufu special is that you can get it in a number of materials: <a href="http://locusgear.com/products/shelter/khufu-sil">Silnylon</a>, highly breathable <a href="http://locusgear.com/products/shelter/khufu-event_ii">eVent II</a>, ultralight <a href="http://locusgear.com/products/shelter/khufu-cuben">cuben</a>, <a href="http://locusgear.com/products/shelter/khufu-tyvek">tyvek</a> and also a <a href="http://locusgear.com/products/shelter/mesh-shelter">mesh inner</a> is available. This allows you to pick the one Khufu (or two) you need for your conditions, which is a smart move, in my opinion. Add in the DPTE and you really can make this the one shelter to suit every need you might have.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>
<p>The workmanship of the Khufu is superb. There’s something about Japanese craftsmanship that just makes me awe. Like a well made  刀 or katana the gear I have seen from Jotaro is of the highest quality, and attention is paid to every detail. Be it the materials, seams, guylines and line-locks, everything that goes into making this shelter is like a high quality, fresh ingredient, used by a Michelin Star Chef to create a perfect meal - or in this case, a superb shelter.</p>

<p>Even after a year of use in each season the shelter shows no signs of durability issues. The silnylon still is waterproof and the zipper runs as smooth as on the first day. No thread has come lose either, and overall I have been very happy about the durability of this shelter.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>
<p>My Silnylon Khufu weighs 399 gram including guylines. The stuff sack adds another 12 g. The new Khufus (from 2012 onwards, Aspen Gold &amp; Alpine Green) are a bit heavier, about 60 g, as LOCUS GEAR is using a new Silynlon which is even higher quality than the one in mine.</p>

<p>Products that occupy the same niche are the Mountain Laurel Designs DuoMid (481 g), Black Diamond Mega Light (1050 gram, 4 Persons), Black Diamond Beta Light Tent (535 g, 2 Persons), Oware Alphamid (524 g), so just going by the listed weights it seems the Khufu Sil is the lightest Pyramid Shelter available at the moment (in Silnylon).</p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>
<p>LOCUS GEAR pyramid shelters like the Khufu and Khafra are perfectly planned to use the whole fabric in the maximum width so that there are as little leftovers as possible. Even if there are remnants these will be used for accessories, e.g. stakes sacks and stuff sacks.</p>

<p><em>More in the future.</em></p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>
<p>The MLD DuoMid &amp; Oware Alphamid are a rather similar design, then there’s the Black Diamond Beta Light Tent, and the GoLite Shangri-La who all are Pyramid-shaped to some extent. There’s probably more, but I’m not aware of them - if you know others, let me know in the comments.</p>

<h2 id="what-others-say">What Others Say</h2>
<p><a href="http://ryanjordan.com/">Ryan Jordan</a> likes his cuben Khufu. <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/">Benjamin</a> has taken his Khufu Sil out many times in Germany and Switzerland, and <a href="http://infiniteoutdoors.blogspot.fi/">Marius</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.barefootjake.com/">Jake</a> just got one each in Aspen Yellow.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>
<p>I like the LOCUS GEAR Khufu so much that I decided to get a second one in eVent II (which will be reviewed in due time). If I go out on a pleasure trip where research and testing gear isn’t a priority, I grab the Khufu Sil and know that I have a shelter with me that can withstand anything I could encounter - strong winds, snow, rain or a mix thereof. If I want privacy on a camping place I close the doors and have ample space inside. If I want views I open both doors but still am protected from wind and weather. I can sit straight up in it and can get easily dressed/ undressed.</p>

<p>It is a superb shelter which I can recommend to anyone who wants a lightweight shelter which works in all seasons and environments. It is versatile, comes in great colours (I love that green!) and is extremely well made.</p>

<p><em>Two things that could be improved:</em><br />
- Longer standard guylines - even 10 cm more would do it.<br />
- Attachment loops/ tie-out points inside at the head/ food end for easier bivy guyline attachment.</p>

<p>These are personal things I’d like improved, and at least #1 I could easily fix myself (and likely will at some point).</p>
