    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A month ago my son and me went on a father-son winter trip: XC skiing, Ice-fishing and of course downhill skiing was our program for a week, in which we had a lot of fun and got to know each other better.</p>

<p>Travelling with kids, it can be a hassle. We found the best way to do it for us is to do it in sections with longer breaks in the middle, plenty of comics to read and some candy &amp; snacks. With that strategy the 9-ish hour trip from Vaasa to Ruka went by without problems, and my 8-year old son and me arrived nice and punctual with the Skibus in the village of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/04/spring-skiing-in-ruka.html">Ruka</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49546855563/in/dateposted-public/" title="On the road"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49546855563_14c0513681_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="On the road" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>From the bus stop it was a one minute walk to our accommodation, the Ski-Inn right in the middle of Ruka Village. My skis were in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/04/packing-for-ski-touring.html">Douchebag</a> and our clothes in the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/arcteryx-v110-rolling-duffel-luggage/?pid=10239">Arc’teryx V110 Rolling Duffle</a> which made it easy for me to pull all our stuff while my son only had to carry his own backpack. Once we checked in to our room - a very nice apartment with our own kitchen, Sauna and two bed rooms - we went for a walk to the supermarket in the village to get some Müsli and dinner, and as we were sitting for 9 hours on our butts it also was good to go for a walk in the village, and explore more of Ruka, before going to our Sauna and hitting the hay - because we had some full, exciting days ahead for us =)</p>

<h2 id="skiing">Skiing</h2>

<p><strong>Or: Getting ready for off-piste adventures</strong></p>

<p>Day 1 in Ruka, and our first stop after breakfast is the <a href="https://ski.ruka.fi/en/pisterental">Piste Rental Shop</a> in the Village to pick up my son’s skis and our ski passes. Getting the gear is a fast affair and 10 Minutes later we’re outside again, sitting in the Gondola to Ruka Valley my son has a refresher session with <a href="https://new.ruka.fi/en/ski-school">Ruka Ski School</a>. We start on the brand-new Rosa &amp; Rudolf Slopes, where five belt lifts bring ski and snowboard beginners to the top of the fenced-in slope. After two runs the ski school teacher decides we will go to the real slopes right away as the young student is good enough.</p>

<p>After an hour on the slopes and having skied down some red and blue slopes it’s time to explore the ski resort on our own, with the tips and advice from our great ski school teacher in mind. The one thing I love about Ruka Ski Resort is how easy it is to explore the different sides and hills of the area, and I take my son towards Maasto, the <em>“Off-the-beaten-track”</em> slopes in the east of the area. There’s substantially fewer people here skiing - and in the middle of January there’s already <em>REALLY</em> few people here! But we like it more silent, and the landscape with the snow-covered trees is here especially pretty, and there’s no-one waiting at the T-lift at the bottom of the slope either.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49546859283/in/dateposted-public/" title="hanging"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49546859283_367ef9e9ce_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="hanging" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And that’s how we spent several hours of the week each day. My son is a careful skier, and once we identified his favourite runs we would hit these first thing every day and then ski from left to right and back across the whole resort. We had some short breaks at the various huts or the Cafés along the slope, refilling energy levels with a hot chocolate and some Pulla, before it was back to the chair or T-Bar lifts and enjoy the finely prepared slopes anew.</p>

<p>Night skiing is a thing when the sun goes up at 10:30 am and sets at 2:00 pm, and thanks to very well illuminated slopes it’s not a problem at all to ski in darkness. This is especially useful when a parent still has energy to go skiing while a child would rather read comics at home 😉</p>

<p>Overall I really had a great time skiing with my son at Ruka Ski Resort. I love the variety of runs and how easy it is to hit some off-piste terrain between the slopes. There are also enough easy routes and slopes which see less people, which makes it ideal if you’re there with kids.</p>

<h2 id="ice-fishing">Ice-fishing</h2>

<p><strong>Or: Learning to wait for the bait</strong></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547592972/in/dateposted-public/" title="Lake"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547592972_3ce980d304_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lake" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Besides daily skiing in the Ski resort we also had some other activities while we were in Ruka. One which my son and me enjoyed a lot was the visit to the <a href="https://www.palosaarenporotila.fi/en/">Reindeer and Fishing Farm Palosaari</a> closer to Kuusamo. We started our visit off with a ride on the reindeer sled, which was a lot of fun and my son got his <strong>Reindeer Driving License</strong> that day 😊</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547366726/in/dateposted-public/" title="On the sled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547366726_f1e976b1f4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="On the sled" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We continued down to the lake. This was an oasis of peace for me - I’m very sensitive to noise, and over here there was no disturbing noise as I hear it every day in the city. Out here on this calm lake there was only the wind which moved the snow-covered branches, and the occasional chirping of some Siberian Jays. Other than that there was only silence. Beautiful, natural silence.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547593567/in/dateposted-public/" title="Ice fishing"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547593567_93955f3311_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ice fishing" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Owner Mika showed us how to drill holes into the ice, clean the hole from slushy ice water, and then how to move our rods to entice the trout and bass in the lake to <em>go on the hook</em>. We discussed strategies - does it make sense to move every five minutes if you don’t have a contact or should you remain stationary for hours to wait till the fish come and visit you? The answer is, it depends. On the lake, you, the weather and temperature and the fish in the lake.</p>

<p>We adopted a strategy of moving every 20 to 30 minutes, but even after a few times of drilling new holes and trying our best to present the bait in the most tasty fashion, no fish was around to fall for our tasty maggots and shiny baits. Ah well, a good thing that Mika had a back-up plan 😉 After a few hours out on the lake we walked up to the lean-to shelter, where a fire was already burning and hot juice &amp; coffee as well as tasty, home-made treats were served. We sat around the fire, discussed developments in the region and how they affect reindeer farmers and tourism in the area, and again I was left wondering while our politicans make decisions which no one I spoke to wants, and which only benefit large multi-national companies, to the detriment of the local environment and people. I finished up my second cup of tasty coffee and then we walked back to the lake, with new motivation and hope to catch one of these elusive inhabitants of the lake.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547367571/in/dateposted-public/" title="Brake while Ice fishing"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547367571_0a8e7abeb7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Brake while Ice fishing" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Alas, also after another hour on the lake, moving and drilling several new holes into the ice, we had to admit that the fish were too smart for us (or simply not hungry 😃), as we didn’t catch a single one of them. However, my son, Anna-Riitta, Mika and me, we had a great time here on the silent lake, and so we were not at all disappointed when we packed up our fishing gear and headed back to the farm. Mika handed us our <a href="https://www.palosaarenporotila.fi/en/">Reindeer and Fishing Farm Palosaari</a> Reindeer Driving license, which now allows us to manoeuvre sleds pulled by Rudolf and his siblings, and then we made us on the way back to Ruka and hit the slopes for some afternoon skiing!</p>

<h2 id="ice-climbing">Ice climbing</h2>

<p><strong>Or: Why am I still this good?</strong></p>

<p>The long-time reader knows <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/ice-climbing-in-korouoma.html">I love ice climbing</a> but also is likely aware that I haven’t climbed much ice in recent years. The winters have been bad, I have discovered skitouring as a beautiful way to explore the outdoors in winter, and I also don’t have a lot of friends that climb ice anymore.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49546854623/in/dateposted-public/" title="Gondel Cabins"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49546854623_bfd21b191e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Gondel Cabins" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That all would change during our visit to Ruka, and to top things off my 8-year old son would also get to climb his first ice route! <a href="https://www.outdoorpassion.fi/en/">Outdoor Passion Finland</a>, which is run by Jussi and his wife Lotta, took us under their wings and both thought my son and rekindled my love for ice climbing. Lotta and Jussi are perfect with kids, and after we were kitted out with crampons, gaiters, harness, helmets and ice tools we hiked like John Wayne to the ice fall, which is in the middle of the ski resort and a spectacular 35 m high. But before we were allowed to climb, Jussi gave us a introduction to climbing on ice, from foot and tool placement to how to get back down.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49546862903/in/dateposted-public/" title="Learning to ice climb"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49546862903_780c26c9b9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Learning to ice climb" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My son was very brave and climbed his route really well, and I am very proud of him that he climbed this ice fall! I too did some ice climbing, and surprised myself quite a bit as I seemed to be able to climb the different routes without any issues. I haven’t climbed ice (or rock, or plastic 😟) in the past two years, so it was a bit of a shock that even on the steep route I had no problem with placing tools and crampons, climbing onto smaller ledges, and that there were also no screaming barfies. I even raced up the simplest route and got to the anchor in under two minutes…</p>

<p>After all the climbing Lotta and Jussi took us to explore the Ground-Ferrata which they had built in the nearby forest. It’s basically a track which takes you through the snow-covered forest, through the snow-covered spruce trees 🌲 ❤️ and back to the ice wall. It was simple, but very beautiful and a great experience to go through the snow tunnel under the tree and climb back out!</p>

<h2 id="xc-skiing">XC Skiing</h2>

<p><strong>Or: There and Back again</strong></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547369956/in/dateposted-public/" title="XC skiing"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547369956_11f93fc12d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="XC skiing" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On our last full day in Ruka we decided to go XC skiing. My son usually goes XC skiing at school, but due to climate change and the ongoing disastrous winter winter we have in Vaasa he hasn’t been even once skiing with school, and as it is also an activity I enjoy a lot I felt it would be a good thing to do. What I didn’t account for was the strong, cold wind which was blowing across Lapland that morning, and which would bring a lot more snow over the following days to the North of the country…</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547596542/in/dateposted-public/" title="XC skiing 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547596542_608363c97a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="XC skiing 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547585032/in/dateposted-public/" title="XC skiing 3"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547585032_bedcf5c170_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="XC skiing 3" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We started again at the <a href="https://ski.ruka.fi/en/pisterental">Piste Rental Shop</a> where we loaned our XC skiing gear, and then we took the Gondola to Ruka Valley from where we would ski around 3,5 km to a Café. So far the plan. The reality was that the weather really wasn’t very favourable, as we were skiing into the wind and snow, which my son didn’t enjoy particularly much. However, with the promise of a hot chocolate and pancakes or waffles we made it in the end to the small, cozy Café, where we enjoyed our break.</p>

<p>The way back, as these things usually go, was easier. With the wind in our back, and some tasty treats in our bellies, as well as some gentle, fun downhills, we were back at the Gondola Station in Ruka Valley in some 30 minutes! We were also really lucky as just as we arrived a Gondola came in, and so we were sitting down in one of the cabins to get back to Ruka Village.</p>

<h2 id="polar-night-light-festival">Polar Night Light Festival</h2>

<p><strong>Or: Did you see that?!</strong></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49412716163/in/dateposted-public/" title="Ruka Slopes during the Polar Night Light Festival"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49412716163_a1d440894c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ruka Slopes during the Polar Night Light Festival" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <a href="http://lightfestival.fi">Polar Night Light Festival</a> is an annual Festival which transforms the slopes of Ruka into a colourful wonderland, with amazing light installations all across the village and slopes. It’s always in January as then it is still really dark up North, and definitely worth a visit. As a photographer I absolutely loved to see this Festival, and I highly recommend you take a good Tripod, footwear with good grip and warm clothes along if you plan to photograph them, as it does get cold on the slopes at night. Also take care of the Pistenbullies and snowmobiles which might ride on the slopes at night and prepare everything for skiers and snowboarders! Of course you also can just enjoy the installations when you go skiing after the sun set at 2:00 pm 😆</p>

<h2 id="being-a-good-parent">Being a good parent</h2>

<p><strong>Or: Learning to put others first</strong></p>

<p>My son and me, we can be like water &amp; fire, OR then we can be best friends. When it is just the two of us, and he gets all my attention, things definitely are a lot easier and we get along really well. I also am more relaxed, and try to remember to put his wants &amp; needs before mine. For example, if he gets tired or has no motivation to hit the slopes after a while, I usually have a hard time to accept that, but the smart, emphatic side of my brain then tells me to just let him go back to the apartment and chill &amp; read comics, while I continue to ski. That way be both are happy, and skiing (or other activities) don’t get a bad connotation for him, which means in the long-run he’s more likely to enjoy these activities as much as me. After all, we were here to have a good time together, and when one is not enjoying something it’s not smart to force him to do it. With high costs for renting gear and lift passes it’s easy to forget these things, but in the long-term I feel it’s better for all involved, and it definitely worked well for us on this and past trips.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-eat--where-to-stay">What to Eat &amp; Where to Stay</h2>

<p>We stayed at the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/rukasuites">Ski Inn</a> in the centre of Ruka Village, and had a super-nice apartment. We enjoyed the Sauna every evening together, and the small kitchen was all I needed to cook some simple meals for us two. The Supermarket was a stone-throw away, as were a handful of restaurants and Cafés. There are plenty more <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/where-to-stay">places to stay in Ruka</a> for any budget, and especially the brand-new <a href="https://www.ski-inn.fi/en/majoitus/ruka/hotel-rukavalley">Ruka Valley</a> Hotel &amp; Apartments look like a great choice for families as the Kids Slope are in front of the building!</p>

<p>We ate in a variety of places during our stay, from the new <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/campkitchen">CAMP Kitchen</a> which serves a super-tasty Vegan Bowl and a good kids Burger, to <a href="https://ruokburger.fi">RUOK</a> and <a href="http://www.hankibaari.fi">Hankibaari</a> which have very good options for people with all kind of diets. We also cooked at least once a day in our apartment, basics like Pesto-Pasta and Pizza kept the food expenses low and were really good, too!</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-ruka">Getting to Ruka</h2>

<p>As I have <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/04/spring-skiing-in-ruka.html">said in the past</a>: The most convenient way is to take the <a href="http://vr.fi">train</a> and <a href="https://matkahuolto.fi">bus</a> to Ruka, or if you come from abroad you can fly to the <a href="https://www.finavia.fi/en/airports/kuusamo">Kuusamo Airport</a> and take the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/getting-around">Ski Bus</a> to the village and Ruka Valley. In the winter <a href="https://www.onnibus.com/">OnniBus</a> has direct connections from the south to Ruka which are really affordable and a really good option as one doesn’t need to change. On the train you can sleep, work and walk around, and during the bus trip you can enjoy the beautiful Finnish landscape while listening to your favourite tunes. We downloaded the Finnish version of the Donald Duck Comic magazine which allowed us to download hundreds of comics to the iPad, which made for a relaxing trip as my son was reading hours at a time on the bus &amp; train. Also some salty and sweet treats were handed out every now and then, and longer breaks were scheduled in so we didn’t need to stress in case a train or bus were running late.</p>

<p>The skiing season 2020 started in Ruka for me, and I was really happy to have my 8-year old son along. These kind of trips are great to bond with the kids, learn more about them, and of course also share my passion for the outdoors with them. Plenty of hot chocolates where consumed, Pokemons were caught, and of course we also had a lot of fun on the slopes of the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/">Ruka Ski Resort</a>!</p>

<p>Besides skiing the slopes every day, we also had a few activities planned. Ice climbing with <a href="https://www.outdoorpassion.fi/en/">Outdoor Passion Finland</a> for example.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I was in Germany for a few days with the Bergfreunde, and on Monday morning I woke up at 4 am to hike alone to the Top of Germany via the Stopselzieher Via Ferrata.</p>

<p>The weather forecast was “Thunderstorms, every day” at the start of my journey to the Zugspitze Region in Austria and Germany. But how it is with weather forecasts, they can be off sometimes, and as my Alarm rang at 4:00 o’clock on Monday morning I jumped out on the balcony, half wishing for lighting bolts to flash across the sky so I could head back to bed. However, a calm, dark blue sky with white, blinking stars was above me, and so I brushed my teeth, got dressed, headed to the Hotel restaurant to drink a coffee and then I was off. I heard some traffic in the distance, but soon I left the little village of Ehrwald behind me and hiked up one of the trailrunning trails to the Gamsalm, a small hut next to the ski slope. I followed this wide grassy hill upwards and another 20 minutes later I entered a low forest and a narrow trail. A frog surprised me by jumping almost under my foot, but in the beam of my headlamp I saw him and avoided an untimely end for him.</p>

<p>The trail took me up a scree field and the trees became smaller and smaller, until they completely disappeared. In the light of my headlamp I hiked up, the only sound being my panting. The first hour passed with almost 450 m of ascent, which is a tad too fast, and so I slowed down a bit, and as the sky started to became lighter I also could see more of my surroundings.</p>

<p>At the old middle station ruin I took a big gulp of water, a bite of my vegan chocolate bar, and continued on the Georg Jäger Steig trail. A group of chamois was grazing in the field above me, completely ignorant of me. I took a few photos of them, and followed the trail towards the ridge which would give me my first glance of the orange dawn. I could see the big, new pillar of the Gondola Station, which starts at 8:30-ish to ferry the first tourists to the top, and it’s about here that I put on my harness, Via Ferrata Set and Helmet. The trail is really exposed, narrow, and I didn’t want to risk falling down, but in the end I didn’t clip in even once as I didn’t find the trail as bad as I read.</p>

<p>To my surprise this section was really short and in a mere 10 minutes I stood in front of the Wiener Neustädter Hütte, one of the alpine huts of the Austrian Tourist Club. A dozen eyes of hikers and mountaineers looked down on me as I hiked up to the hut, I said Hallo, watched with them towards the sunrise, and then continued onwards towards the entry of the Stopselzieher Via Ferrata across the Schneekar scree field.</p>

<p>A helicopter was commuting to and from the summit, dropping off the supplies needed on the highest peak of Germany and also some construction goods, and I was happy when it flew off after a while so I could enjoy again the sound of the mountains. Now the Stopselzieher is a Via Ferrata with a Difficulty rating of A/B which means it is really easy, and experienced mountaineers probably won’t need a Via Ferrata Set, but if you’re a Beginner then use it to be safe on it. It’s a nice Via Ferrata which takes you through a small cave, and then climbs at a moderately steep angle upwards. You climb via steel ladders and natural rock up, and here and there are natural platforms which are useful for a short hydration break, catching your breath and enjoying the view.</p>

<p>I was lucky to be the first person on the Via Ferrata, and enjoyed the steep and exhausting climb up to the ridge. At the ridge I basked in the sun, took off my harness and helmet, put on my sunglasses and continued on the trail towards the top. The trail ascends here besides a lot of pipes and cables, and it isn’t the most pretty experience, but I didn’t mind. A group of young men hiked slowly in front of me, and from their conversations I gathered that they started at the Knorrhütte three hours ago.</p>

<p>And then I was at the Summit Station. A lot of people were already up here, because you also can sleep up here at the Münchner Haus of the German Alpine Club, but it also was now 9:00 o’clock and the first Gondolas had arrived at the top. I didn’t mind, it was nice to see so many people enjoying the beautiful sunny weather at the top of Germany, and after a bit of navigating I found the trail which lead me to the summit cross.</p>

<p>I sat for a long time on the summit, composing photos, and took in the magnificent view over the Jubläumsgrat Ridge. One day I’d like to ascend the Zugspitze via this Route.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48664400131/in/dateposted/" title="Jubiläumsgrat"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48664400131_ce54d81d93_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Jubiläumsgrat" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My original plan was to descend via the Gondola and relax for the rest of the day, but those who know me also know that I have difficulties to sit still and take the easy route. So while I was drinking a coffee and eating a Pretzel, an idea hatched in my mind: I could hike back via the Gatterl Route to Ehrwald, making a pretty loop of this trip. It was so early in the day still that I had plenty of time before the promised Thunderstorms, it was nice and sunny and the friendly chap at the DAV hut refilled my water bottles for free, so around 11 o’clock I descended to the Zugspitzplatt and ran on the trail to the Knorrhaus Hut.</p>

<p>Now this trail to the Knorrhütte was very, very busy. The Route via the Knorrhütte is one of the easiest as you have no climbing to do, but I didn’t really like this bit. The descent of the screefield on the lose trail was fine, but it is the kind of trail which I wouldn’t want to hike up. Going against the flow was fine, however! At the Knorrhütte I used my last cash to buy a peasoup and a tasty elderberry drink, and as it was still some 26°C I also refilled all three of my water bottles at the well. And then I was off towards the Gatterl, the border between Germany and Austria.</p>

<p>In this time and age where backward morons want to again build up border walls and refuse people entry into a country it is beautiful to walk on my own feet over a border, without anyone asking for my passport or anything. I walked to the gate, said bye to Germany and continued on the trail to the Ehrwald Alm.</p>

<p>I got really tired on this stretch, and as I passed a small stream I sat down, took off my shoes and cooled down my dear feet. A big gulp of water, some more vegan chocolate and I had the energy I needed to continue to the end. After the Ehrwald Alm more and more people were sharing the trail with me, and it was beautiful to have so many fellow humans enjoying the beautiful nature here. Four kilometres from Ehrwald I heard the first thunder 🌩 and I put some more speed into my steps so I wouldn’t need to get the rain jacket out of the pack. Alas, I wasn’t fast enough, and about 500 m from the Hotel the Thunderstorm reached me!</p>

<p>I stopped my Suunto at 16 o’clock in front of the Hotel, with a big smile. I did it! I climbed to the top of Germany and hiked back to Ehrwald with <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2653488336">a beautiful loop</a>, and it only took me some 8 hours! I entered my Hotel, had a well-deserved coffee and then went to stretch &amp; relax in the Sauna!</p>

<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities</h2>

<p>I stayed at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/at/family-wellnesshotel-tirolerhof.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Tiroler Hof Hotel in Ehrwald</a> which is ideal for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts. It’s close to the centre of the village and the various trails go past the front of the hotel. It has a delicious breakfast, great views and a large Spa with nice Sauna for relaxing after a day in the mountains. I started and ended my hikes and activities in Ehrwald all here, and would go there again.</p>

<p>Ehrwald and my route up the Zugspitze are still one of the less popular routes, as it is very steep. However, I saw on my descent many groups of people heading to the Via Ferrata, so I’d start as early as you’re comfortable getting up. I started my hike from the Hotel at 4:20 and had nobody in front of me, but if you take less photo breaks you also should be fine starting at 5:00 o’clock.</p>

<p>Gear-wise I’d recommend to go as light as possible. I wore my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/08/la-sportiva-tx2-review.html">La Sportiva TX2</a> shoes, the <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/en-de/men/pants/ms-motion-pants-245174?color=245174900">Houdini Motion Lite Pants</a>, an <a href="http://tidd.ly/3aa36651">Houdini Activist Message Tee</a>, and the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody</a> softshell. In my pack I had thin synthetic insulation jacket, the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/11/rab-microlight-alpine-jacket.html">Rab Microlight Alpine Jacket</a> and my Houdini Aegis Hardshell which I all didn’t need (I run very easily really hot and it was a warm day, but weather can change quickly in the mountains so I go prepared). In the morning I had the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/petzl-bindi-head-torch/?pid=10239">Petzl Bindi</a> on my head to illuminate the trail, and for the Via Ferrata section I wore the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/09/petzl-sirocco-2-dot-0-review.html">Petzl Sirocco Helmet</a>, a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/camp-alp-racing-climbing-harness/?pid=10239">Camp ALP Harness</a> and the <a href="http://tidd.ly/b258a541">Edelrid Cable UL</a> Via Ferrata Set. All of that was in my trusty <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de">HUCKEPACKS</a> pack 🤗 when not needed, and I also had three 0,5 l Softflasks with me full of water which I refilled whenever I could. Add in a few vegan chocolate and Müsli bars and you have a lightweight pack for a fun day in the mountains!</p>

<p>I took the train to Ehrwald after flying in to München. It’s fast, cheap and convenient, and you can see the beautiful panorama from the train without standing still with you car. You pass Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and with the Guest Card from the Hotel you can take the local Bus around the mountain to also take different routes up and down.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The skiing season 2019 isn’t over just yet - there’s still great snow to be shredded in the far North of Finland, as I experienced last weekend in Ruka.</p>

<p>As part of me trying to minimize my environmental footprint but unwilling to not ski I travelled last weekend by train and bus to Ruka-Kuusamo, some 500 kilometres from Vaasa away. Even with short stop-overs between switching from the train to the Bus it’s almost a 10 hour journey to get to Ruka, though as you can walk around in the train, there’s good internet and you can work there’s nothing to worry about. Though I was happy that I was able to get out on the hills once I arrived in Ruka, and with the lifts being open till 19 o’clock I got in a few hours of skiing on the slopes after a full day of travelling - not a bad start! And to make it even better, it had been snowing the whole Thursday and would continue throughout the night.</p>

<p>After the skiing I went to have Dinner at <a href="https://ruokburger.fi">RUOK Burger</a> which is just next door from my apartment in the <a href="https://www.ski-inn.fi/en/majoitus/ruka">Ruka Village Ski-Inn</a>. Their Portobello Burger was the only vegetarian option and super-tasty, and I accompanied it with a local Craft Beer from Rovaniemi, a nice Amber Lager. After that I retired to my cozy apartment, heated up the Sauna and watched how it was snowing outside. Being on ski holidays it is always great to watch it snow ❄️ as that means fresh powder the next day when you’re outside on the hills!</p>

<p>The next morning a bright blue sky woke me up, and all signs were on an amazing day on and off the slopes. There’s just something great about hitting the slopes and being one of the first ones there. I love painting my curves into the still un-shredded corduroy, and then Veera and me went into the side-country to look for some powder. And powder we found.</p>

<p>It really feels amazing to surf through the fluffy snow and throw up big swoops of the white gold. Veera and me both had big smiles on our faces after cruising through the powder-filled forests, so once it was noon we went to <a href="http://www.hankibaari.fi">Hanki Baari</a> for lunch, where I ate a tasty vegan Mie Goreng. Hanki Baari is either way an amazing place to chill after a day on the slopes, listening to music and drinking some fancy beers, though right now we just needed some good nutrition before hitting the slopes again.</p>

<p>So, after a coffee ☕️ it was time to go ride some more. After all, the sun was shining, the slopes were in prime condition and the lifts would be running till 23 o’clock (Fridays the Ruka Ski Resort’s lifts run so late because those who journey after work to Ruka still can hit the illuminated slopes!). However, we wouldn’t ski that long, as we had another plan.</p>

<p>We went on a little powder hunt with friends of Veera, which resulted in a short but exhausting climb through hip-deep snow back to the slopes from the lake 🤣 After that I went for a few more laps on the slopes before calling it a day. A quick shower later I was sitting in the <a href="https://www.pizzeriaruka.fi/en/">Pizzeria Ruka</a> which is probably the best Pizza you can get in Ruka. It’s a five minute stroll from the centre of the village to the Pizzeria, and their wood-fired oven served me in no time a delicious Tartufo Pizza. That’s exactly what I needed after almost six hours of skiing, and gave me enough energy for the hike we had planned for the evening.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://www.hendrikmorkel.com">photographer</a> I hate it to spend a gorgeous sunset inside, so I was happy that Veera and her dog were up for a sunset mission to Konttainen, a hill some 10 minutes away from Ruka. A steep 11 minute climb later we were on the top of Konttainen, and strolled towards the best spot in the house while the show was just starting. It’s soooooo much better to be outside in nature when the sun sets than sitting inside, and this definitely was an evening well spent. After the sun disappeared from view we gazed for a while onto the illuminated slopes of Ruka, and for a moment I was tempted to jump back into my <a href="http://bit.ly/2D2JtFL">ski boots</a> and go for some night skiing. But then I remembered my warm Sauna and the cold beer which were waiting for me, so I skipped the night skiing and relaxed in my apartment before calling it a night.</p>

<p>The next morning white clouds hung over the mountain and gave the slopes and village a sci-fi feel. I’s the kind of weather where you ponder if you should just stay inside and chill-lax, but as I wanted to get my skis on that didn’t happen and early on Saturday morning Veera and me where again on the slopes, searching for some untracked pockets of powder.</p>

<p>And slowly but surely the sun was burning through the clouds and as the day progressed the views came out again, and we also were lucky by finding some fine lines of untouched powder not far from the hustle and bustle of the slopes.</p>

<p>After all that off-piste skiing it was time to join the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/ski-pride">Ruka Ski Pride</a> Parade. I really ❤️ that Ruka has this event which celebrates equal rites and diversity on the slopes, and the vibe was so positive and fun - I really enjoyed to be part of it 🌈 Besides this parade there were inclusive events the whole weekend, with concerts and DJs, and of course some good skiing!</p>

<p>And then the day was almost over again. But not before I skied one final time from the East to the West, and from the North to the South across the whole resort. I love to ski fast and go from one end of a resort to the other one, shredding down the slopes and throwing up clouds of slushy spring snow, and at the end of this Saturday my trusty <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/suunto-spartan-ultra-black-multifunktionsuhr/?pid=10239">Suunto Spartan Ultra</a> told me I had skied almost 50 km of distance this day, and I could tell by how my legs felt.</p>

<p>After some relaxing I met Mats for Dinner at <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/villisika">Villisika</a> from where you have the best view over the slopes, so while we were eating we could see how the snow groomers got the hill ready for the next day. Sadly, the next sunny day I wouldn’t be shredding the groomers, as I was sitting in the train and bus back south. But I have a feeling that I will travel North once more for more skiing before the winter truly ends ❄️</p>

<h2 id="spring-skiing-in-ruka">Spring Skiing in Ruka</h2>

<p>As you can see above, winter isn’t over just yet in Finnish Lapland, even if it may feel like it here in the south where most of the snow is already gone. Until early May there’s plenty of great skiing to be had in Northern Finland, and if you’re like me and can not get enough of skiing and winter then you too should steal away for a weekend to Ruka for some spring skiing. The slopes in <a href="https://www.ruka.fi">Ruka</a> are open till early May, and between now and the closing of the slopes there’s every weekend a weekend of fun to be had: Next weekend, from the 11.4. - 14.4.2019 is the legendary <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/spring-break">Ruka Spring Break</a> which will enlighten those who like to Party between hitting the groomers. The <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/easter">Easter Weekend</a> has winter activities for the whole family on offer, and the first of May is the traditional <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/wappulounas">Wappulounas</a>, a get-together of the international snowboard community on the slopes of Ruka. So don’t ponder longer - go and get some of that spring snow!</p>

<h2 id="where-to-stay">Where to Stay</h2>

<p>I stayed at the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/rukasuites">Ski Inn</a> and liked my apartment in the centre of the village. It was a two minute stroll to the Gondola and lift, a one minute walk to the supermarket, and Hanki Baari was even in the same building so I didn’t had to go far for a beer! There’s plenty more <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/where-to-stay">places to stay in Ruka</a> for any budget, and if you’re pondering where to eat: Just follow my recommendations above or try any of the other restaurants in the village and it’s surroundings.</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-ruka">Getting to Ruka</h2>

<p>The most convenient way is to take the <a href="http://vr.fi">train</a> and <a href="https://matkahuolto.fi">bus</a> to Ruka, or if you come from abroad you can fly to the <a href="https://www.finavia.fi/en/airports/kuusamo">Kuusamo Airport</a> and take the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/getting-around">Ski Bus</a> to Ruka. On the train you can sleep, work and walk around, and during the bus trip you can enjoy the beautiful Finnish landscape while listening to your favourite tunes.</p>

<p>If “<a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-the-bregenzerwald.html">Bregenzerwald</a>” and “<a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-vorarlberg.html">Vorarlberg</a>” sound familiar to long-time readers of the blog, the reason is that I have been there with the family three years ago in the summer. We loved our stay and after I saw Warth briefly last year on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/03/impressions-from-the-mdv-transalp.html">MDV Transalp</a> I decided it’d be just the right place to go after ISPO 2019. But as skiing alone is boring and making photos of one skiing alone is pretty difficult, I asked my friend Björn from the <a href="https://st-bergweh.de">St. Bergweh</a> Blog if he’d like to accompany me. Björn is a great Snowboarder and we have similar values, so I was happy when he agreed to join on this trip! What follows are just a few visual impressions from this long weekend in Warth, the long-form article will follow in a bit!</p>

They live during the ski season down in Vorarlberg and hence know a lot of great secret spots!</p>

<p>We skied both on the slopes of <a href="https://www.warth-schroecken.com/en/warth-schroecken-ski-area.html">Warth-Schröcken</a> and <a href="https://www.skiarlberg.at/en">Ski Arlberg</a>, to which the former belongs, while the latter is the largest skiing resort of Austria. But besides hitting the slopes we also found a few spots of untracked powder, which we enjoyed to no small degree.</p>
