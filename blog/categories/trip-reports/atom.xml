<p>I started my trip in Lapland with five days of backpacking in the Hammastunturi Wilderness Area.</p>

<p>Golddiggers, fast-flowing rivers for fishing and packrafting, cozy open huts, almost no people, beautiful fjells with great views, Hammastunturi has it all.</p>

<p>After five days in the wilderness I returned to Saariselk√§, had a hot shower and Sauna, and enjoyed several <a href="https://polarlifeoutdoor.com">Polarlife Outdoor</a> experiences. First I went hiking with Henna from Lapland Life in her backyard. A backyard with some stupendously good views, too.</p>

<p>The next day Minna from Arctic Sky Lapland went mushroom and berry picking with me, and then she prepared over the fire the most tasty vegan meal out of it. My mouth is watering just thinking about it now!</p>

<p>And on the third day Tiina and Reima, the owners of Saariselk√§ Training, showed me their local Mountain bike trails. And let me tell you, they‚Äôre nothing short of amazing!</p>

<p>Obviously there also was tasty food in the village of Saariselk√§, Sauna visits, dips in a lovely stream, and hikes in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/urho-kekkonen-national-park.html">Urho Kekkonen National Park</a>.</p>

<p>The weather forecast was ‚ÄúThunderstorms, every day‚Äù at the start of my journey to the Zugspitze Region in Austria and Germany. But how it is with weather forecasts, they can be off sometimes, and as my Alarm rang at 4:00 o‚Äôclock on Monday morning I jumped out on the balcony, half wishing for lighting bolts to flash across the sky so I could head back to bed. However, a calm, dark blue sky with white, blinking stars was above me, and so I brushed my teeth, got dressed, headed to the Hotel restaurant to drink a coffee and then I was off. I heard some traffic in the distance, but soon I left the little village of Ehrwald behind me and hiked up one of the trailrunning trails to the Gamsalm, a small hut next to the ski slope. I followed this wide grassy hill upwards and another 20 minutes later I entered a low forest and a narrow trail. A frog surprised me by jumping almost under my foot, but in the beam of my headlamp I saw him and avoided an untimely end for him.</p>

<p>The trail took me up a scree field and the trees became smaller and smaller, until they completely disappeared. In the light of my headlamp I hiked up, the only sound being my panting. The first hour passed with almost 450 m of ascent, which is a tad too fast, and so I slowed down a bit, and as the sky started to became lighter I also could see more of my surroundings.</p>

<p>At the old middle station ruin I took a big gulp of water, a bite of my vegan chocolate bar, and continued on the Georg J√§ger Steig trail. A group of chamois was grazing in the field above me, completely ignorant of me. I took a few photos of them, and followed the trail towards the ridge which would give me my first glance of the orange dawn. I could see the big, new pillar of the Gondola Station, which starts at 8:30-ish to ferry the first tourists to the top, and it‚Äôs about here that I put on my harness, Via Ferrata Set and Helmet. The trail is really exposed, narrow, and I didn‚Äôt want to risk falling down, but in the end I didn‚Äôt clip in even once as I didn‚Äôt find the trail as bad as I read.</p>

<p>To my surprise this section was really short and in a mere 10 minutes I stood in front of the Wiener Neust√§dter H√ºtte, one of the alpine huts of the Austrian Tourist Club. A dozen eyes of hikers and mountaineers looked down on me as I hiked up to the hut, I said Hallo, watched with them towards the sunrise, and then continued onwards towards the entry of the Stopselzieher Via Ferrata across the Schneekar scree field.</p>

<p>A helicopter was commuting to and from the summit, dropping off the supplies needed on the highest peak of Germany and also some construction goods, and I was happy when it flew off after a while so I could enjoy again the sound of the mountains. Now the Stopselzieher is a Via Ferrata with a Difficulty rating of A/B which means it is really easy, and experienced mountaineers probably won‚Äôt need a Via Ferrata Set, but if you‚Äôre a Beginner then use it to be safe on it. It‚Äôs a nice Via Ferrata which takes you through a small cave, and then climbs at a moderately steep angle upwards. You climb via steel ladders and natural rock up, and here and there are natural platforms which are useful for a short hydration break, catching your breath and enjoying the view.</p>

<p>I was lucky to be the first person on the Via Ferrata, and enjoyed the steep and exhausting climb up to the ridge. At the ridge I basked in the sun, took off my harness and helmet, put on my sunglasses and continued on the trail towards the top. The trail ascends here besides a lot of pipes and cables, and it isn‚Äôt the most pretty experience, but I didn‚Äôt mind. A group of young men hiked slowly in front of me, and from their conversations I gathered that they started at the Knorrh√ºtte three hours ago.</p>

<p>And then I was at the Summit Station. A lot of people were already up here, because you also can sleep up here at the M√ºnchner Haus of the German Alpine Club, but it also was now 9:00 o‚Äôclock and the first Gondolas had arrived at the top. I didn‚Äôt mind, it was nice to see so many people enjoying the beautiful sunny weather at the top of Germany, and after a bit of navigating I found the trail which lead me to the summit cross.</p>

<p>I sat for a long time on the summit, composing photos, and took in the magnificent view over the Jubl√§umsgrat Ridge. One day I‚Äôd like to ascend the Zugspitze via this Route.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48664400131/in/dateposted/" title="Jubil√§umsgrat"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48664400131_ce54d81d93_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Jubil√§umsgrat" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My original plan was to descend via the Gondola and relax for the rest of the day, but those who know me also know that I have difficulties to sit still and take the easy route. So while I was drinking a coffee and eating a Pretzel, an idea hatched in my mind: I could hike back via the Gatterl Route to Ehrwald, making a pretty loop of this trip. It was so early in the day still that I had plenty of time before the promised Thunderstorms, it was nice and sunny and the friendly chap at the DAV hut refilled my water bottles for free, so around 11 o‚Äôclock I descended to the Zugspitzplatt and ran on the trail to the Knorrhaus Hut.</p>

<p>Now this trail to the Knorrh√ºtte was very, very busy. The Route via the Knorrh√ºtte is one of the easiest as you have no climbing to do, but I didn‚Äôt really like this bit. The descent of the screefield on the lose trail was fine, but it is the kind of trail which I wouldn‚Äôt want to hike up. Going against the flow was fine, however! At the Knorrh√ºtte I used my last cash to buy a peasoup and a tasty elderberry drink, and as it was still some 26¬∞C I also refilled all three of my water bottles at the well. And then I was off towards the Gatterl, the border between Germany and Austria.</p>

<p>In this time and age where backward morons want to again build up border walls and refuse people entry into a country it is beautiful to walk on my own feet over a border, without anyone asking for my passport or anything. I walked to the gate, said bye to Germany and continued on the trail to the Ehrwald Alm.</p>

<p>I got really tired on this stretch, and as I passed a small stream I sat down, took off my shoes and cooled down my dear feet. A big gulp of water, some more vegan chocolate and I had the energy I needed to continue to the end. After the Ehrwald Alm more and more people were sharing the trail with me, and it was beautiful to have so many fellow humans enjoying the beautiful nature here. Four kilometres from Ehrwald I heard the first thunder üå© and I put some more speed into my steps so I wouldn‚Äôt need to get the rain jacket out of the pack. Alas, I wasn‚Äôt fast enough, and about 500 m from the Hotel the Thunderstorm reached me!</p>

<p>I stopped my Suunto at 16 o‚Äôclock in front of the Hotel, with a big smile. I did it! I climbed to the top of Germany and hiked back to Ehrwald with <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2653488336">a beautiful loop</a>, and it only took me some 8 hours! I entered my Hotel, had a well-deserved coffee and then went to stretch &amp; relax in the Sauna!</p>

<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities</h2>

<p>I stayed at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/at/family-wellnesshotel-tirolerhof.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Tiroler Hof Hotel in Ehrwald</a> which is ideal for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts. It‚Äôs close to the centre of the village and the various trails go past the front of the hotel. It has a delicious breakfast, great views and a large Spa with nice Sauna for relaxing after a day in the mountains. I started and ended my hikes and activities in Ehrwald all here, and would go there again.</p>

<p>Ehrwald and my route up the Zugspitze are still one of the less popular routes, as it is very steep. However, I saw on my descent many groups of people heading to the Via Ferrata, so I‚Äôd start as early as you‚Äôre comfortable getting up. I started my hike from the Hotel at 4:20 and had nobody in front of me, but if you take less photo breaks you also should be fine starting at 5:00 o‚Äôclock.</p>

<p>Gear-wise I‚Äôd recommend to go as light as possible. I wore my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/08/la-sportiva-tx2-review.html">La Sportiva TX2</a> shoes, the <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/en-de/men/pants/ms-motion-pants-245174?color=245174900">Houdini Motion Lite Pants</a>, an <a href="http://tidd.ly/3aa36651">Houdini Activist Message Tee</a>, and the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody</a> softshell. In my pack I had thin synthetic insulation jacket, the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/11/rab-microlight-alpine-jacket.html">Rab Microlight Alpine Jacket</a> and my Houdini Aegis Hardshell which I all didn‚Äôt need (I run very easily really hot and it was a warm day, but weather can change quickly in the mountains so I go prepared). In the morning I had the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/petzl-bindi-head-torch/?pid=10239">Petzl Bindi</a> on my head to illuminate the trail, and for the Via Ferrata section I wore the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/09/petzl-sirocco-2-dot-0-review.html">Petzl Sirocco Helmet</a>, a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/camp-alp-racing-climbing-harness/?pid=10239">Camp ALP Harness</a> and the <a href="http://tidd.ly/b258a541">Edelrid Cable UL</a> Via Ferrata Set. All of that was in my trusty <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de">HUCKEPACKS</a> pack ü§ó when not needed, and I also had three 0,5 l Softflasks with me full of water which I refilled whenever I could. Add in a few vegan chocolate and M√ºsli bars and you have a lightweight pack for a fun day in the mountains!</p>

<p>I took the train to Ehrwald after flying in to M√ºnchen. It‚Äôs fast, cheap and convenient, and you can see the beautiful panorama from the train without standing still with you car. You pass Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and with the Guest Card from the Hotel you can take the local Bus around the mountain to also take different routes up and down.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The skiing season 2019 isn‚Äôt over just yet - there‚Äôs still great snow to be shredded in the far North of Finland, as I experienced last weekend in Ruka.</p>

<p>As part of me trying to minimize my environmental footprint but unwilling to not ski I travelled last weekend by train and bus to Ruka-Kuusamo, some 500 kilometres from Vaasa away. Even with short stop-overs between switching from the train to the Bus it‚Äôs almost a 10 hour journey to get to Ruka, though as you can walk around in the train, there‚Äôs good internet and you can work there‚Äôs nothing to worry about. Though I was happy that I was able to get out on the hills once I arrived in Ruka, and with the lifts being open till 19 o‚Äôclock I got in a few hours of skiing on the slopes after a full day of travelling - not a bad start! And to make it even better, it had been snowing the whole Thursday and would continue throughout the night.</p>

<p>After the skiing I went to have Dinner at <a href="https://ruokburger.fi">RUOK Burger</a> which is just next door from my apartment in the <a href="https://www.ski-inn.fi/en/majoitus/ruka">Ruka Village Ski-Inn</a>. Their Portobello Burger was the only vegetarian option and super-tasty, and I accompanied it with a local Craft Beer from Rovaniemi, a nice Amber Lager. After that I retired to my cozy apartment, heated up the Sauna and watched how it was snowing outside. Being on ski holidays it is always great to watch it snow ‚ùÑÔ∏è as that means fresh powder the next day when you‚Äôre outside on the hills!</p>

<p>The next morning a bright blue sky woke me up, and all signs were on an amazing day on and off the slopes. There‚Äôs just something great about hitting the slopes and being one of the first ones there. I love painting my curves into the still un-shredded corduroy, and then Veera and me went into the side-country to look for some powder. And powder we found.</p>

<p>It really feels amazing to surf through the fluffy snow and throw up big swoops of the white gold. Veera and me both had big smiles on our faces after cruising through the powder-filled forests, so once it was noon we went to <a href="http://www.hankibaari.fi">Hanki Baari</a> for lunch, where I ate a tasty vegan Mie Goreng. Hanki Baari is either way an amazing place to chill after a day on the slopes, listening to music and drinking some fancy beers, though right now we just needed some good nutrition before hitting the slopes again.</p>

<p>So, after a coffee ‚òïÔ∏è it was time to go ride some more. After all, the sun was shining, the slopes were in prime condition and the lifts would be running till 23 o‚Äôclock (Fridays the Ruka Ski Resort‚Äôs lifts run so late because those who journey after work to Ruka still can hit the illuminated slopes!). However, we wouldn‚Äôt ski that long, as we had another plan.</p>

<p>We went on a little powder hunt with friends of Veera, which resulted in a short but exhausting climb through hip-deep snow back to the slopes from the lake ü§£ After that I went for a few more laps on the slopes before calling it a day. A quick shower later I was sitting in the <a href="https://www.pizzeriaruka.fi/en/">Pizzeria Ruka</a> which is probably the best Pizza you can get in Ruka. It‚Äôs a five minute stroll from the centre of the village to the Pizzeria, and their wood-fired oven served me in no time a delicious Tartufo Pizza. That‚Äôs exactly what I needed after almost six hours of skiing, and gave me enough energy for the hike we had planned for the evening.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://www.hendrikmorkel.com">photographer</a> I hate it to spend a gorgeous sunset inside, so I was happy that Veera and her dog were up for a sunset mission to Konttainen, a hill some 10 minutes away from Ruka. A steep 11 minute climb later we were on the top of Konttainen, and strolled towards the best spot in the house while the show was just starting. It‚Äôs soooooo much better to be outside in nature when the sun sets than sitting inside, and this definitely was an evening well spent. After the sun disappeared from view we gazed for a while onto the illuminated slopes of Ruka, and for a moment I was tempted to jump back into my <a href="http://bit.ly/2D2JtFL">ski boots</a> and go for some night skiing. But then I remembered my warm Sauna and the cold beer which were waiting for me, so I skipped the night skiing and relaxed in my apartment before calling it a night.</p>

<p>The next morning white clouds hung over the mountain and gave the slopes and village a sci-fi feel. I‚Äôs the kind of weather where you ponder if you should just stay inside and chill-lax, but as I wanted to get my skis on that didn‚Äôt happen and early on Saturday morning Veera and me where again on the slopes, searching for some untracked pockets of powder.</p>

<p>And slowly but surely the sun was burning through the clouds and as the day progressed the views came out again, and we also were lucky by finding some fine lines of untouched powder not far from the hustle and bustle of the slopes.</p>

<p>After all that off-piste skiing it was time to join the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/ski-pride">Ruka Ski Pride</a> Parade. I really ‚ù§Ô∏è that Ruka has this event which celebrates equal rites and diversity on the slopes, and the vibe was so positive and fun - I really enjoyed to be part of it üåà Besides this parade there were inclusive events the whole weekend, with concerts and DJs, and of course some good skiing!</p>

<p>And then the day was almost over again. But not before I skied one final time from the East to the West, and from the North to the South across the whole resort. I love to ski fast and go from one end of a resort to the other one, shredding down the slopes and throwing up clouds of slushy spring snow, and at the end of this Saturday my trusty <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/suunto-spartan-ultra-black-multifunktionsuhr/?pid=10239">Suunto Spartan Ultra</a> told me I had skied almost 50 km of distance this day, and I could tell by how my legs felt.</p>

<p>After some relaxing I met Mats for Dinner at <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/villisika">Villisika</a> from where you have the best view over the slopes, so while we were eating we could see how the snow groomers got the hill ready for the next day. Sadly, the next sunny day I wouldn‚Äôt be shredding the groomers, as I was sitting in the train and bus back south. But I have a feeling that I will travel North once more for more skiing before the winter truly ends ‚ùÑÔ∏è</p>

<h2 id="spring-skiing-in-ruka">Spring Skiing in Ruka</h2>

<p>As you can see above, winter isn‚Äôt over just yet in Finnish Lapland, even if it may feel like it here in the south where most of the snow is already gone. Until early May there‚Äôs plenty of great skiing to be had in Northern Finland, and if you‚Äôre like me and can not get enough of skiing and winter then you too should steal away for a weekend to Ruka for some spring skiing. The slopes in <a href="https://www.ruka.fi">Ruka</a> are open till early May, and between now and the closing of the slopes there‚Äôs every weekend a weekend of fun to be had: Next weekend, from the 11.4. - 14.4.2019 is the legendary <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/spring-break">Ruka Spring Break</a> which will enlighten those who like to Party between hitting the groomers. The <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/easter">Easter Weekend</a> has winter activities for the whole family on offer, and the first of May is the traditional <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/wappulounas">Wappulounas</a>, a get-together of the international snowboard community on the slopes of Ruka. So don‚Äôt ponder longer - go and get some of that spring snow!</p>

<h2 id="where-to-stay">Where to Stay</h2>

<p>I stayed at the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/rukasuites">Ski Inn</a> and liked my apartment in the centre of the village. It was a two minute stroll to the Gondola and lift, a one minute walk to the supermarket, and Hanki Baari was even in the same building so I didn‚Äôt had to go far for a beer! There‚Äôs plenty more <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/where-to-stay">places to stay in Ruka</a> for any budget, and if you‚Äôre pondering where to eat: Just follow my recommendations above or try any of the other restaurants in the village and it‚Äôs surroundings.</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-ruka">Getting to Ruka</h2>

<p>The most convenient way is to take the <a href="http://vr.fi">train</a> and <a href="https://matkahuolto.fi">bus</a> to Ruka, or if you come from abroad you can fly to the <a href="https://www.finavia.fi/en/airports/kuusamo">Kuusamo Airport</a> and take the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/getting-around">Ski Bus</a> to Ruka. On the train you can sleep, work and walk around, and during the bus trip you can enjoy the beautiful Finnish landscape while listening to your favourite tunes.</p>

We loved our stay and after I saw Warth briefly last year on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/03/impressions-from-the-mdv-transalp.html">MDV Transalp</a> I decided it‚Äôd be just the right place to go after ISPO 2019. But as skiing alone is boring and making photos of one skiing alone is pretty difficult, I asked my friend Bj√∂rn from the <a href="https://st-bergweh.de">St. Bergweh</a> Blog if he‚Äôd like to accompany me. Bj√∂rn is a great Snowboarder and we have similar values, so I was happy when he agreed to join on this trip! What follows are just a few visual impressions from this long weekend in Warth, the long-form article will follow in a bit!</p>

<p>We were lucky enough to also meet up with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/posayshirts/">Nina</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dirkofposay/">Dirk</a> and have a fun afternoon with them. They live during the ski season down in Vorarlberg and hence know a lot of great secret spots!</p>

<p>We skied both on the slopes of <a href="https://www.warth-schroecken.com/en/warth-schroecken-ski-area.html">Warth-Schr√∂cken</a> and <a href="https://www.skiarlberg.at/en">Ski Arlberg</a>, to which the former belongs, while the latter is the largest skiing resort of Austria. But besides hitting the slopes we also found a few spots of untracked powder, which we enjoyed to no small degree.</p>

<p>After my visit to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/active-holidays-in-are-sweden.html">√Öre in the autumn</a> I knew I wanted to come back, and that I should bring my family so we can experience the beauty of the Swedish mountains together! Again we travelled by ferry and train to this little village, which is in the midst of preparing for the √Öre 2019 FIS Alpine World Ski Championship which start next week! As usual, this is a photo-intensive article which gives you a taste of the stories which will come when I return from the ISPO 2019 in Munich and some skiing in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-vorarlberg.html">Vorarlberg</a>!</p>

<p>Our 3-year old daughter learned to ski ‚ù§Ô∏è The smile on her face is amazing, and we are so proud of her!</p>

<p>Similarly, our 7 year old son also improved his skiing by bounds! While he learned to ski some years ago in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/01/skiing-in-vuokatti.html">Vuokatti</a> this year in √Öre he went big and bold! I had many great runs with him, and look forward to many more!</p>

<p>Also my wife and me had some time with one of the friendly Ski School instructors! I got a reminder on how to better control my skis and tips on getting down steep, shitty runs.</p>

<p>There also was some night skiing.</p>
