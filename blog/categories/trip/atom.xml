<p>Six years ago I hiked the Escapardenne Eislek Trail from Kautenbach in Luxembourg to La Roche-en-Ardenne in Belgium, and as I was fast back then (I was several years younger and carried less photo equipment 😁) I finished a day early and hence made a short trip to Berdorf and explored the local climbing crag and hiking trails. Since then I always wanted to go back to this corner of Luxembourg, and hike the <a href="https://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en">Mullerthal Trail</a>. Despite the on-going Pandemic I managed to fly to Germany, briefly visit my family and then travel by train and bus to Echternach in Luxembourg.</p>

<p>Together with my best friend Martin we were here to hike the complete Mullerthal Trail. There was just one problem: The weather forecast was wet. Wet as in <em>“It’s gonna rain the next nine days”</em> wet. Happily it didn’t end up raining all the time, but you’ll have to wait for that story in the detailed trip report later this month! For now I want to share some of my favourite impressions from this 112 km long trail with it’s three Routes:</p>

<p>You will be able to see some more photos on <a href="https://instagram.com/hendrikmorkel/">Instagram</a> this week before the article comes, so maybe give me a follow 😉 (and check out the Story Highlight Videos from the trail while you’re there!)! And if you can’t wait: The beech trees were still a vibrant green and just starting to put on their autumn 🍂 colours on as we left, so at least till the start of November you should be able to enjoy here the most beautiful autumn colours, in combination with the amazing rock formations and the very well marked trail!</p>

<p>Last week Friday we drove early in the morning North. North to Rokua. While in Vaasa only the maple trees have started to turn yellow, orange and red, up in Rokua my favourite season was already in full swing, and Birch trees stood in golden Dresses along the trails and lakes. It was beautiful.</p>

<p>We spent the weekend at the <a href="https://www.rokua.com/en">Rokua Health &amp; Spa Hotel</a>, which is located right in the middle of the Rokua GeoPark. From there we were able to go explore the surroundings easily.</p>

<p>We were both hiking and Mountain Biking, as there’s a superb MTB Trail Network in the area. I was lucky enough to have Hannu show me around on Friday afternoon, and M took part in a Mushroom Course on Saturday while I went hiking with the kids.</p>

<p>If we weren’t outside, we enjoyed the modern &amp; clean facilities at the Hotel. The kids loved the amazing Kid’s Playroom and were happy to play there by themselves. Happy kids, happy parents 😊</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>#NukuYöUlkona</strong> is an event from Suomen Latu, which inspires people in Finland (and elsewhere =) to sleep a night outside! This year I took the kids and our new family tent along, and we spent a beautiful afternoon, night and morning outside in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Kvarken Archipelago!</p>

<p>Packing for three is 3 times as complicated as packing for one - but as long as three spoons, three Kuksas and one stove, as well as Marshmallows, are along, nothing can go wrong! Seriously though, I had to make a list to make sure we had everything along on our hiking and camping trip for the #NukuYöUlkona Challenge. I also made them carry some gear - the older one a bit more, but even the small one carried 2 l of fresh water, her book and sleeping buddy for the whole 3,5 km without complaints!</p>

<p>I decided to take my small kids to Kvarken, and camp with them at Långgrundet, which is the fire and campsite I explored earlier in the year when I was <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/bjorko-panike-trail.html">packrafting here</a>. The trip had everything to go well: A great weather forecast with not too fresh temperatures during the night, clear skies to see the stars (and some faint Northern Lights!), a really nice trail, a lot less bugs than a few weeks ago still, and tasty berries along a nice trail. My wife dropped us off at Svedjehamn and then the three of us set out on the trail.</p>

<p>Along the trail we tasted lingonberries and Seabuckthorn berries, which grow a lot here in the Archipelago. They are a bit sour, but super healthy, and I find them really tasty. The kids got in the middle some Marshmallows as a motivation to keep going, but thanks to our regular Sunday hikes they are happy and able to walk longer distances - and so this 3,5 km trip was done after just an hour of hiking. As we arrived at Långgrundet we went to look together for the best spot for our <a href="https://tidd.ly/34LniCV">∞ new family tent</a>, and together picked a really good spot. I told the kids what’s most important, and they did a great job with pitching the tent and checking if it’s a flat spot =)</p>

<p>The next thing was what the kids waited for the most: Dinner! While I myself have a vegan diet since two years now, the kids like to eat some meat now &amp; then, and they wished to take some Bratwurst with us so we could grill them over the fire! They loved the grilled sausages which they ate around the fire hungrily, while I prepared two <a href="https://tidd.ly/2X2n0CX">∞ LYO Food meals</a> for us. We took them and our three long-handled Titanium spoons to the jetty, where we sat down in the setting sun and enjoyed our second dinner above the water. And because I wanted to make sure that they’re warm at night, we topped things off with a hot chocolate with more Marshmallows after that! Their bellies full they definitely were happy, and after brushing their teeth (they were not a fan of my <a href="https://amzn.to/3fd2AgD">∞ DentTabs</a>😁) the two of them retired to the tent and were reading with their headlamps on.</p>

<p>Once they put their lights off I went to take some photos.</p>

<p>I stayed up till a wee bit past midnight, as there was a good chance to see the Northern Lights that night, but ultimately was pretty tired and so also went to brush my teeth, topped off my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/therm-a-rest-neoair-uberlight-sleeping-mat/?pid=10239">∞ Uberlite</a> with one more puff and then snuggled up in my <a href="https://katabaticgear.com/shop/chisos-sleeping-bag/">Katabatic Gear Chisos</a> quilt. The kids were already peacefully sleeping under their own quilts (one <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/as-tucas-sestrals-quilt.html">As Tucas Sestrals Quilt</a> and one <a href="https://www.vaude.com/en-INT/Equipment/Sleeping-Bags-Mats/Sleeping-Bags/4792/Alpstein-450-DWN">Vaude Alpstein 450 quilt</a>), and soon I too was sleeping - though there were a lot of Whopper Swans making noise around us, and also some sheep with bells were walking around.</p>

<p>The next morning the oldest one was up at 8 am, and together we got silently out of the tent while the little one continued to sleep in the middle. I started to prepare breakfast for us - instant chocolate porridge with strawberries and raspberries - and then picked the little one up when she woke up. Together we sat at one of the benches, eating all our porridge, enjoying the warm, sunny weather on this Sunday morning.</p>

<p>And then it was time to start to pack already and head back to Svedjehamn. I asked the kids if they’d like to pick some Seabuckthorn berries for us, which we could make into a cake at home, and much to my surprise they were up for it (they did get several Marshmallows as a reward, too 😃)! This was perfect, because while they were picking berries I was able to pack everything into our three backpacks - of which I had the biggest one, a <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=47cd1998-e608-4548-aa0f-3d33e964ad3a&amp;website_id=a037a589-aec6-4e81-920c-77b10ab91eff&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fhyperlitemountaingear.com%2Fcollections%2Fpacks%2Fproducts%2F3400-southwest">∞ Hyperlite Mountain gear SouthWest 3400</a>!</p>

<p>Soon after, we shouldered our much lighter packs, and started the enjoyable hike back.</p>

<p>An hour later our little adventure came to an end. Again we picked tasty lingonberries and Seabuckthorn berries along the way, passed the birdwatching tower and the picturesque red boat sheds, and gave mom a big hug when we met her at Svedjehamn!</p>

<p>It was a great little trip with my kids. They also enjoyed it a lot, and are already asking when we will go the next time! With autumn at our doorstep the best time to go hiking and backpacking just started, so I hope we get to explore some trails around Vaasa and camp out together soon again!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, practically I wasn’t alone in Lemmenjoki National Park, as there were about 17 Million Mosquitos, 3 Million Black (Horse) Flies, one Reindeer, one Hawk, one Eagle and dozens of tadpoles. But once I left the Gold Trail behind me, I was alone - and loved it!</p>

<p>You know what is the problem with Lapland? It’s so darn far away from Vaasa. To be precise, it’s a 4 hour train ride and an additional 12 hour car ride far away. That’s a lot of sitting on your buttocks, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oolaw/">Olli</a> and me were mighty happy to roll on the very full parking lot of Lemmenjoki at 23:00 o’clock on a Sunday night in July. Now Lemmenjoki is Finland’s largest National Park, with an area of 2860 km², but also pretty inaccessible if you don’t have a car - as there’s not really any public transportation going to the Park - <em>and</em> it is also a bit <em>“off-the-beaten-track”</em> so we were pretty surprised to find a full parking lot. But then it was July, the month where Finns traditionally take holidays, and there’s also this <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/04/planning-your-first-hike.html">Pandemic</a> going on so maybe it was obvious that Finns will flock to their National Parks?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50247531077/in/dateposted/" title="Sign at the Parking Lot"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50247531077_7078ba7797_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sign at the Parking Lot" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Anyway, after roughly 16 hours of sitting I put on my new <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/inov-8-mudclaw-g-260-trail-running-shoes/?pid=10239">∞ inov-8 Mudclaw G 260 shoes</a>, shouldered my heavy <a href="https://bit.ly/3l5QkTA">∞ Southwest pack</a> with food for nine days and all the packrafting gear, and then Olli and me hiked to the Muurhaislampi camp spot some 900 m away. The sun was still shining, there were a few Mosquitos accompanying us, and at the camp spot we also met some other hikers who were still up and pitching their shelters. Olli and me had an (non-alcoholic) beer to celebrate our arrival, and then it was off to sleep.</p>

<p>Well, I at least tried to sleep. A lonely Reindeer with a bell around its neck kept walking around the camp ground and the lake, the <em>“ding-dong, ding-dong”</em> of the bell keeping me well awake. I was up early thus, made my breakfast porridge and coffee and waited for Olli to appear. He’d accompany me for a few kilometres to the summit of Joenkielinen, before he would continue to Kevo Nature Reserve. A bit after 9:00 I started to hike, just to meet Olli an hour later at the Sotkajärvi Laavu, where he had breakfast and I another coffee (Olli isn’t one for a breakfast right after getting up!). The temperature was already warm - maybe around 21°C - by the time we started the climb up the fjell. I decided to leave my heavy pack down by the trail, and hid it a bit. Happily Finland is still a safe country where this is possible to do - I really enjoyed hiking up the mountain with nothing but my camera in hand and the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/05/huckepacks-beipack.html">HUCKEPACKS beiPACK</a> around my shoulder.</p>

<p>We summited 45 minutes later, a great speed for the 3 km and around 300 m of ascent, especially since it got warmer, and warmer. Up on the summit of Joenkielinen a stiff breeze was blowing which helped us cool down. Taking in the magnificent views we did: You could see till Norway in the North-West, the Muotkatunturi Wilderness Area in the North-East, and Hammastunturi in the East. Gentle, rolling hills in every direction, in between there were silver slices of water bodies on which the sun reflected, and of course forests 🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲. It was a great summit to view the surroundings, and a day later I’d be standing alone on an even higher summit. Olli and me said good-bye - we’d meet again at the weekend - and while he ran back to the Parking lot I hiked down to my backpack - which was still there!</p>

<p>The trail continued as before, on a beautiful esker ridge which became a forest. I reached Searitniva after a while, and used the boat ferry to get to the other side of the Lemmenjoki river. There was a canoe and a row boat on the shore, and several people sitting around the ring of fire. I checked out the day trip hut, and then took my shoes off and ate some of my chilli nuts in the sun. I tried to slow down, not hurry to much, but didn’t enjoy the loud talking from the other people, so soon shouldered my <a href="https://bit.ly/3l5QkTA">∞ SouthWest backpack</a> again and continued. The 5 km to Härkäkoski were not fun: Too much mosquitos and horseflies where buzzing around me, and while they couldn’t get me because of the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/sea-to-summit-nano-mosquito-headnet-mosquito-net/?pid=10239">∞ Sea to Summit Nano Mosquito Headnet</a> I was wearing, their buzzing sound wasn’t pleasant, and neither was the by now really hot weather. I also didn’t have a coffee and the lack of caffeine did the rest.</p>

<p>I arrived at Härkäkoski, where there’s a rental hut, a campground and another boat ferry. I filled up my BeFree water bottle, took the stove out and made myself a coffee, which made me feel a lot better. The next two kilometres to the Ravadasjärvi Hut felt amazing again, with a pretty trail, a lot less insects bothering me, and it also was less warm. I soon arrived at the Ravadasjärvi Hut, and it was 17 o’clock. A good time to stop hiking, but then I did want to go to Kultahamina.</p>

<p>I chilled in the sun, let my feet cool down in the water of the Lemmenjoki river, and then asked a dad with his two sons who were making dinner if they’d been to Kultahamina and if it is as pretty as here at Ravadasjärvi. <em>“Nope”</em> he said, this spot would be a lot nicer. I answered some of his questions, and then decided to call it a day and put my gear into one of the two open shelters and stay here. I did hike some 23 km after all, and this was a beautiful evening with the sun shining. I rolled out my quilt and mattress in the hut, and then went to sit outside to make dinner and a cup of tea. I got to chat with Maria, who was hiking on her own with her dog.</p>

<p>Later that evening Maria, her dog and me hiked to the Ravadaköngäs waterfalls, which were pretty in the evening light, and it also made for a good evening stroll. By 21 o’clock I was under my quilt in the bivy, the couple of mosquitos who found a way inside the hut trying to get to me, but without any success thanks to the mesh net. I slept a solid 10 hours till 7:00 the next morning, including a wee stroll in the middle of the night to photograph the sunrise which bathed Morgam-Viipus fjell in a beautiful light pink-orange glow.</p>

<p>I was the first one up that morning, and silently enjoyed my breakfast. I had a long day ahead of me - because I didn’t camp at Kultahamina an additional 7 km were on top of my guesstimated 25 km route for the day, so you won’t be surprised to read that I was on the trail before 9:00 o’clock. I passed Ravadaköngäs again, this time the sun shining on the waterfall, and I enjoyed seeing it in this light again. The trail to Kultahamina was gorgeous, and I enjoyed this section immensely. Beautiful soft forest trails, passing some tiny streams which provided me with fresh, cold water on this already warm day, were very welcome. The Morgamnive campsite, down by the Lemmenjoki river, looked really inviting and even better than where I slept the previous night, but this are things you can not know before.</p>

<p>I arrived at Kultahamina around 11:00 and was put off by the 15+ Quads with trailers which stood under tarps close to the jetty and the open wilderness hut. Up till the 1st of July it was legal to search for gold in the National Park with “engine-powered machine” but now you’re only allowed to use a spade and a gold wash pan. I had a look around Kultahamina and had a small porridge break at the campfire place. A bunch of people started to hike past me, and I saw that one of the boats had arrived at the jetty. There’s a useful motor boat shuttle service running from Njurkulahti to Ravadasköngäs and Kultahamina twice a day, and many people use this possibility to either go up or down the river - it’s around 20 km of hiking you skip that way.</p>

<p>I finished my porridge and coffee and started the next leg of my hike. My map suggested there’d be an old trail crossing the river over to the other side, but shortly after exploring it the result was that my brand-new <a href="https://tidd.ly/3kXJP4R">∞ inov-8 Mudclaw G 260</a> were no longer bright green, but muddy brown - and I still wasn’t on the other side, but now also had wet shoes and socks. Yay! So back to the jetty I went, inflated my <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/Anfibio-packrafts/Anfibio-Rebel-2K::889.html?language=en">packraft</a> and paddled in 3 minutes over to the other side.</p>

<p>Once I had the packraft stored away again, the hardest stretch of the whole trip started: Hiking up to the summit of Morgam-Viipus. Roughly 400 m of ascent over 2 km, it was steep - add in a temperature of 22°C degree and my Army of Mosquitos and Black-flies which accompanied me, and you can picture how happy I was when I left the forest behind me and was above the treeline, where a nice breeze blew at least the annoying mosquitos away! During that strenuous hike I also was pondering the question if mosquitos and black flies have a territory which they inhabit and which they do not leave, or if they are nomads and would accompany me till Sallivaara or Ivalo 🤔</p>

<p>At the summit I had another coffee and chilled in the sun. It was a pretty day, and a large stone circle kept the wind at bay. The views towards the West were superb, as was my planned route towards the South and Sallivaara - it looked like a long day was still ahead of me… I walked on the soft, mossy ground to Viibosoaivi, and then passed a beautiful camping spot by the two lakes between the summit of Viibosoaivi and Sállejohoaivi. Tadpoles were swimming between the stones at the shore, there was little wind, plenty of flat spots for my TrailStar and bivy, and there were no mosquitos! I really should have just camped there - something which I can write now in hindsight, and which you should do when you’re going backpacking in Lemmenjoki!</p>

<p>I continued to the summit of Sállejohoaivi, and had dinner with a view. It was 17 o’clock, I was hungry, and I knew I wouldn’t be any time soon at Sallivaara, so I might as well make my pack a bit lighter and eat up here. I had a tasty REAL Turmat Vegan meal, a cup of tea and a smile on my face about the beauty which surrounded me. The sun ☀️ still stood high in the sky and it was warm, something which I welcomed as it meant I could hike in my T-Shirt here above the treeline.</p>

<p>My planned route now took me down via some boulder fields, and then I crossed a reindeer fence and a small stream before climbing a boulder field back up towards Jänisvaarat. When I arrived there, past 19 o’clock, I realized I had to abandon my original plan of hiking all the summits on my route towards Sallivaara. I had wanted to summit Iso Jänispää, Pikku Jänispää, Jänispäät and Jänispään Etelälaki on my route towards my goal for the day, but it was late, I was getting tired after already over 20 km of hiking and I wanted to arrive not too late. So I switched to the Altimeter view on my <a href="https://www.suunto.com/fi-fi/Tuotteet/Urheilulaitteet-ulkoiluun/Suunto-Spartan-Ultra/Suunto-Spartan-Ultra-All-Black-Titanium/">Suunto Spartan Ultra</a> which helped me to stay on the same altitude - which meant I saved energy - while I skirted the Jänispää summits.</p>

<p>It was late - probably around 21:30 o’clock - when I stood on the summit of Jänispään Etelälaki. It felt the day went on forever by now, and I still had 5 km to go till Sallivaara. There were a few swamps which I had to cross, and as I now dropped down between the trees also my mosquitos friends were back around me, accompanying me on this final stretch. The hiking went through dense birch trees to swamps full of Labrador Tea to sparse pine forests, and of course shortly before reaching Sallivaara I had to cross a swamp and got wet feet. This seems to be Murphy’s Law for me - dry feet most of the day, but shortly before camp… they get wet. And muddy. Yay.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock I walk inside of one of the huts at Sallivaara. There’s plenty of open huts here, but I need a moment to find the Open Wilderness Hut which is for us backpackers and hikers. I hang my sweaty clothes up, light a wee fire - more to get rid of the mosquitos and dry my clothes than to make it warm inside. The thermometer outside says it’s still 18°C, and I grab my two water bottles and walk to the spring. I have to cross the whole area to get to the small water spring, and am upset that I didn’t take my camera with me. It’s the Golden Hour, and the Reindeer Herding site, the huts and especially the absolutely gorgeous swamp are bathed in a golden light, and it all looks fantastic. Just the mosquitos… probably feel this walking buffet is for them. My hands are the only exposed skin, but it’s insane how many mosquitos land on them and get smacked to death in seconds. I must have killed three dozen mosquitos just while filling the water bottles at the spring, and then make a small run to leave most of them behind. Back at my hut I am just tired. It were 33 km, 26 km off-trail over the fjells, and so I slip into my bivy, happy that the mosquitos again can not get to me, and soon fall asleep.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning I get up late - it’s 9:00 o’clock when I crawl out of my quilt. Minutes later the <a href="https://tidd.ly/34fQqle">∞ Windboiler</a> is emitting steam, and I pour the boiling water in my large Kupilka Kuksa for my coffee. After the coffee I make a LYO Food coconut porridge, and start packing up. But before hiking to the Repovesi bridge and starting the packrafting trip of the part, I want to explore Sallivaara. My first stop is the information hut, which has information booklets in four or five languages about this site. The stories are beautiful, and tell so much of how infrastructure developments up here in Lapland can significantly impact the lives of the local Sámi people. Also the stories about the wolves, which have killed reindeer - but never a human - are things I wish more people would know.</p>

<p>Next I hike up the hill. I felt like this wouldn’t be necessary as I was on much higher hills the previous day, and didn’t think that this wee summit has anything of interest to show. How wrong I was! I could see the magnificent swamp I saw the previous evening, many pretty forest islands in the swamp, lots of fine summits - and also the bridge I’d be hiking to! A bird of prey was calling, and some rain started to come down - just to stop a few minutes later. The views from the hill were great thus, and I was happy that I walked up. Back at the hut - it’s about one kilometre to the huts and the round-up fence - I shouldered my pack for the final 7 km of this trip.</p>

<p>These 7 km went through plenty of swamps, and all the mosquitos tried again and again and again to get a drop of blood from my hands. While the scenery was superb - I love hiking through swamps - the mosquitos and black flies, together with the warm weather, were really going on my nerves. It felt that if a breeze blew away a bunch of mosquitos while out in the open, 10 seconds later a new swarm was ready to annoy &amp; attack me. I was so happy when I reached the road - where still dozens of mosquitos were around - and had my packraft inflated &amp; packed, ready for the next leg of the trip.</p>

<p><strong>Lemmenjoki National Park</strong> was amazing. I loved hiking on the Gold Trail, checking out the great huts and campsites along the way, and am a bit sad that I didn’t explore the North-Western part more, and also didn’t have time to go further south and check out some of the Fire Watch-out Towers. There’s quite a few open Wilderness Huts in the park, but besides the Gold Trail not really any trails - which makes it ideal for off-trail adventures. Hiking above the treeline is easy and rewarding with great views and no mosquitos, and down by the Lemmenjoki river you can see &amp; learn about the gold rush history of the area.</p>

<p>The biggest down-side to Lemmenjoki is getting there. You can get with public transportation (for example via <a href="https://www.vr.fi/cs/vr/fi/etusivu">night train</a> till Rovaniemi + <a href="https://www.matkahuolto.fi">bus</a>) till Ivalo, but then you’ll need to invest around 90€ for the Taxi-ride to Njurkulahti - one-way. You always can try to split the costs for the Taxi ride with other hikers you might meet on the bus to Ivalo, or try to hitch a ride - here up North it can be really easy to get taken along. I was lucky that I was able to share a ride with Olli and that he dropped me off at the trailhead, but also that was a 12 hour ride from Jyväskylä (including some breaks!).</p>

<p>On the trail I encountered dozens of people, which surprised me as I didn’t expect so many people to come this far off-the-beaten track. But it seems there were many day hikers who used the motor boat shuttle up or down the river, so after the last pick-up around 19 or 20 o’clock in the evening only the backpackers are left, and they were few. I imagine in the off-season (beautiful autumn, starting soon!) you will encounter few people on the trail, and again no one off it. Make sure to have your navigation skills up-to-date, a map, compass and your favourite <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/383480947">∞ navigation app</a> along for off-trail adventures, and then get ready to explore Finland’s largest National Park!</p>
