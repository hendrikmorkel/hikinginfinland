<p>This trip was spontaneous. I posted online, looking for a ride to Lapland, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oolaw/">Olli</a> replied. Turns out, Olli and I got along really well, and I think this was just the first trip we went on together. Well, sort of together, as I went to Lemmenjoki National park, hiking south through it, to the Repojoki river, which would join the mighty Ivalojoki river a bit later, while Olli continued to the impressive Kevo National park and it’s amazing canyon. I have 190 gb of Video to go through and edit, so for the moment please enjoy these photos from the trip, where also the weather was really fantastic (though there were too many Mosquitos and Black Flies for my liking).</p>

<p>Lemmenjoki National Park was surprisingly busy. You only can get here with an own car, but the Parking Lots were full and there was a steady flow of people using the shuttle boats from Njurgulahti to Kultahamina and back. I spent 3 days here, and had a great time - even though I had to wear my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody-windproof-jacket/?pid=10239">Alpine Start Hoody</a> almost all the time because of the Mosquitos!</p>

<p>After crossing Lemmenjoki I inflated <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/Anfibio-packrafts/Anfibio-Rebel-2K::889.html?language=en">my packraft</a> at the Repojoki bridge we had passed three days earlier by car, and started to paddle. First I had some headwind and safety concerns (paddling on your own in big, wild rivers is not recommended) but after the first rapids, lots of sunshine and warm weather my mood turned and I was able to enjoy the packrafting for this and the following days.</p>

<p>Gear of the trip is by the way the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/sea-to-summit-nano-mosquito-headnet-mosquito-net/?pid=10239">Sea to Summit Nano Mosquito Headnet</a>. I was <strong>SOOOOOO Happy</strong> I had this along, as it meant together with <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/patagonia-live-simply-guitar-funfarer-cap-cap/?pid=10239">my cap</a> (and sometimes the hood of the Alpine Start Hoody) Mosquitos and Black Flies couldn’t get to me - and try they did! A detailed trip report will follow in August, together with a <a href="http://youtube.com/hendrikmorkel">Video</a> or two.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Hetta-Pallas cross country skiing trail has been for a very long time on my wish list, and amid the current chaos I was able to escape to the farthest North of Finland and ski this breathtakingly beautiful trail. <em>Here are my first impressions.</em></p>

<p>I started this trip in Hetta, which took me around 16 hours to travel to. A relaxing and cozy night at the Hetan Majatalo was spent in this calm village, and the next morning my Pulka and me started on the trail south towards Pallas, under beautiful sunshine.</p>

<p>The 2nd day was one of the most exhausting days outdoors in memory. I was absolutely destroyed after I arrived at Pahakuru Hut. But nature’s lightshow made up for it rather well.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49715787928/in/dateposted-public/" title="Hannunkuru Sauna"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49715787928_ac3c16c7a9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hannunkuru Sauna" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That the outside world also had an effect on this remote location was evident also in the middle of the trail.</p>

<p>In the end it was a beautiful trip, and I can’t wait to write it down and share it with you. It was exhausting, with a relentless wind which robbed me of much joy on some days, and the lingering worry of “<em>Do I get back home?</em>” as buses and trains were cancelled. In the end I had a lot of luck and thanks to a very kind couple got a ride from the middle of nowhere to Ylläs, where I spent another few days skiing and Fatbiking before I returned home to Vaasa.</p>
