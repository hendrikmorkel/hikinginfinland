<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rutalocura.com/">Ruta Locura</a> is one of those small cottages which know their trade and their ultralight materials, in in their case that’s carbon fibre. Josh has been building since the mid-2000s carbon fibre and titanium goods for ultralight backpackers, campers, fishermen and hunters alike, and their <a href="http://www.rutalocura.com/trekking_poles.html">Yana Trekking Poles</a> are some of the most versatile poles on the market. Not just are they great to pitch Pyramid shelters and tarps at the end of the day, they also can be transformed into a tenkara rod when you want to add some trout to the Menu in the evening! The poles are also light, as you would expect, and so durable that a pair should last with some proper care and maintenance at least half a lite time!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Winter is also the time for wearing toasty warm down jackets. But down does not equal down, and hence we as consumers need to sometimes steer companies into the right direction. One company which doesn’t need steering but is leading in responsibly manufactured down is <a href="http://www.mountain-equipment.de">Mountain Equipment</a> with their <a href="http://www.thedowncodex.co.uk">Down Codex</a>. Since many years they offer customers the ability to 100% trace the down in their sleeping bags and jackets, which means one can have peace of mind in knowing that the down which keeps one warm was gathered with animal welfare in mind. So back to that toasty jacket I mentioned: With winters being warmer in the last few years a jacket like the <a href="http://www.mountain-equipment.de/arete-hooded-jacket">Men’s Arete Hooded Jacket</a> is ideal for the temperatures one encounters in our winters. The 320 g light jacket comes with two zippered pockets for cold hands &amp; camera batteries, and the hood ensures also ears and neck don’t need to freeze. Best of all: The water-resistant down doesn’t collapse when the snow turns to slush, and with some smart layering one could use this down jacket all year around!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blackrockgear.com">Black Rock Gear</a> hails from Seattle, Washington, that city which is known for Nirvana, Rain, Starbucks and the Space Needle, and it’s location between Puget Sound and the Cascade Mountain range makes it a great location for outdoor enthusiasts. It’s thus no surprise that Black Rock Gear makes some of the finest &amp; lightest <a href="https://www.blackrockgear.com/gear/">Down Hats</a> available for outdoor enthusiasts around the globe. Take The Original Beanie for example, which was an instant classic when it launched several years ago. Filled with 950 fill power goose down and sewn with ultralight ripstop nylon it’s so light, you sometimes only realize it’s on your head because your ears are toasty! Also the <a href="https://www.blackrockgear.com/product/the-brg-sport-pack/">BRG Sport Pack</a> is a light daypack made from durable materials which is excellent for those Urban adventures one goes on. It’s water-proof zippers keeps the inside dry, and the two internal Mesh “Catch All” Pockets help with organzing on the go. The pack can be fully opened for easy packing and access, and the padded shoulder straps make it comfortable to carry all day long!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Quilts are what we ultralight backpackers &amp; climbers love most. Not only are they way lighter than a sleeping bag, but the freedom of movement and ease of use are at least as important. <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/">Enlightened Equipment</a> makes some of the most innovative <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/quilts/">quilts</a> on the market, and almost all of their quilts are Made-to-Order exactly like one wants it. Extra down and a slim cut? No problem! Synthetic insulation and a wide foot box? Also no problem! Tim and his employees are able to fulfil almost every wish when it comes to quilts, and once you have slept under an Enlightened Equipment Quilt you won’t ever go back to a sleeping bag!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Winter, that’s ski-touring season for me. I love to skin up a lonely mountain with a good friend or two, enjoy a warm cup of tea at the summit before dropping in and enjoying fresh powder &amp; untouched slopes on the way back to the valley. On a trip like this a good-fitting and functional ski-touring backpack is mandatory, and the <a href="http://www.marmot.de/content/en/collection_36&amp;c=892">Backcountry 32 Pack</a> from <a href="http://www.marmot.de/">Marmot</a> ticks those boxes very well. When you need to Bootpack it carries the skis in a A-Frame or diagonally, a Shovel and Probe Pocket give fast access to the essential tools when needed and the ergonomically designed shoulder harness makes the pack comfortably to carry all day long. Add in that it is light and durably made and you have pack that you’re looking forward to to carry when you get early in the morning to climb up a mountain!</p>
