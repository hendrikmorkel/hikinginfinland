<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Quilts are what we ultralight backpackers &amp; climbers love most. Not only are they way lighter than a sleeping bag, but the freedom of movement and ease of use are at least as important. <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/">Enlightened Equipment</a> makes some of the most innovative <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/quilts/">quilts</a> on the market, and almost all of their quilts are Made-to-Order exactly like one wants it. Extra down and a slim cut? No problem! Synthetic insulation and a wide foot box? Also no problem! Tim and his employees are able to fulfil almost every wish when it comes to quilts, and once you have slept under an Enlightened Equipment Quilt you won’t ever go back to a sleeping bag!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Winter, that’s ski-touring season for me. I love to skin up a lonely mountain with a good friend or two, enjoy a warm cup of tea at the summit before dropping in and enjoying fresh powder &amp; untouched slopes on the way back to the valley. On a trip like this a good-fitting and functional ski-touring backpack is mandatory, and the <a href="http://www.marmot.de/content/en/collection_36&amp;c=892">Backcountry 32 Pack</a> from <a href="http://www.marmot.de/">Marmot</a> ticks those boxes very well. When you need to Bootpack it carries the skis in a A-Frame or diagonally, a Shovel and Probe Pocket give fast access to the essential tools when needed and the ergonomically designed shoulder harness makes the pack comfortably to carry all day long. Add in that it is light and durably made and you have pack that you’re looking forward to to carry when you get early in the morning to climb up a mountain!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>December is the darkest month of the year, when the days get shorter and shorter until the winter solstice. That’s not ideal for being outdoors here up in the north, but that’s where <a href="http://www.suprabeam.com/">Suprabeam</a> comes in: With their <a href="http://www.suprabeam.com/uk/products/v3air">V3air Headlamp</a> and the <a href="http://www.suprabeam.com/uk/products/q3defend">Q3defend Torch</a> we bring light into the December darkness and can pursue our outdoor activities in the bright light of this headlamp and torch! The V3air is just 140 g but boost up to 250 Lumens, enough to shine up to 195 m far. The Q3defend Torch is even more powerful and also very versatile, and also waterproof! With these two lamps the darkness can come, because we’re ready for it!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.icebug.com/">ICEBUG</a> hails from Sweden and if they know one thing then it is how to have good grip on slippery surfaces like ice and snow when you’re out running. The <a href="http://int-shop.icebug.com/springa/40-49/dubbade/anima5-m-bugrip">Anima5 BUGrip</a> is a dream come true for us ultralight backpackers and trailrunners as one shoe tips the scales at 280 g in a Size 7.5! Add in plenty of durable Carbide Tips which will bite into the hardest snow &amp; ice to guarantee great grip as well as the weather shield membrane which is laminated to the backside of the upper textile and which prevents snow, cold air and slush to your feet when conditions are getting rough, and you have a shoe which is made for running in the North from October to April!</p>
