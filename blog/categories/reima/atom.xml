And as it just dumped some 30 cm of snow and the winter holidays start here in Pohjanmaa it is time to shed some light on the Reimatec Stavanger Overall and why we love it!</p>

<p>Last December the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Lasten-ulkovaatteet/Lasten-haalarit-ja-setit/Lasten-Reimatec®%2B-toppahaalari-Stavanger/p/520190F-8430">Reimatec Stavanger Overall</a> arrived at the Hiking in Finland HQ and was immediately declared awesome by our son and very relieved parents (because they in a moment no longer needed to help dressing him up =). To understand this one needs to know that our son always needed a little assistance when he needed to put on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/11/winter-fun-with-the-reima-mamid-jacket-and-procyon-pants.html">Jacket and Pants</a> when it was time to go out. While he could put them on himself he prefrred to that mom or dad help him get dressed for the cold. As we have a one year old who can’t yet dress herself up this meant we were at once dressing up two kids, plus ourselves, before we could go out. This can get tedious to say the least, so when we saw that he was happy to put on the overall (in less than a minute, including <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Asusteet/Pipot-ja-hatut/c/k61">hat</a>, <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/brands/buff/for--kids/?pid=10239">Buff</a> and the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Asusteet/Hanskat-ja-rukkaset/Talvirukkaset-ja--hanskat/c/k63">Reimatec Suunta mitts</a>) we were very happy parents indeed!</p>

<p>So, now the kid has dressed himself up to go out into the cold, but how does the overall stand up to the use &amp; abuse a 5 year old can throw at it? Very well, we’d say. We were ice skating, building igloos, climbing on rocks, had running competitions and played hide &amp; seek, in temperatures from 0°C to -20°C. The waterproof &amp; breathable outer shell material has taken all these activities in stride and hasn’t failed us yet, keeping wind, snow and wetness at bay. It’s pretty durable, too - climbing on rocks with the knees and then sliding them back down hasn’t done any damage to the material.</p>

<p>It’s easy to clean, too - just throw it into the washing machine (add a suitable <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/toko-eco-softshell-wash-250-ml-detergent/?pid=10239">detergent</a>) at 40°C and an hour later you can hang it up to dry. Because of the insulation it needs around 12 to 16 hours to thoroughly dry, so keep that in mind.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32329153543/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2937/32329153543_c4ea0971cb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Warmth-wise the overall is toasty and is sufficient on its own up to temperatures of -5°C with our son. When it gets colder than -5°C we add a <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Koululaisten-lastenvaatteet/Lasten-lämpökerrastot/Yläosat/Lasten-fleecetakki-Frans/p/536097-3710">fleece jacket</a> and <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Lasten-sisävaatteet/Alaosat/Lasten-fleecehousut-Argelius/p/526243-6980">fleece pants</a> underneath the overall, and that’s no problem as there’s room to spare without restricting movement. Speaking of movement, snow angles, climbing on rocks and at the play ground, skiing and ice skating all were easy to do as the overall does not restrict the freedom of movement.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32761950190/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/601/32761950190_525fece769_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Also otherwise we really like the Stavanger Overall: The inside suspenders are great when dressing up and in breaks as our son can undress the overall but with the suspenders still over his shoulders he’s able to walk around without that the top is hanging on the floor. The width of the overall can be adjusted via two inside elastics, making it as wide or narrow as you need it. There’s only two pockets on it which is just the right amount, and the insulated hood with a fur collar can be removed (the fake fur, too). The leg cuffs can also be adjusted in width, while the elastic cuffs keep wind and snow from getting into the sleeves. The reflective details are easy to overlook, but there’s plenty of them, from top to bottom, which makes the wearer very visible on these dark winter nights and morning.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32761950830/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/746/32761950830_918aa8078a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Some words on the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Koululaisten-lastenvaatteet/Asusteet/Hanskat-ja-rukkaset/Lasten-Reimatec®%2B--topparukkaset-Suunta/p/527252-9990">Reimatec Suunta mitts</a>, too. We got these at the same time than the overall but they haven’t been used as much - simply because it was way too warm for them most of this <em>“winter”</em>. Now that the thermometer has shown beautiful double digit minus degrees it was time to put them on, and for playing in the snow and walking to the kindergarden or to town these were great to keep the little hands warm. These mitts have a very warm fleece lining and a snug cuff which goes high, and they’re best from temperatures over -10°C in our experience. Anything above that and our son would run very hot &amp; sweaty in them. Because they’re so long it’s best to put the gloves on before the overall, this is simpler. There’s some help needed to get the hands in the gloves through the elastic cuffs of the overall, but compared with dressing a kid up completely it’s a minor thing!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32761952150/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3929/32761952150_1a2e9a9ff8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that with the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Lasten-ulkovaatteet/Lasten-haalarit-ja-setit/Lasten-Reimatec®%2B-toppahaalari-Stavanger/p/520190F-8430">Reimatec Stavanger Overall</a> we have a happy son that can dress up alone at home &amp; in the kindergarden, allows him to play outside in the cold winter weather, be visible in the mornings and evenings when it gets dark, and it is easy to undress when going inside for a hot chocolate! A happy son of course means also happy parents, so the Stavanger gets from us six thumbs up! It’s a very durable and well-designed kids overall and we just hope our daughter will be fine with the green colour once she is big enough to wear it in some three years =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30201863754/in/dateposted/" title="Up the Sled Hill"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5734/30201863754_12a9f5a583_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Up the Sled Hill" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Reima Mamid Jacket and Procyon Pants have been our choice of winter garments for our son, and this down-filled jacket and the warm and water-repellant pants have been great in keeping our little boy warm when the temperatures drop low. And low were the temperatures, not just here in Vaasa but also up North in Lapland on our <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/winter-family-adventures-in-pyha-luosto.html">Family winter holiday in Pyhä</a> - which is a great place to take your kids for a relaxed &amp; adventurous winter holiday!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17075087012/in/album-72157651506091295/" title="That one next, dad!"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7599/17075087012_e945efd6da_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="That one next, dad!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Mamid jacket has everything you’d expect of your own jacket: Taped seams, windproof, water-proof and a toasty warm insulation of Reima 60 Down (that means there’s a mix of 60% Down to 40% feathers, which I found a good combination as when our son is a lot less careful when he is out playing, and the high feather percentage means the down can do its job and does not get compressed to easily). The hood with the fake fur is great when standing on a cold fjell top or at night when watching the stars and Northern Lights. It can be removed when not needed, which is useful for those chilly but sunny autumn and spring days. The waist can be adjusted by a drawstring on the inside so it is close to the body, and the sleeves have Velcro cuffs so no cold breeze or snow come in.</p>

<p>I don’t know what is the obsession with pockets on Kids garments, maybe the manufacturers just adapt adult designs and make them smaller? At least I feel that most <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/kids-gear/">Kids garments</a> have too many pockets. The Mamid for example would have been fine with just the two large flap pockets, eliminating the zippered pockets on the chest and inside. These just don’t get used by kids of the age 3 to 5 and add unnecessary material and costs to the garment. On the other hand, great are the reflective details on the jacket - though there could be possibly be some more, especially on the right sleeve there could also be a patch like on the left one. As for the freedom of movement, the Mamid was great for all our activities, from sledding to walking and climbing on rocks. The material is durable and abrasion-resistant and still looked like new after a season in the snow.</p>

<p>In short, if he’d not out-grown it so quickly he’d still be wearing it - also because he really liked his red winter jacket! Good thing his little sister will be able to wear it in a year or two and then I can go sledding with her =) The <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Koululaisten-lastenvaatteet/Ulkovaatteet/Ulkotakit/Talvitakit/Lasten-Reimatec®%2B--talvitakki-Serkku/p/531235-3830">Reimatec Serkku Winter Jacket</a> is the successor to the Mamid Jacket so if you’re still looking for a warm, durable and stylish jacket for your little one - we can recommend this one completely!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16889011560/in/album-72157651506091295/" title="Pyhä Sled Hill"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7713/16889011560_3351fc57fa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Pyhä Sled Hill" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That brings us to the pants which we got together with the jacket, the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Syysuutuudet/Lasten-toppahousut-Procyon/p/522207N-6980">Procyon pants</a>. These are also well-constructed, robust and still look very good after a winter season of abuse. While the suspenders are a bit tricky when our son was supposed to dress up himself, they ensured the pants stayed where they belong when we were outside, and the small bib added also a wee bit of warmth. There could have been some more reflective details on them (there are, but not enough in my opinion) as especially now in November it is so dark and more visibility is always good.</p>

<p>The pants have great freedom of movement, climbing and running in them was no problem, and the taped seams made them highly water-repellant and windproof. The stretchy inside trouser cuffs ensured no snow came into his boots and socks and are adjustable in width - together with the Velcro adjusters on the outside trouser legs these mean no snow or dirt has a chance. The two side pockets were again never used and could be eliminated, but otherwise these were great, warm pants when playing in the snow.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30201863854/in/dateposted/" title="Stay here!"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5346/30201863854_580e6c896f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Stay here!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Overall we were very happy with the two winter garments from Reima (and the many other ones we have bought!) and it is great to support &amp; work together with a Finnish Company which makes so good clothes for kids. Winter is arriving all over Europe, so now is a good time to get those warm, durable and stylish kids garments so the little ones can continue to play outside. <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/marken/reima/?pid=10239">Bergfreunde</a> have a wide selection of Reima garments, and you also can buy everything directly at the <a href="https://www.reima.com/">Reima Online Shop</a> or visit a <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/myymalat">local Reima Retailer</a>.</p>
