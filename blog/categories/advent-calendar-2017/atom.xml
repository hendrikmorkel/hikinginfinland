<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>what does every outdoor enthusiast need? Right: Pants. The <a href="http://www.lundhags.com/Products/Clothing/Pants/Stretch-Hybrid-Pants/Makke-Pant/(color)/290#info">Makke Pants</a> from Lundhags is exactly such a pants - they are light, has pre-shaped knees for freedom of movement and ventilation openings to stay cool, enough pockets to store the map &amp; compass and looks really great, too! Made from Lundhags PolyCotton Stretch material with Schoeller Dry Skin stretch panels on the seat it is durable and sheds light rain but is stretchy enough to allow for scrambles in the hills. Add a thin Merino baselayer under it and you even can wear it during mild winter hikes!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>you know what is more exciting than skiing, hiking and climbing? Right, documenting these pursuits when you are outdoors! Sadly storing and transporting your gear with the leashes and pockets which come with cameras aren’t always the best - if you want those, you will need to stop by at Peak Design. This company from San Fransisco has been designing and manufacturing some of the best accessories for photographers out there, and with their new <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/product/bags/everyday-sling-5/?acc=97">Everyday Sling 5L</a> they now also offer such a compact pouch that it fits my a6500 and some equipment just perfectly! I also prefer to use the <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/product/straps/leash/?acc=97">Leash</a> instead of the camera straps which come with my cameras, as the Leash is easy to take off when not needed (when e.g. using a slider) - or you can add the <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/product/straps/cuff/?acc=97">Cuff</a> if you want to secure your camera to just your hand. This lightweight trio of Everyday Sling, Leash and Cuff is the ideal companion to any small DSLR or M43 Camera, and hence I’d love to add it to my camera kit!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>picture this: You arrive up North for your trip and you realize your quilt isn’t up to the task of keeping you toasty. Staying warm in subzero temperatures isn’t easy, but happily the <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/foratata-quilt/">Foratata Quilt</a> from the Spanish Cottage As Tucas would do just that! Available in three styles and made with the high craftsmanship you know from them, the Foratata uses 900 cuin down to keep one warm when stationary but also packs small when one is moving. It’s a great piece of gear and brand-new - so new, indeed, that it ain’t available until later in December and this is the best chance to get the first Foratata quilt ever!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>picture this: I was just yesterday in Slushy Helsinki, but travelling back north it got colder and whiter the further north we went. As I arrived in Vaasa and walked to my bicycle it was covered under a white blanket and I wished I would have had a warmer jacket with me - something like the <a href="http://www.mountain-equipment.de/moreno-jacket">Moreno Jacket</a> from Mountain Equipment. The Polartec Thermal Pro Fleece has this cuddly look and is just as at home on a trip to the office as it is ice-climbing in Korouoma. Two zippered pockets store the essentials when on the go in town or some snacks when climbing up a frozen waterfall. It’s so versatile in use that I’m even pondering getting the <a href="http://www.mountain-equipment.de/womens-moreno-jacket">female version</a> for my wife because she most certainly would love this warm fleece jacket!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>December is here! What better way to kick things of for the next 24 days than with a backpack? <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/?pid=10239">Alpinetrek.co.uk</a> was so kind to provide one lucky hiker with the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/berghaus-freeflow-30-trekking-backpack/?pid=10239">Berghaus Freeflow 30</a>. At 30 l it packs a lot of gear for a day out in the hills, and the ultralight backpacker will even take the pack outdoor a weekend trip or longer. The back panel is increasing airflow and should be great for sweaty summer hikes, while the included rain cover keeps the contents dry when the weather turns. Stretchy side pockets carry a water bottle while the stretchy front pocket takes in a jacket or other gear. All in all a sweet pack which is great for hillwalking and dayhikes!</p>
