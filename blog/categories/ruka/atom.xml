    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The skiing season 2019 isn‚Äôt over just yet - there‚Äôs still great snow to be shredded in the far North of Finland, as I experienced last weekend in Ruka.</p>

<p>As part of me trying to minimize my environmental footprint but unwilling to not ski I travelled last weekend by train and bus to Ruka-Kuusamo, some 500 kilometres from Vaasa away. Even with short stop-overs between switching from the train to the Bus it‚Äôs almost a 10 hour journey to get to Ruka, though as you can walk around in the train, there‚Äôs good internet and you can work there‚Äôs nothing to worry about. Though I was happy that I was able to get out on the hills once I arrived in Ruka, and with the lifts being open till 19 o‚Äôclock I got in a few hours of skiing on the slopes after a full day of travelling - not a bad start! And to make it even better, it had been snowing the whole Thursday and would continue throughout the night.</p>

<p>After the skiing I went to have Dinner at <a href="https://ruokburger.fi">RUOK Burger</a> which is just next door from my apartment in the <a href="https://www.ski-inn.fi/en/majoitus/ruka">Ruka Village Ski-Inn</a>. Their Portobello Burger was the only vegetarian option and super-tasty, and I accompanied it with a local Craft Beer from Rovaniemi, a nice Amber Lager. After that I retired to my cozy apartment, heated up the Sauna and watched how it was snowing outside. Being on ski holidays it is always great to watch it snow ‚ùÑÔ∏è as that means fresh powder the next day when you‚Äôre outside on the hills!</p>

<p>The next morning a bright blue sky woke me up, and all signs were on an amazing day on and off the slopes. There‚Äôs just something great about hitting the slopes and being one of the first ones there. I love painting my curves into the still un-shredded corduroy, and then Veera and me went into the side-country to look for some powder. And powder we found.</p>

<p>It really feels amazing to surf through the fluffy snow and throw up big swoops of the white gold. Veera and me both had big smiles on our faces after cruising through the powder-filled forests, so once it was noon we went to <a href="http://www.hankibaari.fi">Hanki Baari</a> for lunch, where I ate a tasty vegan Mie Goreng. Hanki Baari is either way an amazing place to chill after a day on the slopes, listening to music and drinking some fancy beers, though right now we just needed some good nutrition before hitting the slopes again.</p>

<p>So, after a coffee ‚òïÔ∏è it was time to go ride some more. After all, the sun was shining, the slopes were in prime condition and the lifts would be running till 23 o‚Äôclock (Fridays the Ruka Ski Resort‚Äôs lifts run so late because those who journey after work to Ruka still can hit the illuminated slopes!). However, we wouldn‚Äôt ski that long, as we had another plan.</p>

<p>We went on a little powder hunt with friends of Veera, which resulted in a short but exhausting climb through hip-deep snow back to the slopes from the lake ü§£ After that I went for a few more laps on the slopes before calling it a day. A quick shower later I was sitting in the <a href="https://www.pizzeriaruka.fi/en/">Pizzeria Ruka</a> which is probably the best Pizza you can get in Ruka. It‚Äôs a five minute stroll from the centre of the village to the Pizzeria, and their wood-fired oven served me in no time a delicious Tartufo Pizza. That‚Äôs exactly what I needed after almost six hours of skiing, and gave me enough energy for the hike we had planned for the evening.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://www.hendrikmorkel.com">photographer</a> I hate it to spend a gorgeous sunset inside, so I was happy that Veera and her dog were up for a sunset mission to Konttainen, a hill some 10 minutes away from Ruka. A steep 11 minute climb later we were on the top of Konttainen, and strolled towards the best spot in the house while the show was just starting. It‚Äôs soooooo much better to be outside in nature when the sun sets than sitting inside, and this definitely was an evening well spent. After the sun disappeared from view we gazed for a while onto the illuminated slopes of Ruka, and for a moment I was tempted to jump back into my <a href="http://bit.ly/2D2JtFL">ski boots</a> and go for some night skiing. But then I remembered my warm Sauna and the cold beer which were waiting for me, so I skipped the night skiing and relaxed in my apartment before calling it a night.</p>

<p>The next morning white clouds hung over the mountain and gave the slopes and village a sci-fi feel. I‚Äôs the kind of weather where you ponder if you should just stay inside and chill-lax, but as I wanted to get my skis on that didn‚Äôt happen and early on Saturday morning Veera and me where again on the slopes, searching for some untracked pockets of powder.</p>

<p>And slowly but surely the sun was burning through the clouds and as the day progressed the views came out again, and we also were lucky by finding some fine lines of untouched powder not far from the hustle and bustle of the slopes.</p>

<p>After all that off-piste skiing it was time to join the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/ski-pride">Ruka Ski Pride</a> Parade. I really ‚ù§Ô∏è that Ruka has this event which celebrates equal rites and diversity on the slopes, and the vibe was so positive and fun - I really enjoyed to be part of it üåà Besides this parade there were inclusive events the whole weekend, with concerts and DJs, and of course some good skiing!</p>

<p>And then the day was almost over again. But not before I skied one final time from the East to the West, and from the North to the South across the whole resort. I love to ski fast and go from one end of a resort to the other one, shredding down the slopes and throwing up clouds of slushy spring snow, and at the end of this Saturday my trusty <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/suunto-spartan-ultra-black-multifunktionsuhr/?pid=10239">Suunto Spartan Ultra</a> told me I had skied almost 50 km of distance this day, and I could tell by how my legs felt.</p>

<p>After some relaxing I met Mats for Dinner at <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/villisika">Villisika</a> from where you have the best view over the slopes, so while we were eating we could see how the snow groomers got the hill ready for the next day. Sadly, the next sunny day I wouldn‚Äôt be shredding the groomers, as I was sitting in the train and bus back south. But I have a feeling that I will travel North once more for more skiing before the winter truly ends ‚ùÑÔ∏è</p>

<h2 id="spring-skiing-in-ruka">Spring Skiing in Ruka</h2>

<p>As you can see above, winter isn‚Äôt over just yet in Finnish Lapland, even if it may feel like it here in the south where most of the snow is already gone. Until early May there‚Äôs plenty of great skiing to be had in Northern Finland, and if you‚Äôre like me and can not get enough of skiing and winter then you too should steal away for a weekend to Ruka for some spring skiing. The slopes in <a href="https://www.ruka.fi">Ruka</a> are open till early May, and between now and the closing of the slopes there‚Äôs every weekend a weekend of fun to be had: Next weekend, from the 11.4. - 14.4.2019 is the legendary <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/spring-break">Ruka Spring Break</a> which will enlighten those who like to Party between hitting the groomers. The <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/easter">Easter Weekend</a> has winter activities for the whole family on offer, and the first of May is the traditional <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/wappulounas">Wappulounas</a>, a get-together of the international snowboard community on the slopes of Ruka. So don‚Äôt ponder longer - go and get some of that spring snow!</p>

<h2 id="where-to-stay">Where to Stay</h2>

<p>I stayed at the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/rukasuites">Ski Inn</a> and liked my apartment in the centre of the village. It was a two minute stroll to the Gondola and lift, a one minute walk to the supermarket, and Hanki Baari was even in the same building so I didn‚Äôt had to go far for a beer! There‚Äôs plenty more <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/where-to-stay">places to stay in Ruka</a> for any budget, and if you‚Äôre pondering where to eat: Just follow my recommendations above or try any of the other restaurants in the village and it‚Äôs surroundings.</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-ruka">Getting to Ruka</h2>

<p>The most convenient way is to take the <a href="http://vr.fi">train</a> and <a href="https://matkahuolto.fi">bus</a> to Ruka, or if you come from abroad you can fly to the <a href="https://www.finavia.fi/en/airports/kuusamo">Kuusamo Airport</a> and take the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/getting-around">Ski Bus</a> to Ruka. On the train you can sleep, work and walk around, and during the bus trip you can enjoy the beautiful Finnish landscape while listening to your favourite tunes.</p>

<h2 id="skiing-in-the-dark">Skiing in the Dark</h2>

<p>Have you ever skied after sunset? And I don‚Äôt mean alpine starts skinning up a mountain, but skiing after the sun has set and darkness has fallen across the land? Not? Then welcome to skiing in Finland in the depth of winter!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34026818781/in/album-72157677820371241/" title="Up"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2934/34026818781_6cc2c615ab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Up" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With the sun and it‚Äôs light being rare guests between December and February up here in the North you will very likely be skiing at night when you‚Äôre visiting. But in case that sounds scary √° la <em>‚ÄúSkiing without seeing anything‚Äù</em> you can be assured that you‚Äôll see plenty when you‚Äôre hitting the slopes in Ruka in January. The slopes are lit and even if you leave the slope to enjoy a wee bit of powder between the trees you will still see everything. The whole Rukatunturi hill is illuminated as along as the lifts run, and skiing in the light while the world around you is covered in a blanket of black darkness is amazing. David, Nathaniel and me stood several times at the top of the slopes and just being speechless about this experience.</p>

<h2 id="floating-on-an-ice-cold-river">Floating on an ice-cold river</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs -10¬∞C and we‚Äôre putting on dry suits, all over our winter clothes. Everything except our faces are covered in an orange suit and neoprene. Then it‚Äôs a short ride to the river and a walk up to the lake, where the stream starts.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/33315033524/in/album-72157677820371241/" title="Floating"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2812/33315033524_54fe01e4dc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="767" alt="Floating" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Our Guide from <a href="https://www.rukapalvelu.fi/en/activities/winter/floating-in-the-rapids/150-floating-in-the-rapids">Ruka Palvelu</a> gives us some last explanations of what to consider when we‚Äôre soon walking into the current which will carry us gently but swiftly down the river. Everything is covered in snow along the shore, and an elk which was drinking from the open river looks full of wonder upon our small group of floating humans. Too quickly we reach the small bay where we need to get out of the river - but happily we have a second float before us! We hike once more up to the lake, walking in till the chest and then just let the buoyancy of the suit carry us down the stream.</p>

<h2 id="ice-climbing">Ice-climbing</h2>

<p>I love <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/ice-climbing-in-korouoma.html">ice climbing</a> and hence was psyched that this activity was on our programme. We went ice climbing with <a href="http://www.outdoorpassion.fi/en/winter/ice-climbing">Outdoor Passion</a> who operate and maintain the Kuru ice wall which is located a ten minutes walk up the slopes from Ruka village. The routes were in good conditions and ranged from beginner to advanced and I had a blast whacking my ice tools into the fine ice, enjoying the good views from further up and of course also seeing that my group enjoyed this activity a lot!</p>

<h2 id="winter-hiking-on-the-karhunkierros">Winter-hiking on the Karhunkierros</h2>

<p>I have hiked several times and in every season on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2009/06/karhunkierros-i.html">Karhunkierros</a>, but experiencing it in winter is always special.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34000243432/in/album-72157677820371241/" title="Tara crossing the river"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2941/34000243432_fac25cd1ce_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tara crossing the river" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This was a short hike to Myllykoski which lays along the Karhunkierros and is one of the most popular (Instagram) places along the trail. The rapids next to the all mill with the hanging bridge across the rapids is impressive, and even in the depth of winter you most likely won‚Äôt need snowshoes as there‚Äôs a wide trail through the forest to Myllykoski. Once you‚Äôre there you could light up a fire and enjoy some coffee and marshmallows by the fire, or continue exploring the area.</p>

<p>Ruka has <a href="http://www.ruka.fi/en/restaurants">variety of Restaurants</a> which means you can try something new each evening during your stay. From cozy slope side Caf√©s to fine-dining experiences, there‚Äôs something for every taste.</p>

<p>We ate at various places while up in the North and instead of me telling you where to go I‚Äôd encourage you to go and explore yourself (OK, we had a fantastic lunch at Hotel Cumulus Resort Rukahovi, another tasty lunch Buffet was enjoyed at Restaurant Rukan Kuksa, we drunk local beers at <a href="http://www.hankibaari.fi">Hanki Baari</a> and had a Chef cook for us in the Kota above).</p>

<h2 id="ice-sauna-yoga">(Ice) Sauna (Yoga)</h2>

<p>How do you end a day of adventure in Finland in winter? Right, by relaxing &amp; warming up in a Sauna.</p>

<p>On our 2nd day in Ruka we went for the <a href="http://wellbeinginwilderness.fi/en/saunatour/">Sauna Tour</a>. It started off with a very nice Sauna Yoga Session. The Sauna was only 50¬∞C warm and we learned simple Yoga poses which helped to release tension from the day.</p>

<p>After that we went for a short ride to the <a href="http://wellbeinginwilderness.fi/en/slow-silent/the-ice-sauna-and-healing-peat-sauna/">Ice Sauna</a> which was truly unique and had a very nice l√∂yly (steam). Sitting inside of a building that‚Äôs made from ice blocks and having a hot stove warm it up is something to be experienced, and I highly recommend trying it out if you‚Äôre in Ruka. After the ice sauna we went into the traditional <a href="http://www.rukansalonki.fi/en/saunas">Smoke Sauna</a> and had a peat mask, again a truly uniquely Finnish experience which is well worth trying. After these Sauna experiences we went for a swim in the ice hole in Lake Salonkij√§rvi, and had light snacks and plenty of water to stay hydrated.</p>

<h2 id="getting--staying-there">Getting &amp; Staying There</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.finnair.com">Finnair</a> flies from Helsinki to Kuusamo from where you can take the bus to Ruka. Before heading to Ruka we stayed for a night at the <a href="http://www.ikk.fi/en/">Isokenk√§isten Klubi</a>, a very nice Hotel which was almost in the middle of nowhere close to the Russian Border. They have a fantastic Smoke Sauna which we enjoyed and great food, so are well worth a visit. There‚Äôs also lots of XC skiing and ice fishing around the Hotel, so if you look a more calm stay consider the Isokenk√§isten Klubi (it‚Äôs not a Club, despite the name =).</p>

<p>In Ruka our group stayed at the <a href="https://www.ski-inn.fi/en/majoitus/ruka">Ruka Ski-Inn</a> and we had a nice room, though I found the breakfast left more to be desired. We checked out the <a href="https://www.cumulus.fi/hotellit/rukatunturi/cumulus-resort-rukahovi-rukatunturi">Cumulus Resort Rukahovi</a> next door and that looked pretty neat - no idea on the breakfast, though we had a very tasty lunch there! There‚Äôs <a href="http://www.ruka.fi/en/hotels">six more Hotels in Ruka</a> and you also can <a href="http://www.ruka.fi/en/cottages">rent a cottage</a> or an <a href="http://www.ruka.fi/en/apartments">apartment</a> in the village.</p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that a winter vacation in Ruka can be as relaxing or adventurous as you‚Äôd like it to be. There‚Äôs great accommodation options, delicious food, good local beers and a host of activities of every flavour to make your time in Ruka special. While all we did was a wee bit much in just two days if you spread this out over a week with more skiing - because with over 30 slopes and 20 lifts there‚Äôs plenty of skiing for all levels to be enjoyed in Ruka!</p>
