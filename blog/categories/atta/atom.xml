I was able to escape to this beautiful island in early December and enjoyed the hospitality, sunshine and beautiful nature.</p>

<p>Meeting with friends and going on adventures with them is the best thing ever. Good thing I was on this trip on Cyprus with friends old and new, and that together we experienced all the wonderful things Cyprus has to offer - from great hikes to climbing and diving, delicious food which is plentiful and of course the friendly &amp; kind Cypriots who were excited to show us the beauty of their island. Here’s a taster of what we saw on this island  - more to come later this month!</p>

<p>And more beautiful hikes - Cyprus has a lot to offer to the outdoor enthusiast who needs sunshine and warmth in December. There’s a long-distance trail running across the island, as well as hundreds of longer and shorter trails, dozens of climbing crags and even Downhill MTB trails, though road biking is a lot more popular. I’ll tell you more about the possibilities of this small island later this month, so maybe follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikmorkel/">Instagram</a> to not miss any updates!</p>

<p>As usual this is just a photographic feast of my most recent trip, to get you in the mood for planning a visit to Switzerland. I will follow it up with more in-depth articles of the visit, and show you what kind of great hikes and adventures you can have in the Ticino, Andermatt, Valais and Interlaken areas! Lets start in Ticino - the sunny southern part of Switzerland, where Italian is spoken by a majority and you find an Mediterranean environment and usually lots of sun - unless you have a bit of no-luck with the weather, and it’s raining the whole time! Nevertheless, that’s not a problem for us outdoor people - <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/200-g-hardshell-montane-podium-pull-on-and-pants.html">hardshell on</a> and outside!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51704797252/in/album-72157720231166005/" title="Cloudy"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51704797252_c59f0c9700_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cloudy" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Truth be told, after some rainy days in Bellinzona, Locarno and the Maggia Valley I also experienced an absolutely beautiful morning in the Balvona Valley, where we hiked through many picturesque villages before taking the Postbus and local trains back to Bellinzona.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51704814432/in/album-72157720231166005/" title="Cascata di Foroglio"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51704814432_d1574cbbbf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="682" alt="Cascata di Foroglio" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The visit to Andermatt also started off wet, with plenty of rain, and continued the next day with climbing a Via Ferrata in the rain and mist, before exploring a “Cairngorn-esque” Valley (that’s what it looked like in the clouds 😆) on some sweet eMTBs with Jessie and Fredrik. Our final day in Andermatt we got to see the small village in the sun, and it looked fantastic, to say the least!</p>

<p>On this trip we only used public transportation, so the fantastic Swiss trains - punctual, clean, and a joy to ride in. Especially in the Glacier Express with it’s large windows!</p>

<p>In love I felt with Saas-Fee and it’s amazing views - add in that this is a car-free village, and I am considering moving there! We arrived there in the evening by Postbus, and then had something very typical Swiss: Raclette 🧀!</p>

<p>The Postbus took us to Leukerbad, another small village with impressive views, as it is surrounded by 900 m high rock walls. Here you can find Thermal Springs and the longest Via Ferrata of the Alps.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51706294924/in/album-72157720231166005/" title="Morning in Leukerbad"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51706294924_a3b53dbae2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Morning in Leukerbad" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A beautiful morning hike took us up the Gemmipass and to Sunnbüel in the Canton of Bern. Here we continued our trip via Kandersteg, an ice-climbing Mecca in winter, to Interlaken. In this pretty town you can experience various kinds of adventurous activities, from Paragliding to Kayaking and Bungee-Jumping, or simply make a trip up the Jungfraujoch!</p>
