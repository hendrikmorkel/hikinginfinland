    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ask a Swede about √Öre and they will know: This is the place to be in the summer for Downhill biking, hiking, kayaking and many more outdoor activities, while in the winter this small village with it‚Äôs cozy Caf√©s, outdoor shops and restaurants becomes a bit bigger as people come to ski on √Öreskutan and the surrounding mountains. I spent the last week in √Öre and V√•l√•dalen enjoying the Swedish nature &amp; hospitality - here is what you can expect!</p>

<p>I travelled via Ferry and train to √Öre, which is very easy but it takes some time. A good book, your favourite Youtube show and naps will make the time go by fast, and before you know it you‚Äôll be in √Öre, not far away from the border with Norway. You‚Äôll get the full information on how to get there, where to stay and what to eat soon, for the moment just enjoy these images and short tidbits about my autumn week in √Öre and V√•l√•dalen üçÇ</p>

<p>On my first day in √Öre I went hiking, trailrunning and explored the little village. Even in the off-season that is now there were plenty of people out on the mountain and in the village, and after some rain throughout the day it cleared up and became a nice evening with a spectacular sunset.</p>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/06/the-ul-fellowship.html">Eight years ago I have been in V√•l√•dalen</a> (<em>and go read that article it‚Äôs still AMAZING!</em>) and I was excited to go back. Heck, to be honest, I want to go back there right now. The autumn colours were on point, the bilberries sweet and big, and the scenery just sublime. A detailed article only about the backpacking trip comes soon so stay tuned for that, too.</p>

<p>After 92 amazing kilometres of backpacking it was back to √Öre and doing something which I have never done before: Downhill Mountain Biking. A sport I had &amp; still have a massive amount respect for, and was scared of. But with my Guide Jesper I became confident and had so much fun ripping down the trails, taking these high turns, learning to jump (still learning üòÇ) and feeling confident on these narrow trails. Wow, that was soooo good.</p>

<p>There was great vegan food, tasty local beers, delicious crepes &amp; coffee, lots of bilberries, great views and friendly people.</p>
