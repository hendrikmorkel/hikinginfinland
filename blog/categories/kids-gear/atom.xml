<p>Like most parents we think our two kids are active and enough outside, but a real way of measuring this assumption we did not have - until around three weeks ago. Then the ReimaGo Sensor and some compatible garments arrived at the Hiking in Finland HQ - and then there was just one thing to do: Install the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/fi/app/reimago/id1083484265?mt=8">ReimaGo App</a>, plug the <a href="https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1173541864&amp;as=1179503632&amp;t=2&amp;tk=1&amp;url=https://www.reima.com/fi/ReimaGO/ReimaGO%C2%AE-sensori/p/599160-9990">ReimaGo Sensor</a> in the <a href="https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1173541864&amp;as=1179503632&amp;t=2&amp;tk=1&amp;url=https://www.reima.com/fi/Koululaisten-lastenvaatteet/Ulkovaatteet/Ulkotakit/ReimaGO%C2%AE-softshell-takki-Hatch/p/531263-8800">ReimaGo softshell jacket</a> and… live life normally. We don’t own a car and go everywhere by bike or on foot, and so do our kids - so for us we wanted to see if during our normal, regular days our kids get enough outdoor exercise time or if we need to add more outdoor time to our schedule.</p>

<h2 id="the-reimago-sensor">The ReimaGo Sensor</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1173541864&amp;as=1179503632&amp;t=2&amp;tk=1&amp;url=https://www.reima.com/fi/ReimaGO/ReimaGO%C2%AE-sensori/p/599160-9990">ReimaGo Sensor</a> has been developed together with Suunto, another Finnish company which you might know from their high-quality wrist watches. The sensor makes use of Suunto’s Movesense technology. It’s a durable little button design that is waterproof to 30 m and attaches to compatible garments - either drop it into a small pocket or attach it to the designated place (see the underneath photo). The ideas is to use the sensor only outdoors - at least thus far the garments that the sensor connects with are all outdoor garments. This isn’t good news for kids who train e.g. indoor sports, but then nothing really stops you to put the ReimaGo Sensor just into a pocket when your child trains indoors. Maybe this is the next line of ReimaGo garments the company will launch - and with the OutDoor just a short four weeks away we probably know more soon!</p>

<h2 id="the-reimago-app">The ReimaGo App</h2>

<p>The ReimaGo App turns the tracked data into a <em>“game”</em> that sets challenges and rewards children for their efforts. The game is less PokemonGo and more just that the child is collecting through its outdoor activities <em>energy</em> which lets it move its avatar through the various levels. All there is to the game is the pushing of a button to use the collected energy to move forward, and if you finish a level there’s a short animation and you get a digital Award for the finished level. After not even three weeks our son is already in Level 7 and there’s only 15 Levels, so I reckon that some time in June we will be done - unless there’s an update which adds more levels.</p>

<p>Besides the <em>Kids side</em> of the ReimaGo App there’s also a parents side. Here you can add rewards for time spent outdoors - like an ice cream after five hours outdoors, or you can take a photo of a reward you create yourself (<a href="http://amzn.to/2qvLo06">LEGO Ninjago</a> is very popular here right now and thus makes for a great incentive to play outdoors!). This we find a good way to keep the child interested in the app - though truth be told, our son still loves to check each evening his energy of the day and his eyes go big when he sees how much time he has spent outdoors!</p>

<p>At the beginning you set a daily target of outdoor time, and we started out with the recommended 1 hour per day (= 7 hours a week). In his first week our son was triple that outdoors, so now we have raised the time to 90 minutes daily. The length of the Levels corresponds to the daily amount set; to keep these times realistic makes for a better experience for the kids, so don’t go offer the top! We also added our first reward - going to eat an ice cream - so are looking forward to see his surprise when he gets this reward!</p>

<h2 id="the-experience">The Experience</h2>

<p>We really like the whole ReimaGo experience. The ReimaGo garments - we got a pants and a jacket - are as high-quality as we are used to from Reima, and our son also likes to wear them. Easy to use, easy to clean, good fit and great freedom of movement - in short, a great jacket and pants.</p>

<p>The Sensor and App are easy to set up and use - from adding the child’s account to the app over playing the game to adding rewards - and are well made with a pleasing design for kids and adults alike. The levels are different enough to keep it exciting, and the best thing obviously is that it really makes our son want to go play outdoors so that he can collect energy. Every evening after dinner we get the sensor, open tha ReimaGo app and then see how active he was today. He then uses his collected energy to move through the level and is might proud when he has finished it - looking forward to the next day!</p>

<p>Finally, what we also like is that with the App you can add multiple kids - each with their own sensor - to it and so can keep an eye on the whole tribe’s activity. And if you yourself don’t have a fitness tracker yet, obviously nothing could stop you to get a ReimaGo Sensor for yourself to see how active you are =)</p>

<h2 id="the-bottomline">The Bottomline</h2>

<p>We were sceptical if we needed an activity monitor for our son - we felt he’s plenty outside, plus attaching a sensor to our child already felt a wee bit like trying to control him. But as the Sensor really only tracks his movement and time spent outside this concern was unfounded. The ReimaGo sensor is also more child-friendly than many other fitness trackers for kids on the market as it is easy to use, affordable and durable. That the sensor is hidden in the jacket or pants also makes it less intrusive than a wristband, and the gamification of the outdoor activity makes the whole go-out-and-play idea very appealing for the small kids, in comparison to a chart of numbers which normal fitness trackers give you. It has allowed us to see how active our child is (on average 2+ hours a day, so well above what the World Health Organization recommends) and encourage him to play outdoors - even if the weather isn’t sunshine and blue sky.</p>

<p>Overall we can recommend the ReimaGo sensor if you’d like to encourage your child to go play outside or would like to find out how much time she spends outdoors. The Rewards which you can add for your child in the App - from an ice cream, a camping trip or another present - help motivate kids to go play outside and keep them interested in the App. Ultimately I feel this helps us to motivate our kids for longer hikes, bike rides and backpacking trips, and spend more quality-family-outdoor-time together =)</p>

And as it just dumped some 30 cm of snow and the winter holidays start here in Pohjanmaa it is time to shed some light on the Reimatec Stavanger Overall and why we love it!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/33103187776/in/photostream/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/622/33103187776_efcc9a0c04_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Last December the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Lasten-ulkovaatteet/Lasten-haalarit-ja-setit/Lasten-Reimatec®%2B-toppahaalari-Stavanger/p/520190F-8430">Reimatec Stavanger Overall</a> arrived at the Hiking in Finland HQ and was immediately declared awesome by our son and very relieved parents (because they in a moment no longer needed to help dressing him up =). To understand this one needs to know that our son always needed a little assistance when he needed to put on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/11/winter-fun-with-the-reima-mamid-jacket-and-procyon-pants.html">Jacket and Pants</a> when it was time to go out. While he could put them on himself he prefrred to that mom or dad help him get dressed for the cold. As we have a one year old who can’t yet dress herself up this meant we were at once dressing up two kids, plus ourselves, before we could go out. This can get tedious to say the least, so when we saw that he was happy to put on the overall (in less than a minute, including <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Asusteet/Pipot-ja-hatut/c/k61">hat</a>, <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/brands/buff/for--kids/?pid=10239">Buff</a> and the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Asusteet/Hanskat-ja-rukkaset/Talvirukkaset-ja--hanskat/c/k63">Reimatec Suunta mitts</a>) we were very happy parents indeed!</p>

<p>So, now the kid has dressed himself up to go out into the cold, but how does the overall stand up to the use &amp; abuse a 5 year old can throw at it? Very well, we’d say. We were ice skating, building igloos, climbing on rocks, had running competitions and played hide &amp; seek, in temperatures from 0°C to -20°C. The waterproof &amp; breathable outer shell material has taken all these activities in stride and hasn’t failed us yet, keeping wind, snow and wetness at bay. It’s pretty durable, too - climbing on rocks with the knees and then sliding them back down hasn’t done any damage to the material.</p>

<p>It’s easy to clean, too - just throw it into the washing machine (add a suitable <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/toko-eco-softshell-wash-250-ml-detergent/?pid=10239">detergent</a>) at 40°C and an hour later you can hang it up to dry. Because of the insulation it needs around 12 to 16 hours to thoroughly dry, so keep that in mind.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32329153543/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2937/32329153543_c4ea0971cb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Warmth-wise the overall is toasty and is sufficient on its own up to temperatures of -5°C with our son. When it gets colder than -5°C we add a <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Koululaisten-lastenvaatteet/Lasten-lämpökerrastot/Yläosat/Lasten-fleecetakki-Frans/p/536097-3710">fleece jacket</a> and <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Lasten-sisävaatteet/Alaosat/Lasten-fleecehousut-Argelius/p/526243-6980">fleece pants</a> underneath the overall, and that’s no problem as there’s room to spare without restricting movement. Speaking of movement, snow angles, climbing on rocks and at the play ground, skiing and ice skating all were easy to do as the overall does not restrict the freedom of movement.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32761950190/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/601/32761950190_525fece769_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Also otherwise we really like the Stavanger Overall: The inside suspenders are great when dressing up and in breaks as our son can undress the overall but with the suspenders still over his shoulders he’s able to walk around without that the top is hanging on the floor. The width of the overall can be adjusted via two inside elastics, making it as wide or narrow as you need it. There’s only two pockets on it which is just the right amount, and the insulated hood with a fur collar can be removed (the fake fur, too). The leg cuffs can also be adjusted in width, while the elastic cuffs keep wind and snow from getting into the sleeves. The reflective details are easy to overlook, but there’s plenty of them, from top to bottom, which makes the wearer very visible on these dark winter nights and morning.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32761950830/in/dateposted/" title="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/746/32761950830_918aa8078a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reimatec®+ Stavanger Overall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Some words on the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Koululaisten-lastenvaatteet/Asusteet/Hanskat-ja-rukkaset/Lasten-Reimatec®%2B--topparukkaset-Suunta/p/527252-9990">Reimatec Suunta mitts</a>, too. We got these at the same time than the overall but they haven’t been used as much - simply because it was way too warm for them most of this <em>“winter”</em>. Now that the thermometer has shown beautiful double digit minus degrees it was time to put them on, and for playing in the snow and walking to the kindergarden or to town these were great to keep the little hands warm. These mitts have a very warm fleece lining and a snug cuff which goes high, and they’re best from temperatures over -10°C in our experience. Anything above that and our son would run very hot &amp; sweaty in them. Because they’re so long it’s best to put the gloves on before the overall, this is simpler. There’s some help needed to get the hands in the gloves through the elastic cuffs of the overall, but compared with dressing a kid up completely it’s a minor thing!</p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that with the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Lastenvaatteet/Lasten-ulkovaatteet/Lasten-haalarit-ja-setit/Lasten-Reimatec®%2B-toppahaalari-Stavanger/p/520190F-8430">Reimatec Stavanger Overall</a> we have a happy son that can dress up alone at home &amp; in the kindergarden, allows him to play outside in the cold winter weather, be visible in the mornings and evenings when it gets dark, and it is easy to undress when going inside for a hot chocolate! A happy son of course means also happy parents, so the Stavanger gets from us six thumbs up! It’s a very durable and well-designed kids overall and we just hope our daughter will be fine with the green colour once she is big enough to wear it in some three years =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30201863754/in/dateposted/" title="Up the Sled Hill"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5734/30201863754_12a9f5a583_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Up the Sled Hill" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Reima Mamid Jacket and Procyon Pants have been our choice of winter garments for our son, and this down-filled jacket and the warm and water-repellant pants have been great in keeping our little boy warm when the temperatures drop low. And low were the temperatures, not just here in Vaasa but also up North in Lapland on our <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/winter-family-adventures-in-pyha-luosto.html">Family winter holiday in Pyhä</a> - which is a great place to take your kids for a relaxed &amp; adventurous winter holiday!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17075087012/in/album-72157651506091295/" title="That one next, dad!"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7599/17075087012_e945efd6da_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="That one next, dad!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Mamid jacket has everything you’d expect of your own jacket: Taped seams, windproof, water-proof and a toasty warm insulation of Reima 60 Down (that means there’s a mix of 60% Down to 40% feathers, which I found a good combination as when our son is a lot less careful when he is out playing, and the high feather percentage means the down can do its job and does not get compressed to easily). The hood with the fake fur is great when standing on a cold fjell top or at night when watching the stars and Northern Lights. It can be removed when not needed, which is useful for those chilly but sunny autumn and spring days. The waist can be adjusted by a drawstring on the inside so it is close to the body, and the sleeves have Velcro cuffs so no cold breeze or snow come in.</p>

<p>I don’t know what is the obsession with pockets on Kids garments, maybe the manufacturers just adapt adult designs and make them smaller? At least I feel that most <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/kids-gear/">Kids garments</a> have too many pockets. The Mamid for example would have been fine with just the two large flap pockets, eliminating the zippered pockets on the chest and inside. These just don’t get used by kids of the age 3 to 5 and add unnecessary material and costs to the garment. On the other hand, great are the reflective details on the jacket - though there could be possibly be some more, especially on the right sleeve there could also be a patch like on the left one. As for the freedom of movement, the Mamid was great for all our activities, from sledding to walking and climbing on rocks. The material is durable and abrasion-resistant and still looked like new after a season in the snow.</p>

<p>In short, if he’d not out-grown it so quickly he’d still be wearing it - also because he really liked his red winter jacket! Good thing his little sister will be able to wear it in a year or two and then I can go sledding with her =) The <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Koululaisten-lastenvaatteet/Ulkovaatteet/Ulkotakit/Talvitakit/Lasten-Reimatec®%2B--talvitakki-Serkku/p/531235-3830">Reimatec Serkku Winter Jacket</a> is the successor to the Mamid Jacket so if you’re still looking for a warm, durable and stylish jacket for your little one - we can recommend this one completely!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16889011560/in/album-72157651506091295/" title="Pyhä Sled Hill"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7713/16889011560_3351fc57fa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Pyhä Sled Hill" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That brings us to the pants which we got together with the jacket, the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Syysuutuudet/Lasten-toppahousut-Procyon/p/522207N-6980">Procyon pants</a>. These are also well-constructed, robust and still look very good after a winter season of abuse. While the suspenders are a bit tricky when our son was supposed to dress up himself, they ensured the pants stayed where they belong when we were outside, and the small bib added also a wee bit of warmth. There could have been some more reflective details on them (there are, but not enough in my opinion) as especially now in November it is so dark and more visibility is always good.</p>

<p>The pants have great freedom of movement, climbing and running in them was no problem, and the taped seams made them highly water-repellant and windproof. The stretchy inside trouser cuffs ensured no snow came into his boots and socks and are adjustable in width - together with the Velcro adjusters on the outside trouser legs these mean no snow or dirt has a chance. The two side pockets were again never used and could be eliminated, but otherwise these were great, warm pants when playing in the snow.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30201863854/in/dateposted/" title="Stay here!"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5346/30201863854_580e6c896f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Stay here!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Overall we were very happy with the two winter garments from Reima (and the many other ones we have bought!) and it is great to support &amp; work together with a Finnish Company which makes so good clothes for kids. Winter is arriving all over Europe, so now is a good time to get those warm, durable and stylish kids garments so the little ones can continue to play outside. <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/marken/reima/?pid=10239">Bergfreunde</a> have a wide selection of Reima garments, and you also can buy everything directly at the <a href="https://www.reima.com/">Reima Online Shop</a> or visit a <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/myymalat">local Reima Retailer</a>.</p>

<p>Winter, also known to parents as the time where you need to get ready 15 minutes before you plan to leave - because your little ones need help dressing up in the multitude of layers we make them wear so they do not get cold. Because only when they’re not cold they actually enjoy being outdoors (much like adults, really). We tested the <a href="https://marmot.com/products/details/boys-space-walk-jacket">Marmot Space Walk Jacket</a> and <a href="https://marmot.com/products/details/boys-edge-insulated-pant">Edge Insulated Pants</a> during the last four months outside while alpine skiing, sledding, building snowmen and XC skiing, and here are our thoughts about them.</p>

<h2 id="space-walk-jacket">Space Walk Jacket</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.marmot.de/content/de/collection_26&amp;c=643&amp;show=5778">Space Walk Jacket</a> in Size XS equals size 110 and weighs 512 g. Our son loved the colour combination of orange and reds, and we too really liked it. Outside a waterproof &amp; breathable Marmot MemBrain® Fabric keeps snow and moisture at bay, while on the inside a Thermal R 100 g insulation ensures generated warmth stays inside. The hood is removable, and a really good fit, even over a bobble hat. The Powder Skirt keeps the snow out and is extremely useful for little skiers and playing in the snow. It has a silicone band on the inside which keeps it in place and has two levels of tightness. In the back, chin and neck a fleece lining makes it comfortable against the skin and likely helps with breathability, too. What we found overkill were the six pockets, we could have done easily with only the one large mesh pocket on the inside (which is great to store beanie, neck warmer and gloves!) and one of the outside pockets. Our son never used the Velcro hand pockets nor the other two pockets on the outside. The hem is adjustable, though with the toggles in the pockets it is difficult to do so - happily we never needed it. The sleeves have Velcro closures and also can be adjusted, and most importantly are wide enough so gloves can be worn underneath the sleeves to keep the snow out. The jacket closes high and our son found the area in the front of the face constricting, something we solved by leaving the zipper always a couple of centimetre open.</p>

<p>In terms of warmth, we feel the jacket (and pants for that matter) are warm till -10°C with a thin midlayer on (plus normal clothes), probably more with a thicker midlayer. The jacket has plenty of space underneath for layering, and our son never was cold in a variety of activities and weather conditions. It gives little skiers and climbers great freedom of movement, and the Powder Skirt ensures no cold and wet snow comes inside. After four months of use and a couple of washes the jacket also still looks like new, also at high-stress areas like the cuffs and back. Overall our son really liked his Space Walk Jacket - it is warm, has nice colours and is easy for him to put on and off on his own.</p>

<h2 id="edge-insulated-pants">Edge Insulated Pants</h2>

<p>In size XS the <a href="http://www.marmot.de/content/de/collection_26&amp;c=647&amp;show=5792">Edge Insulated Pants</a> weighs 444 g. They are, as the name suggests, insulated pants, made of the proprietary Marmot MemBrain® fabric on the outside which makes the pants water-resistant, while on the inside a Thermal R™ insulation keeps little winter lovers warm. We found the internal flex boot gaiters great to keep shoes &amp; socks dry from the inside, and the reinforced inside leg is useful for skiing as well as scrambling on rocks. The waist is adjustable via Velcros on the inside, but sadly the adjustment is only minimal - we feel a bit more adjustment in width or a stretchy waist could have been better and would possibly make it possible to use the pants two winter seasons. The removable suspenders are great, and the soft inside lining makes it easy to put the pants on over other pants. We never used the three pockets on the pants, so maybe it’d make sense to get rid of at least the two zippered pockets.</p>

<p>Putting the pants on is easy thanks to the smooth lining and it stays well in place with the adjustable suspenders and button closure. After four months of daily use outside the Edge Insulated Pants still looks like new after a couple of washes. The Marmot MemBrain® fabric kept the snow &amp; wetness always reliable outside and it was easy to brush dirt off the pants. They allow for great freedom of movement, be it scrambling up the snow hills along the streets, climbing on the playground or Alpine and XC skiing. The sizing is good for kids between 108 and 112 cm, though if your child is wearing more than one baselayer the waist might get tight (we just left the button open). Asides from these little things from us parents our son simply liked his Edge Insulated Pants a lot: They were toasty, allowed him to go sledding on his pants down steep snow hills and also looked cool!</p>
