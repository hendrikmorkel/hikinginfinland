<p>Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic we‚Äôre all mostly <em>‚Äústuck at home‚Äù</em> in our countries - which isn‚Äôt a bad thing at all, as this allows us to go explore where we live and pay taxes! This pandemic also has brought a lot of people into the outdoors, and obviously the first thing you should familiarize yourself with are the <a href="https://lnt.org">Leave No Trace principles</a> so you don‚Äôt <em>accidentally</em> leave your trash and poo somewhere where it does not belong - don‚Äôt be one of those jerks who throws trash into nature. Now that we have these essential rules out of the way, let me show you the gear you need when you go backpacking. The idea is to help you <strong>save money and only get what you REALLY need</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quick Definition! Hiking: The activity of walking in nature, but sleeping indoors. Backpacking: The activity of walking AND sleeping outdoors in nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="clothes">Clothes</h2>

<p>The Easiest and most difficult point right at the start. The easiest because I firmly believe that most people can go hiking in their normal sports clothes on their first trips. If you have a synthetic/ wind-resistant pants or shorts for running or sports, chances are these are fine for your first backpacking trip. Some things to keep in mind, though:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don‚Äôt wear jeans when backpacking. They are too warm, too heavy, stay wet forever if it rains, and are mostly uncomfortable and restrict your movement.</li>
  <li>Except on the hottest 30¬∞C or more days, don‚Äôt wear cotton shirts. Like jeans, they need too long to dry and if it gets cool don‚Äôt keep you warm.</li>
  <li>Avoid heavy ‚Äúhiking‚Äù boots, use trailrunning or sport shoes with a good, grippy sole instead.</li>
  <li>Invest into some good socks and underwear for hiking!</li>
  <li>You can take a (fleece) jogging pants, a comfy shirt and possibly some woolen socks for camp along</li>
</ul>

<p>It is very easy to spend thousands of ¬£$‚Ç¨ on clothes for hiking, and completely unnecessary for a beginner. Some sports clothes or airy fabric trousers with good freedom of movement and maybe some wind resistance are fine, together with a synthetic or Merino wool T-shirt. Most people own a fleece jacket, which works fine for insulation on summer days, and most also own a rain jacket. If you really want to start to invest into clothes for backpacking I‚Äôd recommend getting a good pair of light trailrunning shoes. Now, you won‚Äôt be running, but these types of shoes are comfortable all day long, you are unlikely to get blisters in them, they have great grip on muddy, wet and slippery terrain and they also are light. Go on a few day hikes before you take them backpacking, to see if they work for you. In 99% of the cases, they do üòä!</p>

<p><em>A detailed article on garments for hiking and backpacking will follow this month, so stay tuned if this topic interests you!</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7807588712/in/album-72157630936718764/" title="You can&#x27;t climb mountains in trailrunners"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7131/7807588712_df00e66139_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="You can&#x27;t climb mountains in trailrunners" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And finally, under clothes - <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/swix-pro-trail-carbon-120-trekking-pole.html">trekking poles</a>. Some people swear on them for hiking, others are happy without them. I both like them when I need them - for example when fording rivers, hiking through swamps, and demanding terrain, and I also am happy without them. Hence I like Poles which fold up small and are light, so that when I carry them they fits nicely to the side of the pack. If trekking poles are for you - you might want to see for yourself and test some, maybe loan a pair from friends for a hike and see how you get on with them. However, if your shelter needs Poles - you probably will not get around using them!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7807416278" title="HMG Porter &amp; BD Z-Poles"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/8432/7807416278_d55bc283b3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="HMG Porter &amp; BD Z-Poles" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="kitchen--water">Kitchen &amp; Water</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs also easy to spend a few hundred ‚Ç¨$¬£ on the kitchen and water carrying stuff. For the start of your backpacking hobby, get a good water filter like the <a href="https://youtu.be/CneJY3F6zuY">Katadyn BeFree</a>. This filter is very easy to use, and while there sometimes are some durability issues with the flask the customer service from Katadyn is very good and quickly sends out replacement flasks. You might want to pick up a second light water bottle (I can recommend the <a href="https://cnocoutdoors.com/collections/vecto-family/products/2019-vecto-2l-28mm?variant=20550036357209">CNOC Vecto 2l</a>) if you hike in environments where there‚Äôs not a spring every few kilometres and for camp. I also always carry a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/10/kupilka-review.html">Kupilka Kuksa</a> - the bigger one is the ideal size to prepare TentMeals in, and also for a big cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998094941/in/photostream/" title="Water and drinking"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998094941_5880327b29_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Water and drinking" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I believe that gas stoves with a Piezo ignition are the most user-friendly for beginners and experts alike, and the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/primus-lite-gas-stove/?pid=10239">Primus Lite+ Stove</a> is the most affordable one in this segment. It is light, compact, available in a variety of nice colours and very easy to use. It works well for two people, and it is fast to bring water to a boil, too. Once you want to go backpacking more it is fine to do your research on <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/the-2nd-renaissance-of-esbit.html">other stoves</a>, but for beginners an easy and convenient to use gas stove is the best investment.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30287286992/in/album-72157675269849996/" title="Camp on the fourth morning"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/5680/30287286992_aeb90feb6a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Camp on the fourth morning" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="food--snacks">Food &amp; Snacks</h2>

<p>On a longer backpacking trip food and snacks will be the heaviest thing in your backpack. Food for a week weighs for me around 5 kg, give or take, and happily this gets lighter every day. I have a plant-based diet and it‚Äôs completely possible to have nutritious, tasty vegan backpacking meals every day for a week without that you feel like <em>‚ÄúUuuagh, again the same?!‚Äù</em>. If you eat everything, it gets even easier. My favourite vegan meals are from Tent Meals and my Patreons get a 25% discount on their orders, so it‚Äôs totally worth it to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">join my Patreon tribe</a> and save on these tasty meals. Also FirePot, LYO Food, Bl√•Band and REAL Turmat make good vegan backpacking meals, and as this is going to fuel your adventure, don‚Äôt save money on these. I made that mistake on my first backpacking trips, thinking that a normal ‚Äújust add water‚Äù meal from the Supermarket is just as good, and I <strong>a)</strong> didn‚Äôt feel like eating them after two days and <strong>b)</strong> they don‚Äôt deliver the same amount of calories than the specialized backpacking meals. It feels expensive to spend 7 to 10‚Ç¨ on one backpacking dinner, but it‚Äôs really worth it - and if you‚Äôd be in a city, you would easily spend more than that on a dinner!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/41423900054/in/dateposted/" title="Dinner!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/950/41423900054_46cce273b3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dinner!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As for Snacks, I am a huge fan of honey-roasted and chili nuts with some chocolate raisins thrown in for variety. I also know that especially the Nuts will make you hugely popular with fellow hikers, so take enough to last you and a friend through the trip :) I also consume the <a href="https://www.clifbar.com/products/clif/bloks-energy-chews/black-cherry">ClifBar Bloks</a> as they are excellent to get fast energy, are tasty, and really easy to use. I have tried normal ClifBars on various trips, but for me they simply are <em>‚Äútoo much‚Äù</em> and I prefer the Bloks + Nuts.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998095301/in/photostream/" title="Snacks"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998095301_6d1a8796db_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snacks" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Coffee, Tea and Hot Chocolate are my hot drinks staples when outdoors. I have a minimum of three <a href="https://www.naturata.de/bio-produkte/kaffee-kakao/espresso-kaffee-sticks-bohnenkaffee-instant-25g/">Naturata Espresso Sticks</a> per day with me, these are easier to source than the equally good Starbucks Via, then one or two bags of tea per day, and one bag of Hot chocolate per day, as my little treat before going to sleep. Other than that I drink water, water, water, just like home =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998346927/in/dateposted/" title="Tea, Coffee, Hot Chocolate"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998346927_3a6581e412_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tea, Coffee, Hot Chocolate" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="hygiene--first-aid">Hygiene &amp; First Aid</h2>

<p>Thanks to the Pandemic we all know that we should wash our hands, outdoors this is maybe even a tad more important as we usually touch stones, trees, roots, plants and dirt when we scramble up places or walk through nature. So a good bio-degradable soap (I recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/2URUK51">Dr. Bonners Mint</a>) needs to come along, as well as a small bottle of Disinfectant. You always should brush your teeth, so a tooth brush, some tooth silk or a tooth pick, and a bio-degradable toothpaste (I prefer <a href="https://amzn.to/3hf6aJz">Dent Tabs</a> by far) need to go into the Hygiene kit, and then anything else one might want or need (stuff for contact lenses for example). I also always carry a ClimbOn LipBalm as it is great to not get dry lips and also can be applied to mosquito bites or small cuts. If you are popular with Mosquitos, an insect repellant is good to take along, or you use a headnet and long clothes to keep them off. Similarly sunscreen is useful on hikes where there is no shade and you expect to hike in the sun. You don‚Äôt need to buy these things except maybe the soap and disinfectant - use on your first hikes the same things you have at home.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998094766/in/photostream/" title="My Hygine Kit"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998094766_6ca06ba24a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="My Hygine Kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My First Aid kit is absolut minimalist, there‚Äôs a small bottle of mint oil (it works great against headaches for me), a few painkillers and band-aids in there, and that is it. I also have here a small repair kit - some patches for my air mattress, some duct tape, a security needle and that‚Äôs that. If I <strong>really</strong> need medical attention I prefer to call for help instead of trying to patch myself up with some surgical dressings which you find in the 1st Aid kits you can buy everywhere. And as in my Hygiene and First Air Kit I also have a <em>‚Äúlarge‚Äù</em> towel I can use that as a bandage if I feel I can take care of myself. Speaking of the towel, I long thought I don‚Äôt need it, but it has proven to be something that is multi-functional and hence comes along again: I can dry myself after a dip in a river or lake, wipe the dew from my shelter in the morning, hold a hot pot with it or, as above, use it as a band-aid üòÉ</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49997574068/in/photostream/" title="FA Kit"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49997574068_231c047b73_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="FA Kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="backpack">Backpack</h2>

<p>Now actually I‚Äôd put the backpack as the latest item you buy, but as this item sits totally in-between day hiking and backpacking I feel I can not talk about it at the end. However, I recommend getting this as the last item if possible, simply as it means you can purchase one which fits all the gear and food which you will have for your backpacking trips. Backpacks are a difficult topic and what works for one person does not necessarily work for another one. If you have a small, local outdoor shop go visit them, but don‚Äôt let them sell you the most expensive or heavy backpack. Osprey and Gregory are two brands which make nowadays good lightweight backpacks with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/01/osprey-levity-45-review.html">Exos</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/11/osprey-exos-48-review.html">Levity</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/gregory-optic-48.html">Optic</a> (women models are available for these, too!) and these are the models you should ask for in your shop. A backpack which has around 50 l is a good volume to aim for, with some careful packing it is good for all the gear a backpacking beginner takes along, plus the food, and this size pack also still works fine for day hikes as you can compress them nicely.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49997573963/in/photostream/" title="Packs!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49997573963_f4ee567bc6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Packs!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now real ultralight backpacking brands like <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de">HUCKEPACKS</a>, Sierra Designs, Six Moon Designs and Gossamer Gear, to name just a few, are pretty much only available online. If you want, it is totally worth it to purchase one of their backpacks, though you‚Äôll need to measure your back length, make decisions on materials and features you want, which is already quite a bit of research - of course you just can <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">read my reviews</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hendrikmorkel">watch my videos</a> to do that research, and buy accordingly üòÉ But again, I believe that a beginner should visit a independent, local gear shop and ask for one of these backpacks mentioned above, and try if they work for her or him. So far 100% of the people who got one of these packs after my recommendation are really happy with them, which is why I feel confident in recommending them (they are great packs, too!). If you then decide to pursue backpacking as a hobby you can get one of the lighter packs from the cottage brands!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44199759745/in/album-72157702073100795/" title="Stor√•d√∂rren Valley from the other side n better weather"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1903/44199759745_b4b7e1753e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Stor√•d√∂rren Valley from the other side n better weather" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="shelter">Shelter</h2>

<p>While a backpack usually doesn‚Äôt cost more than 200‚Ç¨ with the shelter and sleep system we get into an area where things get pricey. My recommendations here are to get good quality kit which does not break the bank for a beginner, if one wants to go backpacking more there‚Äôs always the option to get something different. I think most people want something which keeps bugs out (as them  üï∑ ü¶Ç are out in force in the summer). The <a href="https://www.tarptent.com/product/double-rainbow/">Double Rainbow from Tarptent</a> is a proven design at a really good price. A tent with a similar construction, slightly heavier but way easier to get in Europe and elsewhere, is the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/msr-elixir-2-2-man-tent/?pid=10239">MSR Elixir 2</a>. If your budget is a bit higher then the <a href="https://www.outdoorline.sk/en/tents/big-agnes-fly-creek-hv-ul2-ultralight-tent">Big Agnes Fly Creek HV UL2</a> or the <a href="https://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/equipment-c3/tents-shelters-c25/two-person-tents-c26/lunar-duo-explorer-2p-tent-p3325">Six Moon Designs Lunar Duo Explorer 2P Tent</a> are very good picks.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49997180938/in/dateposted/" title="Camp"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49997180938_ed7115939b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Camp" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I myself really like to sleep under a Tarp or in a Pyramide-style shelter. The <a href="https://locusgear.com/items/hapi-sil/?lang=en">Locus Gear Hapi Sil</a> is an amazing Pyramide tent, the <a href="https://www.gossamergear.com/collections/shelters-sleeping-pads/products/twinn-tarp">Gossamer Gear Twinn Tarp</a> is an absolute Classic which is easy to pitch and has a lot of dry space under it, and the <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/millaris-bivy-sack/">As Tucas Millaris Bivy Sack</a> works with either of these shelters or on it‚Äôs own if the sky is clear!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/38085020741/in/dateposted/" title="Locus Gear Hapi Sil in the morning"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4469/38085020741_56f5f2ece7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Locus Gear Hapi Sil in the morning" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If you go backpacking in Finland, Sweden or Norway you also might be able to not take a shelter at all, as you could sleep simply in one of the hundreds of free, open Wilderness Huts. The problem which might arise is that the hut is full and you can‚Äôt sleep there, so having a shelter along is always recommended. There are Huts in Finland which you can reserve, so the <em>‚ÄúThe Hut is full‚Äù</em> Problem won‚Äôt arise. And while these huts are AMAZING I do like to sleep outside, hear the birds chirp and the wind blow through the leafs. Plus you won‚Äôt be awoken by other hut inhabitants when they leave at 5:00 o‚Äôclock.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37340978576/in/dateposted/" title="Str√∂mskojan Inside"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4435/37340978576_f69dcfda81_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Str√∂mskojan Inside" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sleep-system">Sleep System</h2>

<p>Your sleep system consists of a sleeping pad, a quilt or sleeping bag and possibly a pillow (I use a insulation jacket and fold it into a pillow). The <a href="https://youtu.be/5oXFCJi0TII">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Uberlite</a> is an outstanding mattress, but maybe beginners are a bit better off with getting a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite.html">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite</a> as it is more durable and cheaper while still being light and compact. If you like to sleep on a hard underground, then the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/exped-flexmat-plus-sleeping-mat/?pid=10239">Exped Flexmat Plus</a> is a great pick as it can not break and at 40‚Ç¨ it is really cheap, while being very comfortable.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998095396/in/photostream/" title="Sleeping well"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998095396_73cbece14b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sleeping well" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At home you sleep under a duvet, and outdoors the next best thing is a quilt. I really like my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/as-tucas-sestrals-quilt.html">As Tucas Sestrals Quilt</a>, also the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/enlightened-equipment-revelation-quilts.html">enLIGHTened Equipment Revelation Quilts</a> are a very good pick, and if money is no issue I suggest getting a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/01/katabatic-gear-sawatch-quilt.html">Katabatic Gear Quilt</a>. If social and sustainable issues are important to you, have a look at the good <a href="http://tidd.ly/3d3b83f5">Vaude Alpstein 450</a>, which is a really good quilt. Again, there‚Äôs a lot of options here, but amongst those which I mentioned you can find something which suits your budget and needs!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42298562271" title="As Tucas Sestrals Quilt, front view"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/878/42298562271_534ffe1d92_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="As Tucas Sestrals Quilt, front view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="navigation-maps-and-extras">Navigation, Maps and Extras</h2>

<p>The final point on my list is about the small items which are needed to not get lost and to remember. A map and compass are pretty useful when going into nature, and I recommend for the first few trips that you stay on trails and use the map to get safely from A to B. Also an App like <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/383480947">HikePack</a> is very good to navigate (and there‚Äôs a free version!), and might be easier to use than a compass and map for beginners (despite this, the latter are important skills to learn and master!). I also carry a small <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/expedition">Field Notes Brand notebook</a> + pen with me, and obviously a camera. Unless you‚Äôre already a photographer and own a good camera, just use your phone for photos. If this is an aspect you‚Äôd like to pursue more passionately at some point, feel free to hit me up on Twitter and ask me about camera recommendations! Finally, a headlamp like the <a href="http://tidd.ly/d33332f9">Petzl Bindi</a> is good to have along if you need to get out at night or if you get up early/ stay up late. Here in the North it‚Äôs something you not necessarily need in the summer, as it doesn‚Äôt really get dark.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The best thing is if you simply could ask a good friend (like me, right Tumppi ;) who totally is into outdoor stuff and has a bunch of gear to kit you out for your first backpacking trip. That way you can see what works for you and don‚Äôt need to make purchases which may work well for you. But not everyone has that friend, so the next best thing is to do your research online, learn from other people‚Äôs mistakes and experience, and buy the right gear from the start (this does involve trusting these friends, and not deciding to throw away all the recommendations and simply buy what you think is best, just to realize after some use that the knowledgable friend actually was right all along‚Ä¶). To make checking the gear you have &amp; need easier I made <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bjsgcr5KmPblSjvjvQs3To6iCU7LYqNBczFazSJNX80/edit?usp=sharing">this Checklist</a> which you can copy &amp; paste or print out. With the list in your hands you make sure you don‚Äôt waste money on kit which you don‚Äôt need, and my tips here hopefully help you figure out which gear is worth getting. The most important thing, however, is to enjoy being outdoors.</p>

<p>Backpacking in nature is the single best way to connect to the natural environment, learn to appreciate it and see why it is so important to protect wild places. For us humans going into nature has a tremendously positive effect on our mental health, creativity and also our physical health, as several scientific articles have highlights in the past couple of years. And the whole experience of backpacking gets more enjoyable &amp; fun the less unnecessary &amp; heavy equipment we carry along while outdoors. With this article read you now know what gear you need for your first backpacking trip, and I hope it will be a most memorable one!

<p>We had 7 Shops participating in our One Stop Shop Series this year, and I created an eight Multi-Stop-Shop List for the kicks of it. Before I delve in more, here‚Äôs the lists with prices and weights side by side:</p>

</table>

<p><br />What is interesting to see is that in comparison to 2014 that the lists got a lot lighter. Where in 2014 the average list was 5.667 g heavy nowadays the average is almost 900 g lighter, at 4.868 g. However, the price per gram went up and also the average price per list went up by around 250‚Ç¨ - which, if we want to account for Inflation and such, probably is not as bad as it might sound.</p>

<p>With the exceptions of Alpinetrek andWalk On The Wild Side which are more Allround Outdoor Shops (though as we can see, who both have everything an aspiring UL Backpacker needs) we also have five shops which are selling exclusively Ultralight Outdoor Gear and are able to show us that they are Experts in their field. Ultralight Outdoor Gear has the lightest list this time around, being very close to the 4 kg mark, while Trekking-Lite-Store.com has the most affordable list at 2.085,00 ‚Ç¨.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40337489450" title="Chilling at Sunset"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/976/40337489450_c4f9faa8f6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Chilling at Sunset" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I found it very interesting to see how the weights in some categories went quite a lot down in the past five years, especially the rainwear. Where in 2014 a 350-ish gram rain jacket was ultralight, we now can get fully waterproof rainjackets and pants which are under 100 g! For a pair of garments which in the ideal case are 95% of the time in our backpack that is ideal and allows us to drop some 500 g of weight from our packs!</p>

<p>A difference to 2014 is also that we see nowadays a lot more European Cottage Brands in these lists, from Liteway, As Tucas and GramXpert to Cumulus, which means that the ultralight segment in Europe is still growing and allows these brands to succeed in the market with high-quality gear which lasts for many years. I am very happy about that, as it means more people can follow their passion and break out of the 9-to-5 grind and working to make others rich.</p>

<p>And with that our <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/one-stop-shop-2019/">One Stop Shop Series</a> of 2019 comes to an end! Thank you for following along, I hope you found the lists interesting and found out about some interesting items here and there - I for one can‚Äôt wait to pick up a rain pants and jacket which tip the scales at sub-200 g!

<p>The idea of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/one-stop-shop-2019/">One Stop Shop</a> is to buy all your gear at one shop. It saves the hassle of searching many different shops, saves on shipping [which in turn is good for the environment] and also purchasing in many different currencies like ¬£, $ and ‚Ç¨. The downside is that if you definitely want to have those Houdini trousers and fleece and the shop you purchase everything else from doesn‚Äôt carry them, well, you might just need to pick a pants from Black Diamond, Arc‚Äôteryx or Rab instead. Ah well. Here is the list I came up with if I‚Äôd buy the equipment and apparel at many different shops instead [please keep in mind that I adjusted the prices in this table to show the actual shipping, where applicable, which I‚Äôd need to pay to get it to my home in Finland, and I converted all currencies to ‚Ç¨]:</p>

<p>My thoughts on my own list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I picked the Hyperlite Mountain Gear 2400 Porter because it‚Äôs a pack I really like. It‚Äôs super simple yet durable and carries well. It does lack side pockets for my water bottles, but I have used this pack on plenty of trips and don‚Äôt mind to stop, put down the pack and get my water out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/as-tucas-sestrals-quilt.html">As Tucas Sestrals Quilt</a> is currently my go-to quilt when I go backpacking between spring and autumn. It‚Äôs a tad warm with the APEX 200 insulation I have, but I‚Äôm rather warm than too cold. The quilt works well with the UberLite, as I have tested on my trip in the Pyrenees last autumn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I chose a bivy + tarp as it is my favourite way to sleep outside. The weight and price is listed together, the Hyperlite Mountain Gear Echo 2 tarp on its own is 264 g and costs $ 355,00. The beauty about this setup is that it‚Äôs very versatile and can be pitched in small spaces, and works well with the trekking poles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tend to switch things up stove and cooking wise, and if the weather is good I go for my Esbit setup as it‚Äôs tiny and UL. When I go with friends, family or if the weather is crap I like to use a gas stove, too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rest of the kitchen setup is pretty much what I always have with me when I go out. The knife is the heavy stand-out, but as I often need a proper knife for starting a fire I like the Eldris.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clothing, with exception of the rain gear and the Arc‚Äôteryx Palisade Pants, is what I wear when I‚Äôm out. I have used the Palisades pants in the past and rate it high, but nowadays use the Houdini Motion Light Pants, though that one isn‚Äôt available anymore.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For rain clothes I picked what pretty much every shop has recommended, a Ultralight combination of pants and jacket which tip the scales at about 200 g. The rain jacket and pants I currently use are SIGNIFICANTLY heavier so an UL alternative like these listed are very welcome.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a La Sportiva Ambassador I picked the Mutant for 3-season use, it‚Äôs one of my favourite La Sportiva shoes around.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And then some tried and trusted accessories to help with hiking and illumination!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall this list has the potential to still cut down quite a bit of weight - there are lighter fleece jackets out there, lighter knives and backpacks, but this is gear I own and would buy again as I know it works well for me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What also becomes apparent is that I have created the most expensive list yet, at a tad over 3.000 ‚Ç¨ it is pretty pricey. Only part can be blamed on shipping costs, but e.g. picking up a bivy <strong>and</strong> cuben tarp is much more expensive than some other options which we have seen in the series.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyway, this is my Multi-Shop-Stop list! It orders gear from 8+ companies and includes gear from several companies where I am an Ambassador (Houdini and La Sportiva) and companies where I have worked together with [As Tucas, Hyperlite Mountain Gear, Therm-A-Rest, Petzl]. Nevertheless, if I‚Äôd need to go out and buy all my gear again, this would pretty much be the list!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Keep in mind that these lists are suggestions!</em> If you are already hiking &amp; backpacking you do not need to buy everything in one go but can replace gear slowly, and this lists merely should show you that you can purchase a complete Ultralight Backpacking Setup from one store - or in this case, from 8 different ones.

<p>My thoughts on the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This is the cheapest Price per g list yet, with an amazing price of 0,43 ‚Ç¨ per gram of kit!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a really good list with many items which we already have seen more often in this year‚Äôs series, like the Hyperlite Mountain Gear pack and the SMD shelter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Big 3 in this list bring together 2.500 g on the scales, with the kitchen adding 391 g and the accessories 401 g to the Baseweight of 3.292 g</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Big 3 are solid choices, with a really good <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/enlightened-equipment-revelation-quilts.html">Enlightened Equipment quilt</a>, a comfy and affordable sleeping mat, and a tent which should work well from early spring thill late autumn</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I really like the inclusion of a woodstove in the kitchen setup, the Hexagon folds flat and allows you to pick up your fuel at your camping spot instead of carrying it with you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The apparel is a light 1.701 g and it‚Äôs pretty cool to see so many new items like the Enlightened Equipment skirt and Wind Shirt, and the down jacket looks really toasty</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once more a fantastic list which is ultralight and what I like best, it has gear from over a dozen cottage manufacturers!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>My thoughts on the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A complete list with clothes and everything that tops out with a Baseweight of 2.838 g is pretty great (the garments and shoes are 1.903 g)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Quilt might be a bit cold for some, but with a comfy fleece jacket and a toasty puffy jacket you can pimp the sleep setup easily to make it handle colder temperatures</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nice to see a SMD shelter in this list, it is a pretty affordable tent that‚Äôs also spacious enough to get all your kit in it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A solid Alcohol setup for the kitchen, though again I personally don‚Äôt like Titanium cups for my ‚òïÔ∏è</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Zajo Bjorn Merino garments are new too me, though these Corespun garments look great</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Popular choices for the apparel, Cumulus, Montane and inov-8 we have seen quite a few time in this One Stop Shop Series so you know they are light and good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall an interesting list with some choices which we haven‚Äôt seen yet and also some regulars!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Keep in mind that these lists are suggestions!</em> If you are already hiking &amp; backpacking you do not need to buy everything in one go but can replace gear slowly, and this lists merely should show you that you can purchase a complete Ultralight Backpacking Setup from one store. Read Carsten‚Äôs take on this list in German at <a href="https://www.fastpacking.de/2019/06/11/one-stop-shop-2019-outdoorline-sk/">Fastpacking.de</a>.</p>
