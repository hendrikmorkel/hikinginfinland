<p>Last Monday was a travel day. Last Tuesday was a powder day. Life is good, right until when it is not good anymore.</p>

<p>The TransAlp sounded like an Event that was made for me: A traverse of three countries on ski, from Livigno in Italy to the Kleinwalsertal in Austria via Switzerland. It’s exactly the kind of trips I enjoy and look for, so the invitation to the adventure from <a href="https://www.marker.net/de/">Marker</a>, <a href="https://www.dalbello.it/">Dalbello</a> and <a href="https://www.voelkl.com/">Völkl</a> was after a bit of pondering and some questions quickly decided upon.</p>

<p>What I couldn’t be aware of was that a flu I had decided to trouble me up at almost 3.000 m up in the Alps, and slow me down quite a bit in comparison with my more skilled tour partners.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not far away from the busy streets of Munich you can find Austrian hospitality, empty mountains full of powder snow and warm Saunas to relax in after a day of skiing. After the ISPO I went to the Salzburger Lungau region with my brother and enjoyed a few relaxed days in this hidden gem of Austria, enjoying an untracked experience.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.lungau.at">Salzburger Lungau</a> Region is a mere couple of hours away from Munich, and unless you try to drive there on the start of some German holiday you can be in as little as one and half hours by car from Munich in the Lungau - in our case we stayed in the picturesque village of St. Margarethen in the <a href="https://www.grizzly-resort.at">Grizzly Resort Sport Hotel</a>, which is located at the base of the ski slopes. The Hotel staff expected us much later and was surprised when we walked in a bit before 20 o’clock! We checked into our rooms, had a quick shower and then it was down to the restaurant to enjoy some tasty Austrian food.</p>

<p>After Dinner I went out to photograph the stars, but soon I was so cold that I wanted to only get back inside and sleep! And as we had a long day in front of us, that’s what I did!</p>

<h2 id="ski-touring-to-the-seekpfl">Ski-touring to the Seeköpfl</h2>

<p>The next morning <a href="http://www.geführte-skitouren.at">Albert Essl</a> picked us up at the Hotel. We met Albert already two years ago when we were visiting the Salzburger Lungau in 2016 and enjoyed his guiding and company, so it was great to meet him again and go for a ski tour together.</p>

<p>Albert picked for us an easy tour for our first day, to the beautiful Seeköpfl summit. We started at a parking lot where we left the car and after a few hundred meters of walking we were stepping into our bindings and beginning to skin up. Over a narrow road we ascended deep into the forest. I really like the skinning up part of ski-touring, it’s relaxing and enjoyable for me to skin up through the forest, observe how the trees get fewer and fewer and then coming out into the open, with wide, majestic views in all directions. We were very lucky with the weather, too: Sunshine and a blue sky - it was a perfect day.</p>

<p>After a couple of hours we stood at the summit of the Seeköpfl, the sun shining down on us. We were happy, it was a beautiful day, we were outside in nature, and now a nice descent waited for us - or so we thought! The ride down was pretty icy with only a few patches of good snow, and at the end there were the dreaded narrow and icy forest roads back to the car. Ah well, there was snow in the forecast so it will be better soon!</p>

<p>After the skiing part of the day my brother and me quickly developed a good routine: Chilling on the rooms for a bit‚ then down to the Sauna, then getting dressed and off to Dinner. It was a pretty good Sauna at the Hotel, and it’s nice that in the Southern countries they often have a wee Bar with juices, water, nuts and tea where you can drink &amp; eat a bite during Sauna turns.</p>

<h2 id="skiing-on-the-katschberg-aineck">Skiing on the Katschberg-Aineck</h2>

<p>The next morning I looked out of the window and it was grey and white. The clouds were low and it was snowing a little, but the snow should really start dumping in the afternoon. Hence my brother and me decided to ride the <a href="http://katschi.at/pistenplaene.html">Katschberg-Aineck</a> ski slopes, and with a chair lift in front of the hotel we didn’t have a long way to get there, either! It’s a big ski region with 70 km of slopes and 16 lifts, and you can have days and days of fun here. We enjoyed the A1 slope the most, as it offers some superb views on the valley, as you’ll see from the photos. A benefit of skiing on the slopes is also that you can eat in one of the huts, and it is something I always like to do, with the tasty Germknödel being my lunch of choice! Another benefit of skiing on the slopes is that you just ride down to your hotel and then can be in the Sauna in a matter of minutes 💦🔥👍</p>

<h2 id="exploring-schnfeld-and-the-nockberge">Exploring Schönfeld and the Nockberge</h2>

<p>The next morning it indeed was still dumping snow, and the forecasted 80 cm of fresh powder seemed very realistic. After a tasty breakfast we went outside to clean the car, and boy was it snowed in! After we almost dug out the car we took off towards the Nockberge, a truly hidden gem of the Salzburger Lungau.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/39940945044/in/album-72157663383796697/" title="Snow!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4708/39940945044_b8f8c91281_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snow!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/39940953404/in/album-72157663383796697/" title="Snowy roads"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4708/39940953404_76daea129a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snowy roads" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Even when the road was cleared that same morning by the time we were on our way to the Dr. Josef-Mehrl-Hütte another 5 cm of pow ❄️❄️❄️ was on the street and my brother was concerned if we’d actually make it back - there was a rather steep road to get up on the way back. But that was none of my worry right now, I just loved the truly white and snowy surroundings we were in.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40650309221/in/album-72157663383796697/" title="Snowy rivver"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4758/40650309221_8dbff37f6f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snowy rivver" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We made it to the beautiful Dr. Josef-Mehrl-Hütte, parked the car and stepped into our bindings. Our goal was the Matehanshöhe, another easy tour, and given that there was a high Avalanche Danger with the fresh snow we wanted something that was safe and easy. The ascent went for the first part via the closed ski slope and then along a ridge till the summit, though as my brother is not used to so deep powder we decided to cut the tour a bit short, not make for the summit and head back down and enjoy the powder!</p>

<p>After the trip we enjoyed a lunch of Kaiserschmarrn at the hut before safely making it back to the Hotel in the afternoon, with plenty of time to pack, go to the Sauna and enjoy Dinner. Alas, this was our last evening together, and our short trip to the beautiful mountains of Austria were almost over again. I guess we’ll return again, as there’s still so many powdery summits and beautiful views we’d like to see!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-there-and-where-to-stay">How to get there and where to stay</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.lungau.at/en/service/arrival/">travel by train and bus to the Salzburger Lungau</a> to it is the most easiest to arrive by car. A rental car for a week can cost around as little as 120€ and allows you to get around really easy in the region, which is almost mandatory if you want to go ski-touring.</p>

<p>There’s <a href="http://booking.lungau.at/lungau/en/accommodation/list?customHeader=true">over 700 accommodation options</a> in the Salzburger Lungau, with something for every budget level (<em>It makes sense to check out the <a href="https://www.lungau.at/en/accommodation/package-offers/">Package Offers</a> where you often can safe quite nicely</em>). We stayed at the <a href="https://www.grizzly-resort.at/hotel/">Grizzly Resort Sport Hotel</a>, a very relaxed and high-quality 4 ⭐️ Hotel right next to the ski slopes. We can completely recommend the hotel with its tasty breakfast buffet, relaxing Spa &amp; Sauna, comfortable and spacious rooms and delicious 3-Course Menus in the evening.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After the ISPO I did the only smart thing: Leave the city behind and head to Austria to go ski-touring. These are some first impressions from a too-short trip to the Salzburger Lungau Region.</p>

<p>After a very busy fair I met my brother and we made the trip down south to the <a href="https://www.lungau.at/en/your-lungau/15-villages/?_wb=en/your-lungau/15-villages/&amp;lang=EN">Salzburger Lungau</a> Region, a place we have visited before and really liked. We arrived at our <a href="https://www.grizzly-resort.at">Hotel</a>, had a tasty dinner and then it was off to bed as early in the morning we would meet Albert again, our <a href="http://www.geführte-skitouren.at">Ski-touring Guide</a> with whom we had the pleasure to go skiing already in the past.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25225601117/in/dateposted/" title="Start of the tour."><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4770/25225601117_d228306e86_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Start of the tour." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Albert had two other clients along and our little group was great, we had a lot of fun on the ascent and descent. It was a beautiful sunny day with great views - just the snow could have been a wee bit better.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25225603587/in/dateposted/" title="Through the less-than-perfect snow down."><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4761/25225603587_f2d6bb985b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Through the less-than-perfect snow down." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The view from the Hotel wasn’t bad at all, either. We witnessed the #SuperBlueMoon rising behind the forest as we sat in the Sauna, not a bad place at all!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25225606417/in/dateposted/" title="Timelapse."><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4673/25225606417_0a106ea3e0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Timelapse." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The next day we hot the slopes. With a big ski resort right in front of the hotel it was not a long approach, and the skiing was good - though I really prefer soft snow on wild mountains. A good thing that a 80 cm dump of powder was forecast for the next day!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25225605937/in/dateposted/" title="Snow?

<p>And so my brother and me headed again to the secluded Thomatal Valley and started from the Dr. Josef-Mehrl Hütte up into the mountains, not to be disappointed by the amount of snow.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Winter is coming</em>.</p>

<p>Yes, the new GoT Season just started, and I couldn’t help myself and add that reference. But seriously, winter is coming soon enough and what better time is now than to dream about skiing chin-deep powder and purchase a limited edition of the World’s best skis, the DPS Alchemist?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35890163671/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Alchemist x contour skins in Lyngen 2017"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4296/35890163671_4f0cc4ae05_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DPS Alchemist x contour skins in Lyngen 2017" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/gear-of-the-year-dps-wailer-tour1-skis.html">I love my DPS Skis</a>. Yes, they are not cheap. But good things seldom are (exceptions include spending time outdoors in the mountains on skis &amp; sleeping in a tent) so when it’s the middle of summer and we snow-loving people are just begging for the white, fluffy stuff to return it’s also a good moment to shop for new skis. And that’s what <a href="https://www.dpsskis.com/en/dreamtime-2017">DPS Dreamtime</a> is all about:</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35981791526/in/dateposted/" title="Mark Your Calendar"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4318/35981791526_7c0a7fb09c_b.jpg" width="800" height="800" alt="Mark Your Calendar" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Dreamtime is the only time ever that DPS Skis are discounted, and to top things of awesome limited-run artwork Special Edition skis are also available. Here’s a few impressions from their factory in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, on what you can get:</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35183918474/in/dateposted/" title="PW Cassiar 87"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4296/35183918474_4ff96bba31_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="PW Cassiar 87" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The carbon pressing machines at DPS are so photogenic, don’t you think? That’s an equally photogenic pair of <a href="https://www.dpsskis.com/en/powderworks-cassiar-87">Powderworks Cassiar 87</a> skis standing in front of the press.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35889866351/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Factory 02"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4303/35889866351_bf88dd0c15_b.jpg" width="800" height="800" alt="DPS Factory 02" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Them Austrian world cup race bases are prepped and ready to be mated with the ski. They’re fast, in case you didn’t see the <em>Race</em> in their name.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35889865881/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Dreamtime Skis"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4309/35889865881_f7157618e5_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="DPS Dreamtime Skis" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And that are the Special Edition Artworks for the Wailer, Yvette, Zelda and Nina Skis. Damn, they are awesome! If I wouldn’t own a pair of Alchemist Wailer Skis already I’d be very tempted to get another pair! Thus if you, like me, can’t wait for winter to arrive, then a pair of <a href="https://www.dpsskis.com/en/dreamtime-2017">DPS Dreamtime</a> Skis might just be what makes the waiting time go by easier. And then, when the first big snow flakes start to cover the mountains, then you are ready to go hit the slopes on your new DPS Skis.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34422359486/in/album-72157681319341321/" title="Powder Turns"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4181/34422359486_b3c2ceae39_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Powder Turns" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ski-touring without certain items just isn’t smart. So you’re not going out into the mountains without the right kit, here’s a look at what you should have along when you skin up the next mountain to enjoy some sweet pow!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25686718380/in/album-72157665020355632/" title="Will and Anselm discussing our run"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/2/1690/25686718380_3134f5b330_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Will and Anselm discussing our run" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>No one likes to think about avalanches when he goes out into the backcountry, but it is a danger that is always present when we go off-piste, searching for deep powder fields and steep runs. As I set out ski-touring last winter my first thoughts went straight to safety - maybe because as a dad of two kids coming home healthy and in one piece is very important to me. Even if you’re not a mom or dad I imagine you too want to come safely home from a ski-touring trip, and hence the topic of safety is something we need to talk about.</p>

<p>But before I delve into the gear which you should wear and carry the most important part is to apply ones common sense, aka the grey squishy bit between your ears. We all probably feel like we have to little time out in the mountains, so when the avalanche danger is high while we have that short ski vacation we might be tempted to forgo the warnings and still go up the mountain. Well, just don’t - or go somewhere where it is safe.</p>

<p>Avalanche safety really starts before you start out on the hills, so make sure check avalanche bulletin of your region and talk with local(s) (mountain guides &amp; ski teachers, for example). That you should know how to use your gear - from beacon to probe &amp; proper shovelling - goes without saying really, and if you’re new to the game do yourself a favour and visit a avalanche course or two before you head out into the hills. Then when the warning is low and the slopes are calling, it is safe to go and find that deep pow stash!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31084355955/in/dateposted/" title="My Avalanche safety kit"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5649/31084355955_5ab3f5b2ce_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="My Avalanche safety kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So what’s the safety gear I wear &amp; carry when I head out to the mountains? Around my body I wear the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/pieps-dsp-pro-ice-beacon/?pid=10239">PIEPS DSP Pro Ice</a> Avalanche Beacon. This beacon packs a lot of functions - the most important ones for me are the large 60 m search radius, because this would allow me in case of a burial to detect a mate already from further away; and the three antennas allow for a precise localization of the signal, minimizing the time you spent probing the snow. The Mark function lets me mark mates in case of multiple burials, and as it can be very bright &amp; white in the mountains it is very useful that the display is easy to read in any light &amp; shows the direction plus distance of the burial clearly.</p>

<p>The DSP Pro Ice is also dead easy to use and the 400 hour battery life means I can go out a season long and don’t need to switch batteries. It performs a self-check at start-up and lets you know when it is OK, has 5 years of warranty and also come with the carry system you see in the photo. There’s a lot of tech in this beacon but the size and weight are still pretty good. However, if I would be in the market again I’d be tempted to pick up the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/pieps-micro-beacon/?pid=10239">PIEPS Micro Beacon</a> because not only is it cheaper than the DSP Pro Ice, it is also lighter and smaller! But at 198 g the PIEPS DSP Pro Ice isn’t really too heavy, and I rarely realize I am wearing it when I skin up or ski down a mountain. I switch it on when I start my ascent, and switch it off when back down. All in all I am very happy with this beacon and can recommend it if you’re looking for the best beacon with the most features on the market.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/pieps-dsp-pro-ice-beacon/?pid=10239" title="PIEPS DSP Pro Ice"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5789/31048607056_e80bf29f6b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="PIEPS DSP Pro Ice" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I’m using a <a href="http://bit.ly/2f6XBPH">G3 SpadeTECH Shovel</a> and a <a href="http://bit.ly/2fLL8m3">G3 240 Speed TECH Probe</a> because I got them for free when I <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/arcteryx-workshop-tour.html">visited Arc’teryx in Vancouver</a> last year. They are light and compact, deploy fast when needed and the shovel is easy to use, also with thick gloves on. The 240 cm probe is on the shorter side, but thus far (in practices) I have never needed a longer probe.</p>

<p>I’m always carrying a small FA Kit - sometimes the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/ortovox-first-aid-light-first-aid-kit/?pid=10239">ORTOVOX First Aid Light</a> but usually just a super-small MYOG kit (couple of Compeeds, an emergency bivy/ blanket and a few pain killers). These commercial kits are alright but I find the are over-specced and one doesn’t need that much gear when outside, and they’re also pretty big - when I’m out ski-touring I only have a 25l pack and space comes at a premium. If you have a bigger pack you might not have this problem &amp; can carry a large FA kit, but if you’re experienced &amp; know what you might need take a smaller &amp; lighter kit, suitable to your needs.</p>

<p>All of that I carry in my <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/black-diamond-dawn-patrol-25-ski-touring-backpack/?pid=10239">Black Diamond Dawn Patrol 25</a> which also has the extra <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/black-diamond-avalung-element-breathing-system/?pid=10239">Avalung Breathing System</a>. The Dawn Patrol 25 pack has a front avy tool pocket which means I can access my shovel and probe super-fast when needed and I don’t need to first dig through my pack to find shovel &amp; probe, which is very important in an emergency situation. I actually was able to fit crampons, extra clothes, a thermos and water as well as skins and snacks into this pack when I was doing the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/03/teaser-graubunden-haute-route.html">Graubünden Haute-Route</a>!</p>

<p>That’s it! With this gear I can tour safely in the mountains, know I can help a friend if he would get buried and have a fair chance at also surviving an avalanche. But remember: The most important bit is to not go into avalanche terrain, know your limits and practice your skills so that you can come home again! Stay safe in the mountains and enjoy the summits &amp; powder!</p>
