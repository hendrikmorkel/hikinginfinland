    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Winter is coming</em>.</p>

<p>Yes, the new GoT Season just started, and I couldn’t help myself and add that reference. But seriously, winter is coming soon enough and what better time is now than to dream about skiing chin-deep powder and purchase a limited edition of the World’s best skis, the DPS Alchemist?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35890163671/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Alchemist x contour skins in Lyngen 2017"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4296/35890163671_4f0cc4ae05_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DPS Alchemist x contour skins in Lyngen 2017" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/gear-of-the-year-dps-wailer-tour1-skis.html">I love my DPS Skis</a>. Yes, they are not cheap. But good things seldom are (exceptions include spending time outdoors in the mountains on skis &amp; sleeping in a tent) so when it’s the middle of summer and we snow-loving people are just begging for the white, fluffy stuff to return it’s also a good moment to shop for new skis. And that’s what <a href="https://www.dpsskis.com/en/dreamtime-2017">DPS Dreamtime</a> is all about:</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35981791526/in/dateposted/" title="Mark Your Calendar"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4318/35981791526_7c0a7fb09c_b.jpg" width="800" height="800" alt="Mark Your Calendar" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Dreamtime is the only time ever that DPS Skis are discounted, and to top things of awesome limited-run artwork Special Edition skis are also available. Here’s a few impressions from their factory in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, on what you can get:</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35183918474/in/dateposted/" title="PW Cassiar 87"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4296/35183918474_4ff96bba31_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="PW Cassiar 87" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The carbon pressing machines at DPS are so photogenic, don’t you think? That’s an equally photogenic pair of <a href="https://www.dpsskis.com/en/powderworks-cassiar-87">Powderworks Cassiar 87</a> skis standing in front of the press.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35889866351/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Factory 02"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4303/35889866351_bf88dd0c15_b.jpg" width="800" height="800" alt="DPS Factory 02" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Them Austrian world cup race bases are prepped and ready to be mated with the ski. They’re fast, in case you didn’t see the <em>Race</em> in their name.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35889865881/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Dreamtime Skis"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4309/35889865881_f7157618e5_b.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="DPS Dreamtime Skis" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And that are the Special Edition Artworks for the Wailer, Yvette, Zelda and Nina Skis. Damn, they are awesome! If I wouldn’t own a pair of Alchemist Wailer Skis already I’d be very tempted to get another pair! Thus if you, like me, can’t wait for winter to arrive, then a pair of <a href="https://www.dpsskis.com/en/dreamtime-2017">DPS Dreamtime</a> Skis might just be what makes the waiting time go by easier. And then, when the first big snow flakes start to cover the mountains, then you are ready to go hit the slopes on your new DPS Skis.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ski-touring without certain items just isn’t smart. So you’re not going out into the mountains without the right kit, here’s a look at what you should have along when you skin up the next mountain to enjoy some sweet pow!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25686718380/in/album-72157665020355632/" title="Will and Anselm discussing our run"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/2/1690/25686718380_3134f5b330_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Will and Anselm discussing our run" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>No one likes to think about avalanches when he goes out into the backcountry, but it is a danger that is always present when we go off-piste, searching for deep powder fields and steep runs. As I set out ski-touring last winter my first thoughts went straight to safety - maybe because as a dad of two kids coming home healthy and in one piece is very important to me. Even if you’re not a mom or dad I imagine you too want to come safely home from a ski-touring trip, and hence the topic of safety is something we need to talk about.</p>

<p>But before I delve into the gear which you should wear and carry the most important part is to apply ones common sense, aka the grey squishy bit between your ears. We all probably feel like we have to little time out in the mountains, so when the avalanche danger is high while we have that short ski vacation we might be tempted to forgo the warnings and still go up the mountain. Well, just don’t - or go somewhere where it is safe.</p>

<p>Avalanche safety really starts before you start out on the hills, so make sure check avalanche bulletin of your region and talk with local(s) (mountain guides &amp; ski teachers, for example). That you should know how to use your gear - from beacon to probe &amp; proper shovelling - goes without saying really, and if you’re new to the game do yourself a favour and visit a avalanche course or two before you head out into the hills. Then when the warning is low and the slopes are calling, it is safe to go and find that deep pow stash!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31084355955/in/dateposted/" title="My Avalanche safety kit"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5649/31084355955_5ab3f5b2ce_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="My Avalanche safety kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So what’s the safety gear I wear &amp; carry when I head out to the mountains? Around my body I wear the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/pieps-dsp-pro-ice-beacon/?pid=10239">PIEPS DSP Pro Ice</a> Avalanche Beacon. This beacon packs a lot of functions - the most important ones for me are the large 60 m search radius, because this would allow me in case of a burial to detect a mate already from further away; and the three antennas allow for a precise localization of the signal, minimizing the time you spent probing the snow. The Mark function lets me mark mates in case of multiple burials, and as it can be very bright &amp; white in the mountains it is very useful that the display is easy to read in any light &amp; shows the direction plus distance of the burial clearly.</p>

<p>The DSP Pro Ice is also dead easy to use and the 400 hour battery life means I can go out a season long and don’t need to switch batteries. It performs a self-check at start-up and lets you know when it is OK, has 5 years of warranty and also come with the carry system you see in the photo. There’s a lot of tech in this beacon but the size and weight are still pretty good. However, if I would be in the market again I’d be tempted to pick up the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/pieps-micro-beacon/?pid=10239">PIEPS Micro Beacon</a> because not only is it cheaper than the DSP Pro Ice, it is also lighter and smaller! But at 198 g the PIEPS DSP Pro Ice isn’t really too heavy, and I rarely realize I am wearing it when I skin up or ski down a mountain. I switch it on when I start my ascent, and switch it off when back down. All in all I am very happy with this beacon and can recommend it if you’re looking for the best beacon with the most features on the market.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/pieps-dsp-pro-ice-beacon/?pid=10239" title="PIEPS DSP Pro Ice"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5789/31048607056_e80bf29f6b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="PIEPS DSP Pro Ice" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I’m using a <a href="http://bit.ly/2f6XBPH">G3 SpadeTECH Shovel</a> and a <a href="http://bit.ly/2fLL8m3">G3 240 Speed TECH Probe</a> because I got them for free when I <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/arcteryx-workshop-tour.html">visited Arc’teryx in Vancouver</a> last year. They are light and compact, deploy fast when needed and the shovel is easy to use, also with thick gloves on. The 240 cm probe is on the shorter side, but thus far (in practices) I have never needed a longer probe.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30941962332/in/dateposted/" title="G3 SpadeTECH Shovel"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5703/30941962332_364908af1d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="G3 SpadeTECH Shovel" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30941957112/in/dateposted/" title="G3 240 Speed TECH Probe Details"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5752/30941957112_e84f4160c1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="G3 240 Speed TECH Probe Details" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I’m always carrying a small FA Kit - sometimes the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/ortovox-first-aid-light-first-aid-kit/?pid=10239">ORTOVOX First Aid Light</a> but usually just a super-small MYOG kit (couple of Compeeds, an emergency bivy/ blanket and a few pain killers). These commercial kits are alright but I find the are over-specced and one doesn’t need that much gear when outside, and they’re also pretty big - when I’m out ski-touring I only have a 25l pack and space comes at a premium. If you have a bigger pack you might not have this problem &amp; can carry a large FA kit, but if you’re experienced &amp; know what you might need take a smaller &amp; lighter kit, suitable to your needs.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30941960662/in/dateposted/" title="Ortovox First Aid Light Kit"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5479/30941960662_ed039fde7a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ortovox First Aid Light Kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>All of that I carry in my <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/black-diamond-dawn-patrol-25-ski-touring-backpack/?pid=10239">Black Diamond Dawn Patrol 25</a> which also has the extra <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/black-diamond-avalung-element-breathing-system/?pid=10239">Avalung Breathing System</a>. The Dawn Patrol 25 pack has a front avy tool pocket which means I can access my shovel and probe super-fast when needed and I don’t need to first dig through my pack to find shovel &amp; probe, which is very important in an emergency situation. I actually was able to fit crampons, extra clothes, a thermos and water as well as skins and snacks into this pack when I was doing the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/03/teaser-graubunden-haute-route.html">Graubünden Haute-Route</a>!</p>

<p>That’s it! With this gear I can tour safely in the mountains, know I can help a friend if he would get buried and have a fair chance at also surviving an avalanche. But remember: The most important bit is to not go into avalanche terrain, know your limits and practice your skills so that you can come home again! Stay safe in the mountains and enjoy the summits &amp; powder!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Winter is coming</em>. And that means I’ll again step into the bindings of my DPS Wailer Tour1 Skis, skin up a fine mountain, put down my heel and flow through the pow!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26148754403/in/album-72157665452784994/" title="At the summit"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/2/1681/26148754403_5dff0ce1e6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="At the summit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Picking my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/gear-of-the-year/">Gear of the Year</a> isn’t easy: There’s a lot of equipment that comes over my table (happily a lot <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/01/zero-gear-year.html">less this year</a>) and while that alone isn’t what makes it hard, it’s those favourites which I have used for many years which make it difficult, as these favourites are always strong contenders for my Gear of the Year Award. But while I really love my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a> it is my <a href="http://www.dpsskis.com/en/skis/browse-skis-by-shape/all-mountain-mixed-snow/wailer-430.html">DPS Wailer Tour1 Skis</a> which I chose this year, because of two reasons: 1. They allow me to be more in the mountains and 2. They’re some of the lightest ski-touring skis on the market.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25738443973/in/album-72157664672954972/" title="Tools of joy!"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/2/1598/25738443973_d7b1af966a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tools of joy!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>These skis (as well as the <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/g3-ion-12-tourenbindung-16-17/?pid=81">bindings</a>, <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/contour-hybrid-free-split-skins-skifell-s/?pid=81">skins</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/04/la-sportiva-spectre.html">boots</a>) have accompanied me to Canada, South Tyrol, Austria, Finnish Lapland, Switzerland and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/05/lyngen.html">Norway</a> and I have stood almost 30 days on them. Thirty days in the wintery mountains, that’s pretty sweet in my book. Simply because in my book a day spent in the mountains is a day well spent. And if I can be active, skin up a mountain with good friends, smile together at the summit and then put down my heel to carve a fine line into the fresh powder, well, I can imagine few things which would be better in winter &amp; which make me so happy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25105375706/in/album-72157664672954972/" title="I like crust, but I only like it on Crème brûlée"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/2/1676/25105375706_0f539523c5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="I like crust, but I only like it on Crème brûlée" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I was skiing with my brother in South Tyrol and we went on a ski-tour while it was dumping snow. We were the only ones out that day, and as we reached that cabin down there, sat down in it and drunk some hot tea, we didn’t care that the summit would be some other 20 minutes of skining further up the mountain. We sat there, sweaty, smiling, munching a chocolate bar, and looking forward to ski down through that fresh powder.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24460363514/in/album-72157664166747400/" title="I love me a nice cabin!"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/2/1466/24460363514_7edaab5590_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="I love me a nice cabin!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I Switzerland Anselm, Willi and me wanted to complete the <a href="http://www.hauteroute-graubuenden.ch">Graubünden Haute Route</a> but conditions conspired against us. While this winter wasn’t particularly good the week we were in Switzerland the Avalanche Danger was so high that we weren’t able to do the complete Haute Route. That didn’t hinder us from having a grand time in the Swiss Mountains, staying with some fantastic hut wardens, skiing some great lines and feeling happy while standing on our skis.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26436513541/in/album-72157665020355632/" title="Boot-packing up"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/2/1490/26436513541_8e1264ac4b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Boot-packing up" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <a href="http://bit.ly/2eUHSEx">DPS Wailer Tour1 Skis</a> are award winning skis which are Made in Utah, USA. They’re ultralight at 1.410 g per ski and 184 cm length, which is great when you’re having days with lots of ascent - the low weight is very energy saving. You’ll float through powder with a smile on your face and will be happy on spring crust - through stay off-piste as that’s the one thing they don’t really like (and weren’t made for). But powder, well, you’ll surf through it, make ace turns and throw up some cold smoke that you wish will never end.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25816133670/in/album-72157665518007630/" title="Backcountry fun on Jyppyrä, Hetta Hiihtomaa"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/2/1675/25816133670_564e5094cc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Backcountry fun on Jyppyrä, Hetta Hiihtomaa" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So, that possibility - to surf through a meter of fresh snow and then skin back up to take a 2nd run - that’s why I love my <strong>DPS Wailer Tour1 Skis</strong> and that’s why they are my <strong>Gear of the Year</strong>. I’m sure they will allow me to collect a lot more of fine winter mountain skiing memories, and for that I am grateful.</p>

<p>If you want to experience the mountains in winter and float through the powder, buy a pair at <a href="http://bit.ly/2fnPt2K">evo</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/2eUHSEx">Backcountry.com</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/2f645Qd">REI</a> or <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/dps-wailer-106-tour1-tourenski-16-17-168cm/?pid=81">Bergzeit</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ski-touring in late April: Daylight from 4 am till 10 pm, great powder or spring crust, wall-to-wall sunshine &amp; all topped off with that breath-taking fjord &amp; mountain view of the Lyngen Alps.</p>

<p>Together with Henryk from <a href="http://www.oooyeah.de">Out of Office</a> I spent a fantastic week in the Lyngen Alps. Here’s a wee teaser so you can book your flight tickets and accommodation there for next spring, because it most certainly is a place you want to be. It all starts in Tromsø, where already the approach by plane is breath-taking. Then you go for a walk in the old town and pick up your Van from <a href="http://www.takemeaway.no">Take me Away Camping</a> to head north-west to the Lyngen Alps and their surroundings.</p>

<p>You probably want to stop to take in the view once in a while.</p>

<p>When your bindings decides to break you go for a walk along the coast of Arnøya and make a stop in a lovely little cabin.</p>

<p>You take the ferry and enjoy the smell of the sea on deck.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26741113346/in/dateposted/" title="On a ferry"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1610/26741113346_46c00d88e5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="On a ferry" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And what’s wrong with sitting down in the sun and have a beer (after a day of skiing, obviously!)?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26160876694/in/dateposted/" title="After-Ski beers"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1538/26160876694_c5b83977c5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="After-Ski beers" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On the summit you snap a selfie with that big grin because the view is so amazing.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26160876794/in/dateposted/" title="Summit Selfie"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1504/26160876794_3853aab70b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit Selfie" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And while the tide is low you go for a walk along the beach.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26741128296/in/dateposted/" title="Evening Sunset"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1464/26741128296_d26a5e3531_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Evening Sunset" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Or you go skiing while the sun sets.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26741129446/in/dateposted/" title="Sunset skiing"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1719/26741129446_117610d8ae_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunset skiing" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On blue-bird days the summits can be busy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26160876444/in/dateposted/" title="Busy summit"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1462/26160876444_69cf794b5c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Busy summit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But there’s enough fjords so you can have one for yourself to enjoy the sunset.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26160876304/in/dateposted/" title="Fjord sunset"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1489/26160876304_454bd5c53c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Fjord sunset" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So, book those tickets to Norway now, reserve your adventure van, and then check back in autumn to get the full low-down on our roadtrip ski-touring adventure.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In late February and early March I made a visit to Switzerland to attempt the Graubünden Haute Route. Sadly the high avalanche danger and changing weather cut us short - here’s a first taste of four days ski-touring in Graubünden.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hauteroute-graubuenden.ch">Graubünden Haute Route</a> is a five days/ four nights ski-touring trip where you visit four beautiful huts, ski great powder, test your mountaineering skills while climbing some beautiful peaks and enjoy great scenary. Well, that’s at least the normal plan, but because of not really good weather and high avalanche danger our trip was cut a wee bit short. Stay tuned for a full day-to-day account of my Haute Route experience, but for now enjoy these fine selection of photos!</p>

<p>Day one we skied from Madulain to the D’Es-Cha Hut, where we spent in the end two nights because we didn’t want to risk our lives in highly dangerous avalanche terrain. It’s a beautiful hut with great wardens, a wide selection of board and card games as well as interesting magazines - so we didn’t get bored while waiting for better weather.</p>

<p>In the end we skied back to Madulain, took the loveley UNESCO World Heritage train to Bergün and took the long way up to the Kesch Hut.</p>

<p>Reto, the warden, welcomed us in heinous winds to his hut with a very taste cup of hot, sweet tea. His wife Ursina cooked us a delicious dinner and we slept great - ready for our fourth day, with high hopes of better weather yet again.</p>
