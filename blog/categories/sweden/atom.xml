<h2 id="hello-sweden">Hello Sweden!</h2>

<p>It’s one o’clock as I cycle over to the ferry harbour in Vaasa, lock my bike and check in. Before me are four hours of ferry boredom but happily it’s much cheaper and more environmentally friendly to take the boat than to fly first to Stockholm and then to Umeå. Besides, Umeå is the closest city to Vaasa if one wouldn’t take the Baltic in account! I spend my time on the boat reading a book on the Kindle App and watching Youtube Videos while drinking coffee and enjoying a tasty Pulla in the Café. Then, finally, we start to see the first islands and it ain’t too long until we arrive at the harbour in Umeå. Usually I’d would have to take a Bus and then another Bus to get where I need to go, but I’m lucky as Elisabeth from the Bjurholm kommun was in town and can give me a ride to Agnäs, where I will spend the first night as a guest of <a href="http://agnasstugby.se">Agnäs Stugor</a>.</p>

<p>I have a own cozy cottage where I roll out my quilt, boil some water and eat one of the meals I brought, along with an Astronaut ice cream - because the sooner that food bag gets lighter and smaller, the better! As I lounge around on the sofa I realize I forgot to bring my Powerbank, which isn’t a smart move - I need it to keep the phone charged as I need it for flying my <a href="http://amzn.to/2hu4iPU">drone</a>. Ah well, I’ll make it work, I think, and then head to sleep after a final hot shower.</p>

<h2 id="rtrsk-to-nsland">Örträsk to Näsland</h2>

<p>It’s a misty morning as my alarm rings at 6:30 am and I get up. I boil hot water in the kitchen for coffee and Müsli, pack up my backpack and then am waiting outside for Claudia, who works for the Bjurholm Community and will drop me off at the start of the trail as she has business in that direction that morning either way. It’s a perk to not needing to stand and wait for a bus up North, which makes the whole logistics part a wee bit easier. I drop off the key to my cottage, say bye to the sheep and then promptly Claudia arrives and we start the ride to Örträsk.</p>

<p>The road is very scenic and sometimes I’m almost asking her to stop the car so I could take some photos, but then I re-consider and just let her drive. After some 45 minutes we take a turn and I already see the Öreälven river. A minute later she backs up into a small road and tell’s me <em>“We are here!”</em>. The sky is grey and I much rather would be sitting in a warm car or Café, but hey - lets get started!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37340952986/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Start of the trail"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4482/37340952986_f8d2a6583d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Start of the trail" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37305380575/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Start of the trail!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4441/37305380575_55f457cb81_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Start of the trail!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The sign shows the way, and up here in the Bjurholm community the trail is superbly marked - sometimes every tree has a red or orange dot! I walk two minutes along the gravel road, and that were exactly the two minutes my shoes were dry on the trail: I make a turn down to the river and after six steps through the high grass my shoes are soaking wet.</p>

<p>And then I see the river, and a not that silent <em>DAMN!</em> leaves my mouth: In a last minute decision the previous day I decided to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BY83wAtBy9S/?taken-by=hendrikm">not take my packraft</a>, a decision which I highly regret that moment standing in front of this river. Swiftly it floats past by me, and I picture myself sitting in my packraft and just leisurely floating the river down. Alas, packraft and paddle are at home and I’ll need to use my two feet to get to the Baltic.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37388438031/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Old Flating Dam south of Örträsk"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4466/37388438031_8e13568663_b.jpg" width="1024" height="767" alt="Old Flating Dam south of Örträsk" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A couple of minutes later I arrive at the Floaters Dam, and the small hut besides the river is inviting with it’s beds and table by the window. But as I plan to walk around 30 km each day it’d be a bit pre-mature to call it a day after one kilometre, and so I shoulder my backpack and enter the wild forest along the Öreälv river. And wild it is: The narrow path is never far away from the river, which runs next to me. Sometimes I need to back-track because parts of the trail are so deep under water that I rather look for a dry way around it than trying to jump over it, other times the trail is climbing high up a steep shoulder of a ridge and should one lose the footing one might end up with very wet pants, standing in the river. These sections will not present any problems for an experienced backpacker with a light backpack, though if you haul 20+ kg through the forest on your second or third trip you might feel like you’ve been presented a real challenge.</p>

<p>As it is autumn - <em>PRIME AUTUMN</em>, to be correct - the Mushrooms are in abundance along the trail. Small, big, colourful or inconspicuous, edible and poisonous - there’s so many of them that at some point I gave up to document them all.</p>

<p>And then something unexpected happens: The sky clears up and the sun shows up. I rejoice, shed the hardshell and enjoy the golden light finding it’s way through the leaves of the birches whose leafs try to match the colour of the sun. The blue sky appears over me and the green, yellow and orange forest, while the dark river continues to flow never-ending towards the Baltic. <em>“Ah, if I’d just had my packraft along!”</em> is a thought I more than once utter that day. I pass smaller rapids and the most lovely little cottages and simple lean-to shelters. Water for drinking is never far away - just hold the <a href="http://bit.ly/2h29SMs">Katadyn BeFree</a> into the river, screw on the lid and drink!</p>

<p>I hike at a for me slow 3 km/h and at around 17:00 o’clock reach the Näslandsforsen Hut, a lovely cabin with a green roof, not far from the river, plenty of wood and a large sleeping platform. While I planned to sleep at the Mariebäck Hut I decide to stay here, and quickly set up my camp, collect water, carry in wood and clean up the mess others had left before me. As night starts to fall I light the fire, lay on my mat and <a href="https://youtu.be/4jBr_W4iGi4">eat a Trek’N Eat Meal</a>. With a full belly and some 23 km covered it doesn’t take long for me to fall asleep in my warm cabin that night.</p>

<h2 id="nslandsforsen-to-storforsen">Näslandsforsen to Storforsen</h2>

<p>The next morning I wake up before dawn, light a little fire to get the cabin warm and boil the water I got the previous evening. Laying under my Quilt I drink a coffee and eat a Müsli, pondering how to structure my day and where to sleep tonight. As my phone’s battery is still quite good at some 70% full I decide to hike this morning into Bjurholm, have coffee and a Kanelbullar while charging the phone back to 100%. The black &amp; white map I have gives little infos about distance, though I reckon it shouldn’t be more than 8 km to the town.</p>

<p>The morning starts with a blue sky but quickly clouds start to race through the sky. The trail is lovely again, just like the previous day it is very well marked with plenty of trail blazes. Well before 11 o’clock I walk into town and find a Café where I can charge the phone, while studying the map and drinking coffee. After an hour the phone is charged and I set off out of town again. Even if I saw the trail sign I dully ignored it and just hiked down to the river, just to realize after a while that I lost the trail. Happily I found a dirt road which led into the right direction, and after some time of uncertainty I reach the trail again. At Lagnäset there’s a hanging bridge - though sadly it is closed. Claudia from the Bjurhom kummun later told me that there will be a new bridge coming in the future.</p>

<p>I follow the sign and soon hike up a slope which is like a yellow-golden tunnel of Birch-and-Rowan-Awesomeness. I utterly love the colourful forest around me and the kilometres go by just easily. I pass several huts and rest places to which roads lead, but the only person I saw that day was a woman picking berries just outside of Bjurholm. At Petnäset the river makes one of the most beautiful curves, something I tried to capture with my drone, but alas the high wind didn’t allow me to capture the frame I had in mind. Still, the underneath photo should give you an idea of how pretty it is!</p>

<p>The scenery now starts to get more civilized, just as the river. While the day before it ran through deep gorges and I felt at times like I’d be in Lapland or Alaska today the meandering curves and the closeness to fields make it feel closer to civilization. It’s a gradual and nice change, and I enjoy this new scenery. After the Petnäset Hut the river makes lots of curves, and a look on my watch tells me that I already have hiked close to 30 km.</p>

<p>As I’m hiking along the river on along a fine trail at once a small Elk arrives. It stands there, taking a good look at me and lets me take its photo, and then turns back into the forest where I also hear its mother. It’s a beautiful experience and gives me new power to reach Agnäs, which I do by 16 o’clock and after some 35 km. Alas, unless I’d like to stay another night at Agnäs Stugor, Agnäs doesn’t offer much in terms of scenic camp spots.</p>

<p>So onwards it is. I follow a bit of the Klangvägen trail and prompt lose the Öreälvsleden trail, and after some searching I find it again and follow its signs. By now I really feel the distance I have hiked already today, and just wish that I soon arrive at the Storforsen Hut. That, however, doesn’t happen until 18 o’clock and some 42+ km hiked. I drop my gear into the hut, which looks like it’s well visited, and go out and enjoy the spectacular sunset over the Storforsen rapids. After that it’s time for one of the tastiest Meals I have along, <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/real-turmat-chicken-curry-bf/?pid=10239">Chicken Curry from REAL Turmat</a>. I put some logs into the small stove inside and am amazed at how quickly it has heated up the hut - it’s so warm that I soon sit just in my boxer shorts inside, eating my tasty Dinner, looking forward to calling it a night!</p>

<p>The next morning rain is hitting the tin roof and I decide to sleep till 7 am. By the time I get out of my quilt the weather looks better and while the sky is grey it isn’t raining for the time being. I’m surprisingly feeling really good even after the Marathon distance of the previous day, and by 9 o’clock am packed up and hiking again - but before that I explore the Hanging Bridge and the rapids!</p>

<p>Less than four kilometres later I reach the Långholmarna Hut, and this was the last really nice hut along the trail - but this I didn’t know yet. I put down my pack and cleaned my feet in the river here - the water was easier to reach than up at the Storforsen Hut - and am wondering where I will sleep tonight.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/38085031481/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Green &amp; Red"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4452/38085031481_0cafccf233_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Green &amp; Red" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Shortly after the Långholmarna Hut I left the Bjurholm community and entered the Nordmaling community, and the difference was seen quite clearly: While there were well-established sections of trail on the southern part, there were also a lot of sections of trail where one was bush-whacking through chin-high undergrowth, searching for trail blazes and wondering if one was right, and generally the trail was not as well maintained as in the northern part. However, there were also very beautiful parts: High esker ridges which gave wide views across the landscape, colourful forests and pretty places along the river which were very inviting for a break!</p>

<p>I arrived around 16 o’clock at the very nice and new camping place of the tiny village Hummelholm, and just as I was sitting down in the fire shelter the heavens opened and it started to pour down like mad. I was happy that I was lucky enough to sit under a roof that moment, and I observed the rain from the shelter, waiting for it to stop. After 20 minutes the rain passed and I shouldered my pack again, and though I rather would have stayed right there as I already had hiked over 24 km I knew I needed to push on till Torrböle and the Lean-to there. I hiked on the street through Hummelholm and happily left the asphalt road behind at the end of the village. Here the trail was super-well maintained: Trail blazes in regular distances, little benches along the river, bridges and even duck boards over especially swampy sections. The trail released me into a scenic field and I knew that I now was close to my intended camping spot.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37375863944/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Fields"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4512/37375863944_4d714af688_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Fields" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>What I didn’t knew was that the signs for the trail in the tiny village of Torrböle were well hidden, and so I was searching for 45 Minutes for where the trail should continue, until I finally saw the right street and the bridge over the river. However, the confusion of signs and marks on the trees on the other side did cost me another 20 minutes until I finally found the lean-to shelter. Slightly annoyed I pitched the Hapi Sil, got water and built up a fire in the lean-to. I didn’t linger to long around the fire and soon went off to my shelter to catch some sweet dreams.</p>

<h2 id="final-section-to-the-baltic">Final Section to the Baltic</h2>

<p>I had some 25 km left until the end of the trail, and as I needed to still get to Nordmaling to catch a Bus back to Umeå I wanted to be well in time. As the birds started singing I was up, and by 8 o’clock I was back on the trail. Sadly the confusion of which direction to go was still the same as the day before, but after some bullish following of the compass bearing I found the trail. Along several nice rapids for packrafting and fishing I followed the river towards the Baltic, happy to reach it but also sad that my solo hike would soon be over.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long and the trail was following pretty much exclusively forest roads and even asphalt roads. There were some enjoyable sections of nice, narrow forest trails intertwined along the way, but of the 25 km I hiked that day over 20 km were on forest roads and asphalt roads. That made the hiking not very nice - I very much prefer soft forest paths or mountain trails for moving in nature. It was thus quite nice to finally reach the end of the trail in Alvik. I could see the Baltic in the distance, and after having hiked so many kilometres on roads my feet were hurting. I had luck, though - Claudia and her family were picking berries close by and would pick me up and give me a ride to the Bus and Railway Station in Nordmaling! So I got out of my shoes and enjoyed the feeling of gravel and grass, while looking on the river Öreälv and how it now slowly was reaching the end of its journey, a journey which I now had accompanied for 124 km from Örträsk till here!</p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that I highly recommend the Öreälvsleden trail. I enjoyed the wilderness of the northern part which is just a couple of hours away from Umeå, which makes it very easily accessible. I want to visit the trail again - and take my packraft this time! Hence I would recommend if you’d like to visit the trail to take a packraft and hike from around the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/B8dYU3S7eQ42">Tallbergsbroarna</a> North to Örträsk and then paddle back down - that way one can explore the best part of the Öreälvsleden Trail and one avoids the not so nice hiking on forest roads. If you’re into (fly) fishing you also should take a rod with you, as there’s lot of places along the river where you can try your luck. You can even order a permit via your cellphone!</p>

<p>Finally, make sure to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/sets/72157688561043576">check out the Flickr Album</a> with over 150 photos from along the trail to get an even better impression of it.</p>

<h2 id="getting-there-food--accommodation">Getting There, Food &amp; Accommodation</h2>

<p>To get to the start of the trail you’ll first need to <a href="https://www.visitumea.se/en/travel-to-umea">get to Umeå</a> - if you’re coming from Finland hop on the <a href="https://www.wasaline.com/en/">Wasaline Ferry</a> like me and enjoy the scenary on deck when the weather is good. From Umeå you can take either a Bus to Bjurholm or Agnäs to spend a night indoors before you hit the trail, or head directly to Örträsk and camp at the lake or at the Floaters Dam. <a href="https://reseplanerare.resrobot.se/index.html">Resrobot</a> helps you plan the trip with public transportation to the start of the trail and back to Umeå when you have reached the Baltic.</p>

<p>In Umeå I slept at the YMCA Hostel which I can not endorse this time (unlike previous times, when it has been fine). I’d recommend finding a nice <a href="www.airbnb.com/c/hmorkel">AirBnB</a> or stay at one of the <a href="https://www.visitumea.se/en/stay">Hotels</a> in the city. I ate at <a href="http://vezzo.se">Vezzo</a> and it was DELICIOUS, the Calzone and the Goat-cheese Salad are highly recommended and they also have some tasty local beers on tap. There’s other nice places around, best is you use Tripadvisor when in town to find something which suits your wants.</p>

<p>There’s a Swedish language Hiking and Fishing Map of the complete trail, but it isn’t very detailed and also slightly outdated.

For more Infos on the trail visit the <a href="https://www.visitumea.se/fi/varaa/tehtava/a475875/vandra_langs_orealven__475875/showdetails?filter=c%3D24264">Öreälven River Trail website</a>.</p>

<p>Because of the camera gear, drone and the forecasted rain I opted to use the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/arcteryx-bora-ar-50-backpack-trekking-backpack/?pid=10239">Arc’teryx Bora AR 50 Backpack</a> because it was slightly larger in volume than the Osprey Levity 45 which I planned on using. I slept under the Vaude Alpstein 450 quilt on my trusty <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/therm-a-rest-neoair-xtherm.html">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XTherm</a>. I slept one night in the <a href="http://locusgear.com/items/hapi-sil/?lang=en">Locus Gear Hapi Sil</a> and had the <a href="http://www.rutalocura.com/trekking_poles.html">Ruta Locura Yana Poles</a> along, water was boiled with the <a href="http://bit.ly/2xKSMG0">Jetboil MicroMo</a>. I used the <a href="http://bit.ly/2z2OFsC">La Sportiva Akyra</a> for the first time and they were OK, as it was very rainy the shoes stayed wet from start to finish (never mind the 10 minutes the first two mornings where I managed to dry them a wee bit). Other gear were tried &amp; trusted favourites: The <a href="http://bit.ly/2fij250">Arc’teryx Satoro AR Zip Top</a> as a long-sleeve, over which I wore the <a href="http://amzn.to/2dO11Gm">Black Diamond Coefficient Vest</a> or a <a href="http://bit.ly/2jQ9i4U">Arc’teryx Proton LT Hoody</a>. I mostly wore the <a href="http://bit.ly/2wawi0l">Houdini Aegis Jacket</a> over all those, and on my legs there were the <a href="http://bit.ly/2fiiGer">Arc’teryx Gamma Rock Pants</a> while on my head there was the well-used <a href="http://bit.ly/2dZuBfn">Arc’teryx Neutro Visor</a> and the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/06/julbo-trek-zebra.html">Julbo Trek Sunglasses</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wilderness in the middle of Sweden, just an hour away from Umeå? Yes, on the beautiful Öreälvsleden trail! I just returned from Sweden and want to share some first impressions with you about this unknown pearl of a hiking trail!</p>

<p>Four days, 124 km, great infrastructure, beautiful autumn colours and a wild river in Sweden - the <a href="https://www.visitumea.se/en/book/to-do/a475875/vandra_langs_orealven__475875/showdetails">Öreälvsleden</a> is a trail that rewards. While I go through the thousands of photos I took during my hike and edit the video here’s some first impressions from this beautiful trail in Västerbotten, Sweden.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37305380575/in/dateposted/" title="Start of the trail!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4441/37305380575_55f457cb81_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Start of the trail!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The start of the trail for me, just a bit outside of Örträsk. Skin-out weight: Too heavy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36490828393/in/dateposted/" title="Instagram Stories along the way in real time!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4384/36490828393_e8a758bf0a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Instagram Stories along the way in real time!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If you <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">followed me on Instagram</a> you could see my Stories Live from the Trail =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37305376695/in/dateposted/" title="The Öreälv river"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4332/37305376695_078fc224cc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Öreälv river" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A perfect packrafting river, I made the stupid last-minute decision to not take the packraft. Next time I won’t make that mistake!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37113685196/in/dateposted/" title="Autumn Colours!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4430/37113685196_c7bee1288c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Autumn Colours!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The autumn colours were sublime.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37131733892/in/dateposted/" title="Lingonberries"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4404/37131733892_09f9285b1e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lingonberries" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Lingonberries were ripe and plentiful.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37113686836/in/dateposted/" title="Tasty Dinner!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4368/37113686836_bb40866c97_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tasty Dinner!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There was tasty food in the evenings.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37131735552/in/dateposted/" title="Camping out!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4423/37131735552_1cd52664ff_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Camping out!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Hapi Sil was pitched.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37305414365/in/dateposted/" title="Sunshine in the Pine Forest"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4420/37305414365_779cf3ff77_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunshine in the Pine Forest" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There was sunshine here and there.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37161738121/in/dateposted/" title="Field ripe for reaping"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4416/37161738121_8f5c242542_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Field ripe for reaping" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Towards the south the trail became more civilized and I hiked between fields and the river.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37113703346/in/dateposted/" title="Håknäs Sågverk"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4408/37113703346_f745198df2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Håknäs Sågverk" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And passed through lovely little Swedish villages.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37131735832/in/dateposted/" title="Tasty post-hike Dinner!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4379/37131735832_98cafffa6e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tasty post-hike Dinner!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And I rewarded myself with a delicious Calzone, Goat-cheese Salad and Beer back in Umeå!</p>

<p>The full trip-report including details on logistics et al. comes next week, until then I hope you enjoyed these first impressions from the Öreälvsleden trails - and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">follow me on Instagram</a> to see more of it!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Högakustenleden - or High Coast Trail in English - is a new trail that passes through the UNESCO World Heritage site of the same name. The scenic trail passes through villages &amp; towns, along the coast, through the forest and a beautiful National Park and if you have a free week makes for a great walk along the Swedish coastal hills.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16034082038" title="Jon Nils Berget is the highest point on the trail by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7571/16034082038_6e226a048a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Jon Nils Berget is the highest point on the trail" /></a></p>

<p>November marks usually the last month of the year where I go out on a Press Trip to do research for <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/magazines/">magazine</a> articles. It’s far from the perfect backpacking month in the North and I had planned to hike the High Coast Trail in August, but changes in schedules meant it’d be the final backpacking trip of the year. Happily my good friend Martin agreed to accompany me, and so we met up late on a Sunday night in a <a href="http://umea.kfum.se">Hostel in Umeå</a>, him after flying in, me after taking the <a href="http://www.wasaline.com">ferry from Vaasa</a>. The next morning we enjoyed the breakfast at the Hostel and walked to the bus station from where we had a comfortable and fast bus ride to the bus stop at Hornöberget just before the High Coast Bridge, the start point of the trail.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16221689035" title="Start at the High Coast Bridge in Hornöberget by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7551/16221689035_e5fb4a7ab7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Start at the High Coast Bridge in Hornöberget" /></a></p>

<p>We followed the street for a bit, took to a forest road and soon saw our first Högakustenleden trail marker and were on a proper trail. It was a short one, though, because the next several kilometres took us along on village roads, along the street, across bridges until we finally walked along the Baltic Sea and came upon a proper trail into the forest. It wasn’t all pleasurable forest trails, though, we also passed a few deforested areas until we finally reached Sör-Lövvik, the end of section 1. The <a href="http://lovvikbedandbreakfast.se">Lövvik B&amp;B</a> looked inviting just along the trail, and while it was still early in the day we somehow wouldn’t have minded to stop there or at the free cottage in the village, but as it was closed for the winter we just continued until Fjärdbotten.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15601850203" title="Fishing Nets by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7503/15601850203_bcabd0086a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Fishing Nets" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16035884247" title="On streets by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7487/16035884247_65a120cd5d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="On streets" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16195855506" title="And trail markers to keep us on course by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7542/16195855506_1793df18c3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="And trail markers to keep us on course" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16219888711" title="A B&amp;B in Lövvik by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7575/16219888711_bd1004d1a8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="A B&amp;B in Lövvik" /></a></p>

<p>We hiked for a while along the road and then took a turn onto a forest path. We found a stream to refill our water bottles and continued until the Laavu at Halsviken Bay. The place looked nice, and with dusk upon us we yet again were tempted to put the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/hyperlite-mountain-gear-ultamid.html">HMG UltaMid</a> up for the night. We resisted the early finish and continued on the trail, which then went through a boulder field along the shore. Sleet from the sky, strong winds and spray from the sea make walking on boulders a pleasurable past time, which only can be improved by onsetting darkness. We somehow managed to no break any feet or legs and were rather happy as we reached the forest road and road to Fjärdbotten. It was dark and raining as we arrived there, not knowing what to expect.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16035659269" title="Boulder-hoping in the dark and rain by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7546/16035659269_bb0576bfb7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Boulder-hoping in the dark and rain" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16034258558" title="Night Selfie by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8603/16034258558_8d5ccdb6a3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Night Selfie" /></a></p>

<p>Fjärdbotten was a great camping place. Around six wooden cottages with tables, benches, beds and some with a stove in them were too good a chance to pass up. Martin quickly put a clothes line up, we hang our wet gear up to dry, got a fire started and then the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/primus-eta-lite-gaskocher/">Primus Lite+</a> came out and boiled us hot water for dinners and Minttu Kakaos! Well fed we soon dived into our sleeping bags and had a good night’s sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning was drizzly but looked like it might clear up. After we explored the Fjärdbotten summer farm and checked out the other cottages and got water from the well we had a warm breakfast &amp; coffee, boiled water for our <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/11/thermos-bottle.html">Thermos</a> and then soon were out on the trail again. The decision to stay at Fjärdbotten was a good one, and it was a very nice place.</p>

<p>The next section took us on the highest point along the trail, Jon Nils Berget. We were lucky as the drizzle from the morning stopped after a few kilometres of hiking and we were treated by one of those fine, sunny days which you get after a night of rain. The trail was a mix of nice forest roads (they’re great to walk and talk on with a party of two!) where abandoned caravans were every few kilometres. As we reached Jon Nils Berget the sun came out and we really enjoyed this beautiful moment.</p>

<p>We had a quick tea and cookies break at the Nipstugan on Lidenipan, and the sun just continued to treat us with warmth and light on the way to Gavik, the end of the 3rd Section. Behind Gavik we hiked on a forest road along summer cottages which had been closed up for winter, and had a very late lunch as the sun was just setting somewhere in the West. Soon the headlamps came on as we hiked on dark and wet forest trails and snowy forest roads.</p>

<p>The goal of Section 4 was Lappuden, which was hailed as <em>the</em> camping spot along the Högakustenleden. Well, it was not. As it was closed. Closed up for winter. After the luxury of the Fjärdbotten hut we were going to sleep outside, and as the lake and grass fields already were covered with thin ice we knew we’d be in for a cold night. Alas, not even a fire we were able to lighten up, for a lack of wood and a fire place. We still had a good night, even if my <a href="http://www.phdesigns.co.uk">PHD Minix Sleeping Bag</a> was a tad too less insulation for these temperatures. The next morning the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/garmin-fenix.html">fēnix</a> said -3°C and we packed up while the Lite+ boiled water for breakfast &amp; coffee. We were early on the trail again, and we were happy to leave the disappointment of Lappuden behind.</p>

<p>The trail was again a mix of enjoyable forest trails, OK forest roads and less enjoyable asphalt streets, but happily the trails made up the majority os Section 5 to Ullånger. The highlight for Martin and me was the beautiful Erikskojan hut high up in the middle of the forest. It stood lonely there, and if I hadn’t pulled like someone who really wants to sit inside with his tea we probably would have drunk our hot tea on its steps as the door was very tightly closed =) Of all the huts we passed this was the one we both really would have loved to stay in for the night, as it was cozy and comfortable. Alas, we needed to continue onwards.</p>

<p>As we hiked into Ullånger it was still lunch time, and we didn’t need long to decide on the Värdshuset Restaurang Snäckan to get our business. A Lunch Buffet is a Hiker’s dream, and tasty Swedish food was consumed in large amounts, topped off with coffee and cookies. It was fortunate that we didn’t need to hike a long distance to our next camping place, the Gårdberget Stugan just above Ullånger. We didn’t really know what to expect, but were delighted by the hut, which was decorated in a 70s style and had a big stove inside. A fire was roaring quickly while night fell, and we enjoyed the evening by talking and drinking a good Whisky.</p>

<p>The night over a powdery coat of snow covered the land and we enjoyed the walk in the morning through the silent forest. That silence was interrupted the closer we got to Sjöland and Skoved as the trail went along the highway. It was an interesting experience to hike with trucks and cars passing by at high speeds, and I do hope that the trail finds a different route in the future.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16262738312" title="Church door by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7555/16262738312_90e05236cb_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Church door" /></a>

<p>We flew through Section 7 from Skoved to Skuleberget and the <a href="http://www.naturumhogakusten.se/">Naturum Höga Kusten</a> Centre. Sadly the Museum also was closed, and as we still had well over 15 km before us we also didn’t take the detour over the top of the Skuleberget. The hill was impressive, though, and it’s nice to see that local entrepreneurs have installed Via Ferratas on it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15643755233" title="Naturum Höga Kusten by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7561/15643755233_c0fd06d8dd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Naturum Höga Kusten" /></a>

<p>Section 8 from Skuleberget to the Skuleberget National Park South Entry must have been one of the most frustrating ones on the trail. After the Naturum Höga Kusten Centre we had another quick lunch break outside and then followed the nice Kids Adventure/ Robber Trail, passed an Open Air Theatre and then crossed the highway once more to hike on trails and forest roads to the South Entry of the National Park. Some sections of the trail were flooded and it was impossible to keep your feet dry, which usually doesn’t bother me at all, but somehow that day it really annoyed me a lot. The trail wasn’t fun in the wet dirt &amp; mud, but happily I recovered as soon as the trail became dry again. As we came closer and closer to the Skuleberget National Park the better our moods got, and the view from the South Entry was indeed well worth coming there.</p>

<p>As frustrating as that wet part of the trail previously was, so wonderful was the <a href="http://www.sverigesnationalparker.se/skuleskogen#.VLUOe8bJhJc">Skuleskogen National Park</a>. The National Park probably was the highlight of our trip, and we were a bit sad that we spend only such a short time in day light in it. We hiked on duck boards for kilometres, passed waterfalls and then hiked up to the impressive Slåttdalsskrevan, a 200 m long, 40 m deep and 7 m wide crevice. We explored it in the shine of our headlamps and then made us on the way down to the Tärnättvattnen Stuga in the middle of the National Park.</p>

<p>The hut was gorgeous from the inside and outside, though as it often happens with such huts, they seem to accumulate rubbish and trinkets which previous visitors <em>left for others to enjoy</em> or simply <em>forgot</em>. We cleaned up, got a fire started and enjoyed the evening with the a <em>Feierabendbier</em> which we carried all the way from the Supermarket in Docksta till here to enjoy in this rustic hut. The next morning grey clouds still hung thickly in the sky and the sun wasn’t to be seen. We brought some more wood for the next visitors to the hut, cleaned up and packed and where on our way again.</p>

<p>The way out of the National Park was again very beautiful, along frozen lakes, via Duckboards over swamps, over small streams and soft forest trails until the North Entry.</p>

<p>It was noon as we arrived in Köpmanholmen, and as every good tourist hiker does we immediately located the local Pizzeria and ordered their lunch Pizza. 60 SEK for a Pizza, salad, drink and coffee is a real bargain, especially considering that the Pizzas were about 40 cm (!) in diameter. We were stuffed as we walked out of the village and walked on a sandy road until the where we would enter the Balesudden Nature Reserve. It was a very beautiful reserve and not even a kilometre from the start of the forest trail we passed the prettiest Laavu on the whole Högakustenleden, up on the hill overlooking the Baltic Sea. Again we regretted that we needed to push on and couldn’t stay here, as the view and atmosphere was gorgeous.</p>

<p>Instead we pushed on through on and up through the Balesudden Nature Reserve, though with dusk coming upon us and a light drizzle we had our eyes mostly on the slippery trail in front of us. We passed a nice fireplace and camping spot near a bay until we happened upon the Bodviken Stugan, our hut for the night. The drizzle had become rain and I was happy as Martin offered to go chop the wood. I started the fire and rolled out my sleeping bag and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite.html">mattress</a> and again fired up the Primus Lite+. Soon we were well fed and had a whisky in our cups, which ensured we had another good, relaxed and warm night.</p>

<p>In winter you can sleep long and still catch the sunrise. So after we had breakfast I took a little stroll around the hut to photograph the sunrise. It was just a brief moment where one could spot the sun, as it passed up from the sea to hide again behind the clouds. It was our last day on the trail, and we only had 21 km till Örnsköldsvik, with the last part in civilization, so that we took it easy. We passed a few more Laavus in the morning, hiked on forest roads and streets, up hills and had a quick break in the Småtjärnstugan, and then were very quickly in Svedje, the end of Section 12.</p>

<p>From here we passed through the town and climbed the local recreation area. As it was windy, 0°C and grey we just marched on towards Örnsköldsvik, the end of Section 13 of the Högakustenleden. Early in the afternoon we reached town. Done.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16076823010" title="Örnskoldvik by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7566/16076823010_6ce886089b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Örnskoldvik" /></a>

<p>While standing on the square in the centre a young Swede came talking to us, who recognized me as <em>the writer of Hiking in Finland</em>. It was a fun coincidence as he said he saw that we’d be hiking the trail that week and he met us just as we finished! Very cool! After inquiring about a good place to eat in the evening we walked to our hostel, <a href="http://www.vindarnashus.se">Vindarnas Hus</a>. It was a nice &amp; quiet hostel with Wifi, hot showers and good beds, and we chilled there in the evening until we headed out to eat at <a href="http://www.bishopsarms.com/Ornskoldsvik">The Bishops Arms</a> which not only had superb food but also impeccable service and great beers. It was a worthy finish to a great Högakustenleden thru-hike!</p>

<p>The funniest thing about the Högakustenleden was for Martin and me how the distances were way off from what the signs and the guide booklet said. It makes me wonder if the trail is actually hiked by the people who planned it and if they made the effort to check the distance, or if these were just made via some mapping tool. Because the Högakustenleden is supposed to be 128,6 km from Hornöberget to Örnsköldsvik, but I tracked with my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/garmin-fenix.html">Garmin fēnix</a> 141,8 km in the six days we hiked it. This isn’t uncommon and I regularly hike trails and sections which are longer/ shorter than they’re claimed to be, but still is something to keep in mind when you plan to hike the trail.</p>

<p>Also important to know is that the trail goes quite a bit along forest roads and streets. It does feel like at least 50% of the trail makes use of such infrastructure, and while it can make for fast hiking (5 km an hour and easy to chat while walking next to each other) it isn’t really very inspiring. Happily there are enough of nice forest trails, too, and the section through the Skuleskogen National Park was gorgeous. If you have time I’d recommend planning a day to just explore the National Park and then hike on.</p>

<p>Plan the travel there and back via <a href="http://reseplanerare.resrobot.se/bin/help.exe/sn?L=vs_resrobot&amp;tpl=webapp">Resrobot</a>, one of the best travel apps I have used. It helps you to find the best Bus/ Train/ Flight connections from e.g. Stockholm to Hornöberget and Örnsköldsvik and also lets you book the tickets right away.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.visitsweden.com/sweden/">Visit Sweden</a> and the <a href="http://www.hogakustenleden.com">Högakustenleden</a> + <a href="http://hogakusten.com/en/hk/high-coast-trail.html">High Coast Trail</a> websites offer a host of information about Sweden and the trail, especially the last page has a great overview map and a description of each section. You can order from there also the useful <a href="http://hogakusten.com/information/en/brochures.html">Trail Guide</a>, though don’t bother with the (free) map as it’s too large a scale to be useful for hiking. Speaking of maps, you really can hike it just with the maps in the Trail Guide. The trail is exceptionally well marked and so very beginner-friendly, sometimes every third tree has an orange dot or stripe.</p>

<p>We slept every night in one of the free huts or Laavus and were completely alone on the trail, we once encountered day hikers. But then we were hiking in November, so in the spring, summer and autumn that could look very differently. I recommend you take a <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">shelter</a> along when hiking in those months, or make use of the various accommodation options along the trail. Basic ultralight gear choices would suit the trail well, you can practice pitching tarps and sleeping with a quilt here very well as you could always head to one of the Laavus or Huts. From Ullånger on you almost daily would pass a village with a supermarket, Café and Restaurant, so you could easily resupply along the trail (or buy a Swedish Beer for the evening each day =).</p>

<p>Along the trail you also could easily go packrafting, sea kayaking, climbing and Via Ferrata. While you could do some of these activities just besides the trail you’d need to plan an extra day for some others. Because of the good infrastructure (huts &amp; Laavus, Restaurants and Shops along the way) the trail could be a good choice for families who want to try backpacking with their kids.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s a long, boring ride from Vaasa to Abisko: 1.000 km of asphalt, past dozens of speed traps, trees, lakes and the Gulf of Botnia. Just the last hour, from Kiruna onwards, is interesting, and gets you in the mood for mountains, ice climbing, and making new friends at the northern-most ice climbing festival of the world.</p>

<p><strong>Vaasa, Wednesday afternoon, grey sky, +1°C</strong>. An academic quarter means being 15 minutes late. As Andreas is a student, it was thus just normal that he adhered to the academic quarter when he picked me up on Wednesday afternoon. Packs were loaded in the trunk, seats adjusted, and then we were the kings of the road. Before us lay roughly 600 km of riding till Rovaniemi. Even with good company, music and the roads in good conditions the ride to the gateway to Lapland takes so much time, that we were happy when we arrived past eleven in Rollo. A quick beer with our host Chris and it was off to bed.</p>

<p><strong>Rovaniemi, Thursday morning, grey sky, 0°C</strong>. As I silently get up at seven the next morning Chris, our host, is already up. <em>Coffee?</em>. Sure. We drink and talk at his kitchen table and lament the lack of good winter this year. <em>In the past everything was better</em>, that is how it must sound to people a generation younger than us. Andreas and me pack up our stuff and drive to Prisma, where we meet the third Musketeer for this journey: <a href="https://twitter.com/aleksimehtonen">Aleksi</a>. A few last groceries are purchased, another coffee is drunk, and we commence to the car. The ride out of Rovaniemi and into the north is as spectacular as leaving any other city, and the grey weather does not help to improve this feeling. It’s an hour drive to Pello where we cross into Sweden.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13083701395/" title="Road by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7375/13083701395_b598697d56_b.jpg" width="1024" height="540" alt="Road" /></a></p>

<p>I gotta hand it to the Swedes, they at least know how to make the journey more interesting. The road from Pello onwards is going almost constantly along a wide river, which in the summer would be a superb packrafting adventure. Now, it at least makes for a slightly more interesting sight. In the middle of nowhere we stop and eat one of the best pea soups ever, and a set of pancakes to satisfy the sweet tooth. Another cup of dark coffee, and we’re on the road again. We pass Kiruna, the mining town that will be moved completely in the next twenty years, and steering the car north we can see the fjells of Sweden. The sun is breaking through in the distance, immersing the distant hills in a spectral light. The closer we come to our destination, the higher the fjells become, and from the road we already see many beautiful lines of ice going up.</p>

<p><strong>Abisko Canyon, Thursday afternoon, grey sky, -2°C</strong>. Merja from the <a href="http://www.arcticguides.com/">Arctic Guides</a> welcomes us to the festival, hands out Festival Passes and lets us know where to find everything. We bring our gear to the Nuolja Ski Hut, where we will be staying that night, dress up in our ice climbing clothes and head down to the canyon. On the way down I meet <a href="http://www.said-belhaj.com/">Said Belhaj</a> and we chat a bit. Down in the canyon, where already a few participants are whacking ice, Said asks if I’d like to belay him. <em>Sure</em>. Even if Said is more at home on the 8b routes of the world, he does climb ice just as well. It’s a good example that a good rock climber should have no problems translating his skills to ice. This becomes even more evident when Said tackles the vertical mixed route, which he climbs without problems with crampons and ice axes being natural extensions of his body.</p>

<p><strong>Abisko STF Mountain Station, Friday morning, blue sky, -2°C</strong>. I open the curtains in our room and can’t believe that the weather forecast is wrong. Nuolja stands against a blue sky, and the first rays of sun are touching its top. The breakfast buffet at the <a href="http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/en/Discover-Sweden/Facilities-and-activities/Lappland/Fjallstationer/STF-Mountain-station-Abisko/">Abisko STF Mountain Station</a> is worth a visit alone, and after a healthy dose of rye bread, bacon, cheese and scrambled eggs our small group packs our lunches and head out to the cars, which bring us to the first clinic, <em>Efficient multi pitch climbing on ice</em>. <a href="http://www.vertikalguiden.se/concrete/">Stefan</a> and <a href="http://www.arcticguides.com/">Martin</a> show us how it’s done, answer our questions, and then let us lose on the ice.</p>

<p>I tie in with Jon, who works at the mines in Kiruna and came up to Abisko for the day. We take turns on the low ice walls establishing belays, belaying the second, and then climbing onwards. After several tries we feel we are ready to tackle on of the larger walls, but first we refuel with hot coffee, sandwiches and chocolate. In between sips of steaming coffee we chat, revealing and hearing more bout our climbing partner. It’s a reoccuring thing on these happenings, and I probably told <em>“My Story”</em> a dozen times over the weekend, and have heard just as many different interesting stories in return. It’s fascinating and the beauty of this happening, which brings people with a common interest to a magnificent place and lets them tie in and whack ice together.</p>

<p>Now knowing more about each other, Jon and I give a higher wall a try. I try to go first, but half-way between our supposed belay spot and the ground confidence leaves and I climb back down. Jon takes the lead, establishes a belay and I climb up. While it feels like we’re climbing the Mont Blanc du Tacul route we’re hanging a mere five meters above the ground, and energy leaves. While I’d now feel confident to go for the top, Jon suggests we take a break and then continue. I rappel down, Jon follows, another bread &amp; cuppa and we are back. This time Jon climbs the whole line and belays me from the top, while I clean the route. We high five on top of the cliff, and realize that we’re the last ones here. Anna waits with the shuttle bus at the road and smiles to us - <em>“Take your time!”</em>. We walk off the cliff, pack up, and ride back to the station. Beer time. Sauna time. Dinner time. Presentation time. Northern Lights. Sleeping time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13084146604/" title="Aurora Borealis by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3758/13084146604_f3c1d7042d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Aurora Borealis" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Abisko STF Mountain Station, Saturday morning, blue sky, -3°C</strong>. With the heating up in our cozy room it was too hot for me. Aleksi and me head together with Torbjörn &amp; Robert from Sweden up to the breakfast buffet. The talk goes to past adventures and future plans, but today we look forward to building abalakov and different belay stations before heading up to Nuolja. At <em>Kurva</em> Stefan teaches us again, and I’m glad we have such experienced and friendly instructors here at the Festival, who are happy to loan you their personal gear and answer your questions, even if they’ve answered the same thing already five times that day. We build different belays, which even at 20 cm above the ground gets the sweat flowing - especially if you forget to take off your down jacket. Building an abalakov is always exciting, and I’m happy as mine works on the first try. Then things go fast.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13083875035/" title="Abalakov clinic by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7428/13083875035_9797ee2d6c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Abalakov clinic" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Nuolja, Saturday afternoon, blue sky, -2°C</strong>. The hike up to Nuolja is more strenous as expected, and 40 minutes later our little group stands below the cliff. While some set off to lead, others are waiting for the top rope to be set up. And while I’d feel confident enough to climb one of those WI3 slabs, all the lines are taken. Done with setting up the TR Stefan comes down and inquires what I’d like to do. <em>A lead climb would be nice</em> I reply. <em>Lets go and see the fall to the right</em>. Stefan, Andreas and me walk on the 50° hard snow to the base of the climb, and standing in front of it I see that this is closer to WI4, even if it’s relatively short with just 20 meters. <em>You lead, we second?</em> I suggest. <em>OK</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13083804033/" title="Nuolja by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2147/13083804033_036382b0f1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="408" alt="Nuolja" /></a></p>

<p>It’s a proper alpine adventure route, with lots and lots of snow, and topping out on top felt great. I walk a tad further up and coil my rope while Andreas climbs up. The helicopter which flew the other group to Kaisepakte flys by and snaps photos of us on top, and with Andreas on top we stroll to the rappel anker. As we wait for our turn to rappel down Torbjörn just tops out on his first lead climb, exhilarated about the achievement. On the way down I see Robert make the final moves to the top, and am happy for the two to have succeed on their first lead route.</p>

<p><strong>Abisko STF Mountain Station, Saturday evening, clear sky, -4°C</strong>. Hiking back to the road, Sara just pulls up to the parking lot as I arrive. We catch up while the others slowly come down from the mountain, and then we head back to the STF Mountain Station, where the Drytooling Competition is just about to start. Stefan, David and the Arctic Guide Team have built a sweet rig for us to compete on. Hang from the wooden block without touching the ground - the rules are simple, but even in the qualifying round some already fail. It’s the next round, with the wooden block moved further away, that sees only five succeed, and so the final is a thrilling event, and at the end we have one winner. After a quick shower and changing clothes the Festival Dinner starts. We’re treated to a three course meal which lets us taste some Swedish delicacies, which are accompanied by glasses of wine and beer. The mood is cheerful, everyone had a great day and got some good climbing in, and slowly we stroll to the After Lounge Bar, where Said treats us to a presentation about his 20 years as a climber. It’s a great story, filled with places and names which will demand the attention of any climber, communicated in Said’s friendly, down-to-earth way. Accompanied by good tunes we travel the globe from one great climbing destination to the next, and after Said plays the Digeridoo to finish off a long applause commences. On the way to the ski hut, more Northern Lights dance across the fjells and the lake, while the stars glow in the dark firmament.</p>

<p><strong>Abisko Canyon, Sunday morning, clear sky, -2°C</strong>. Also on the third day the Breakfast Buffet offers new tastes to explore, though the favouries of bacon, eggs and cheese on dark rye bread couldn’t be missed. We descent to the Abisko Canyon, where a clinic of Traditional Scottish Mixed is on the schedule. Stefan, who has over 20 years of experience of climbing mixed - often in underground caves in central Sweden - shows our little group the ins and outs, before we eagerly tie in the Top Ropes to try climbing with our tools and crampon on the rocks. The fun ends just too quickly, as I head back up to the sun to interview Anders for an article I’m writing for the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/trekking-magazin/">trekking Magazin</a>. Slowly also Aleksi and Andreas come up to the sun, after having enjoyed more Mixed &amp; Ice climbing, and we pack up the last bit of our gear to bring it to the car. It’s noon and the sun shines down on Lapporten, the gate to the Kungsleden, as we say our good byes to new and old friends. Another long ride is in front of us, but we’re certain we will return to the friends and ice of Abisko in the future.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In three weeks the second <a href="http://www.arcticguides.com/events">Abisko Ice Climbing Festival</a> kicks off, and it’s set to be pretty amazing again. In case you’re still on the edge about going - I will give you plenty of good reasons to travel to the northern most Ice Climbing Festival!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8553149630/" title="Lapporten ice climbing"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8380/8553149630_34b8f7fee8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Lapporten" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2013-experiences.html">Last year’s AICF</a> was fantastic and I learned a lot. It’s not every day that you can pick the brains of Alpinists like Robert Jasper and the guys from Petzl, so as the 2nd AICF was announced, with a pretty fantastic line-up of instructors and clinics, it was an easy decision to travel north to Abisko this year again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8553049416/" title="Canyon by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/8553049416_5a073d5199_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Canyon" /></a></p>

<p>Like last year, the AICF is something for everyone: From the complete novice who has never climbed ice to advanced climbers, who want to hone their skills. You can loan all the ice climbing gear, and will be very well instructed on its use and technique. Accommodation is in the very nice <a href="http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/upptack/Omraden/Lappland/Fjallstationer/STF-Abisko-Turiststation/">STF Turiststation Abisko</a>, and if you travel with the family: There’s plenty to do there for kids and partners, from sledging and snowshoe walks to skiing and watching Aurora Borealis.</p>

<p>For the climbing, this year’s clinics include <em>Traditional Scottish mix lead</em>, <em>Efficient multi pitch</em>, <em>Basic Ice/Mix</em> as well as <em>Efficient and safe belay</em> and <em>Ice strength/ belay/ rappel/ abalakov</em>. There’s going to be a competition, the relaxed After Climb sessions, and which is surely going to be spectacular, the “Petzl night with Said Belhaj”. Said had just a big feature in the current Rock &amp; Ice 216 (great read, go get the Magazin!), and I met him briefly last year at the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2013/">Outdoor</a> so am very much looking forward to climbing with him. But there’s more, Stefan Lindblom and Krister Jonsson as well as UIAGM Mountain Guide &amp; Organizer Anders Bergwall are again along to teach you about proper crampon &amp; tool techniques, and show you how multi-pitch climbing is done well. And they’ll let you pick their brains from years of climbing on ice and mixed and other outdoor shenanigans!</p>

<p>As you see, there’s really plenty for everyone, and the four days surely will fly by way too fast. You can read all the details on the <a href="http://www.arcticguides.com/events">Arctic Guides</a> website, and then it’s time to <a href="http://www.arcticguides.com/wp-system/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AICF-2014-Prices.pdf">book your festival pass</a> and plan the trip north! You can also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AbiskoIceClimbingFestival">follow on Facebook</a> and keep an eye on the new <a href="http://www.abiskoiceclimbing.com/">Abisko Ice Climbing</a> website which will launch soon. See you in Absiko!</p>

<p><em>If you’re coming from Finland, we still have one seat free in the car from Vaasa (via a night in Rovaniemi on the way up), if you want to drive with us - <a href="mailto:hendrik@hikinginfinland.com">be in touch</a>!</em></p>
