<p>My son and me were in Lapland in February, by now already something of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/02/father-son-ski-trip.html">a little tradition</a> for us two. It‚Äôs a great way to bond, talk, have fun together and experience the beauty of our home country. I this case we went to <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/fi/">Saariselk√§</a>, a small village in the North-East of Finland, which I have <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/10/mountainbiking-in-lapland.html">visited</a> <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/urho-kekkonen-national-park.html">numerous</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/-AYVkZf61UE">times</a> over the past years as it‚Äôs located very close to several National Parks, Wilderness areas and is simply a great starting point for outdoor adventures. While we were hiking and skiing in Saariselk√§ also this time, we went on three different <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/open-fell-biking/">Fatbike rides in Saariselk√§ and Kiilop√§√§</a>. As our family are cycling enthusiasts - we still don‚Äôt own a car! - trying out Fatbikes was something that my son and me both looked forward too!</p>

<h2 id="fatbiking-in-kiilop-and-urho-kekkonen-nationalpark">Fatbiking in Kiilop√§√§ and Urho Kekkonen Nationalpark</h2>

<p>Our first trip was with Tuija from the <a href="http://openfellbiking.com/">MTB Project</a> and Raili from <a href="https://www.rolloutdoors.com/fi/kiilopaa/">Roll Outdoors</a>. These two women were fantastic guides and showed us the best and most scenic trails around Kiilop√§√§, and they even organized some glorious weather for us as you can see in the photos ‚òÄÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏èüòé My son and me took the Ski Bus from Saariselk√§ to Kiilop√§√§, a short 20 minute ride which takes you through the beautiful landscape. We met Raili and Tuija at the Roll Outdoors HQ and picked up our Fatbikes: They have e-Fatbikes, Kids Fatbikes, and the Canyon Dude 8.0 Fatbike which we rode. After a short introduction to the bikes and the plan for the day we started to ride through the Gates of the Urho Kekkonen National Park, and headed along the border of the National Park towards the Kiilop√§√§ Snow Bike Park, a good area to get familiar with the bikes in easy terrain and to see what they are capable off. The trails were freshly groomed and it was great riding on these fine trails.</p>

<p>The trails are well marked, and you can get a map to see where you are allowed to ride. Not all trails are allowed for Fatbikes - as tempting as it is to ride on the hard, flat XC Skiing trails: These are off-limits! There are over 50 km of Fatbike Trails, either pure bike trails or then open to both hikers and cyclists. We did encounter on our rides just a handful of hikers, who were always very friendly and excited to see us. Just make sure to slow down or even get off when you pass people, and all can use these trails together happily! We had a short break at the bottom of the Snow Bike Park at a Laavu, and then cycled a different route back to Kiilop√§√§, where we made a proper lunch break.</p>

<p>After good coffee and hot juice, tasty vegan food and chocolate bananas we rode the trail up to Ahonp√§√§t. The views from the trail - we were there right at the Golden Hour, which always gets me a bit excited and I have the urge to just stop every 100 m and take photos üòÜ - were breath-taking. Not just because of the long up-hill, but also because of the magnificent views.</p>

<p>The trees were absolutely beautiful, fully hiding beneath the snow, a warm, golden light was making everything look beautiful and all four of us were just smiling from ear to ear. A moment to remember.</p>

<p>After all the uphill it was time to turn the Fatbikes around and point our tires down and back to Kiilop√§√§! Timo, the <a href="https://www.pallasyllasoutdoors.com">local trail builder</a>, has created a wonderfully flow-trail which gives you great views while you descent. You should <a href="https://youtu.be/WRvGZ18se0o">watch the video</a> to see what I mean, the photos simply don‚Äôt do it justice of how beautiful this trail is!</p>

<p>Happy, and a wee bit cold, we arrived back at the Roll Outdoors Shop in Kiilop√§√§, and went inside of the <a href="https://www.kiilopaa.fi">Suomen Latu</a> building to have a hot chocolate. It was a fantastic day, and both my son and me look back fondly to it!</p>

<h2 id="fatbiking-around-saariselk-village">Fatbiking around Saariselk√§ village</h2>

<p>The next day we rented bikes from <a href="https://www.laplandsafaris.com/en/activities-in-lapland/cycling-and-winter-fat-biking">Lapland Safaris</a> in Saariselk√§ and went on a self-guided trip. As it was snowing and again pretty cold, we decided to ride to the Savottakahvila Caf√© in Laanila, which was a good choice. It was at some point almost a wee Blizzard and it was hard to see far, so we both were happy when we reached the Caf√© and could have a hot chocolate and a Laskiaispulla!</p>

<p>There was an old Prospector‚Äôs cottage close by, and as we both are interested in geology we tried to go there - sadly there‚Äôs no Fatbike trail going to it, and as we didn‚Äôt want to break the Rules we headed back on the same trail to Saariselk√§. By now the weather also started to be a bit more sunny, so it was nice to ride the trails with a fresh cover of snow and in the sunshine ‚òÄÔ∏è‚ùÑ !</p>

<p>On our last day in Saariselk√§ we went Fatbiking with Guide Janne from Lapland Safaris. We got the same bikes as on the previous trip, which was great as they were all dialled in to our heights, and then we took off after Janne!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51047743798/in/dateposted/" title="Guided riding with Janne from Lapland Safaris"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51047743798_053dcb67bf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Guided riding with Janne from Lapland Safaris" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This time we went a bit off-the-beaten-track and road our Fatbikes towards the west on a Trail which I had hiked back in the autumn of 2019, before turning south and then east again towards Laanila. It was yet again a very snowy and cold day, and big snow flakes were coming down from the grey clouds. The trail was well-maintained but the snow kept growing on it, making for good riding.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51048469761/in/dateposted/" title="J√§nis"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51048469761_295652f292_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="J√§nis" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51048474316/in/dateposted/" title="Riding"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51048474316_f8b0714946_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Riding" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the middle of the forest we had a break, drunk some hot, tasty juice which gave us back some warmth, and ate a little snack, while playing with the new, soft snow around us, all while it continued to snow. So much beautiful snow! After this wee break we rode on, arriving at Laanila and then continuing on a familiar trail back to the village.</p>

<p>Fatbiking in Saariselk√§ and Kiilop√§√§ was a fantastic winter activity for us. My son got better at riding with each time we rode our Fatbikes, and he really enjoyed the flowy downhill sections of the trails (he didn‚Äôt care that much about uphills, but then: Few do üòÅ). While he didn‚Äôt fall he did at some points simply on purpose fell into the deep, soft snow which is surrounding the trail, which makes for a soft and safe landing. I was happy about the variety of trails available for us, and that many are easy enough for younger children - though I do hope more demanding and longer trails will get built in the next winter! Overall this was a great alternative to XC or downhill skiing, and allowed us to explore the nature at our own speed - faster than hiking, but slow enough to take in the details of the nature surrounding us. Right now in March and April, with the <em>hankikanto</em> (that time of the year where the top snow layer is carrying people and bikes without that you break through) it is also possible to ride almost everywhere, and especially on the open fells and lakes this makes for fun, good riding. But then you still have these awesome trails, which you really should ride!</p>

<h2 id="where-to-stay-what-to-eat-and-everything-else">Where to stay, what to eat and everything else</h2>

<p>We stayed in an Apartment at the <a href="https://www.laplandhotels.com/FI/lapin-hotellit/saariselka/lapland-hotels-riekonlinna.html">Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna Hotel</a> which has an ideal location: 5 minutes from the Store and even less time to be on a trail for skiing, Fatbiking or hiking. The <a href="https://skisaariselka.com/ski-bus/">Ski Bus</a> stops in front of the building, as are the buses to the south and north.</p>

<p>Our Apartment had all the amenities we could have wished for: A Sauna, comfortable beds, a well-equipped kitchen and a drying closet for drying all our sweaty and wet clothes!</p>

<p>We ate breakfast and dinner at the Hotel, and they served great Vegan food - I really appreciated that! In the afternoons, after we returned from our activities, we usually would sit down at the fire place in the lobby and have a hot chocolate. There are several other Restaurants and Take-Away options in the village, or then we also could have cooked in our apartment.</p>

<p>As usual we travelled by public transportation to Lapland, but if you are not alone then drive your car north - then you are mobile there. Taking the Bus from Rovaniemi to Saariselk√§ is a short and scenic 3 hour ride, and it really gets you in the mood for the outdoors as you ride past lakes and forests and every so often slow down to let the Reindeer get off the road. Taking an (overnight) train to Rovaniemi from Southern Finland is also very convenient, as you wake up well rested and just a short ride away from your next outdoor adventure. This is also a good way to travel if you want to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/outdoors-in-helsinki.html">explore Helsinki</a> before or after a visit in Lapland - or stop for some days in <a href="">Rovaniemi</a> while you are here. Finally, if you come from abroad you also can fly directly to Ivalo, from where you can take a bus or Taxi to Saariselk√§.</p>

<p>In Saariselk√§ you have a great outdoor shop, several Caf√©s and Restaurants and a grocery store. Make sure to read the <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/2020/10/14/travel-safely/">Travel Safely</a> website, use a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/10/reuseable-face-masks.html">Reuseable Face Mask</a> and do all those things which you should do to minimize the risk of getting ill. Other than that - enjoy your holiday in Saariselk√§, Lapland!</p>

<p>Travelling safely during the Covid-19 Pandemic is possible in Finland (with some caveats, more about these <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel/status/1361235118329913344">here</a>) and so my 9-year old son and me travelled to <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/en/">Saariselk√§</a> - long-time readers will remember my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/10/mountainbiking-in-lapland.html">autumn</a> trip there. Saariselk√§ is a tranquil little village with 300 inhabitants and lays at the gates of the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/urho-kekkonen-national-park.html">Urho Kekkonen National Park</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqEBC4yj3Faikt3HHS3jU8l3Fm8pxQvN3">Hammastunturi Wilderness</a>. It has a superb network of Fatbike and XC Skiing trails, a small but very good Ski Resort and plenty of other opportunities of enjoying the outdoors. As well as many great accommodation options, like the wonderful <a href="https://www.laplandhotels.com/EN/hotels-in-lapland/saariselka/lapland-hotels-riekonlinna.html">Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna</a> where we stayed.</p>

<p>We were exceptionally lucky with the weather - it was ‚òÄÔ∏è every day but bitterly cold, some days at low as a felt temperature of -32¬∞C - but even those temps were bearable with the <a href="https://youtu.be/E_ma70A6HkM">right clothes</a> and keeping active!</p>

<p>Behind me lay the solitude of the Hetta-Pallas Trail, in front of me was <a href="https://www.yllas.fi/en/home-page.html">Yll√§s</a> and √Ñk√§slompolo with it‚Äôs many different options of fun in the snow. My new friends dropped me off at the <a href="https://sevenfellshostel.com/en/7-fells-hostel-eng/">7 Fells Hostel</a>, where I moved my stuff into the cozy little cabin which was waiting for me. Outside the sun was setting, but that didn‚Äôt stop me from a short stroll to explore the surroundings a bit more. √Ñk√§slompolo is a compact and cozy village, probably one of the best Finnish winter villages as it is home to both the largest ski resort in Finland as well as a very extensive XC skiing network with over 400 km of Tracks. Add in superb possibilities for skitouring, Fatbiking and winter hiking, and you understand why this little village is so popular with winter lovers.</p>

<h2 id="fatbiking-in-ylls">Fatbiking in Yll√§s</h2>

<p>The next morning brought clear and sunny skies, and it was an easy decision to head back out into the cold again. Going outside makes my life better, it‚Äôs a way to disconnect for hours from Social Media and the internet, and to do something which I like a lot better than sitting in front of a screen: Being in nature, breathing fresh, cold air, feeling the sun and wind on my cheeks. I decided to go for a Fatbike ride, as I could loan a Fatbike from the friendly folks of the 7 Fells Hostel, and they have a really nice Fatbike Trail network in Yll√§s! I rode through the village, past the supermarket, Caf√©s and sports shops, towards the start of the trails.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802510028/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Riding"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802510028_f7dec84430_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Riding" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803257031/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Getting all the Infos"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803257031_d265ccc9be_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Getting all the Infos" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>It was a warm and sunny day, the temperature was +2¬∞C and it was perfect for riding the Fatbike. There were very few people around - this was just at the start of the first Lockdown of 2020 in Finland, and pretty much only locals were around, as well as a very few visitors. I decided to ride to the Kes√§nkij√§rvi Laavu - five years ago I went skitouring on Kes√§nki and I have really good memories of this fjell, and at least seeing it from the lake would make me happy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803257121/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Which way?"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803257121_26715d4e57_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Which way?" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803257446/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Handlebar."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803257446_ee278c4088_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Handlebar." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But that wasn‚Äôt the only thing which made me happy. Riding in this warm weather, in the sun, on empty Fatbike trails, through young birch forests, over swamps and always with the beautiful hills in view, also made me happy. Really happy üòä</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803257751/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="&lt;Mountain"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803257751_47899021f8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="&lt;Mountain" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803373287/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Palls-Yll√§stunturi National Park"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803373287_fe507071fd_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Palls-Yll√§stunturi National Park" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Soon I entered the Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park, where the trails became a bit more narrow, and I was hollering and smiling as I rode through the forest, past the lake shore and towards the wee Laavu at the end of the trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803373447/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Closed Laavu"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803373447_dbe1030b09_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Closed Laavu" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At the Kes√§nki Laavu a thin line of smoke was rising from the fire pit. A large yellow sign was hanging at the top of the Laavu, telling visitors in Finnish, Swedish and English that it was closed because of COVID-19. I had a small sip of water from my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/hydro-flask-standard-mouth-with-standard-flex-cap-isolierflasche/?pid=10239">‚àû bottle</a>, took a few bites from my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/clif-bar-clif-nut-butter-filled-chocolate-hazelnut-butter-energieriegel/?pid=10239">‚àû Nut Butter Clif Bar</a> and explored the surroundings. There‚Äôs a Caf√© across the XC Tracks - which also was closed - where there were two persons, who were, like me, enjoying the sun and silence.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802512608/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Closed Caf√©"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802512608_fe64e153f3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Closed Caf√©" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I was tempted to ride back over the lake, but thought better of it and came the same way - it was a good single track over all, and as it was warm and a yellow sign was warning me that the track over the lake was closed, I opted for the safe alternative. Longingly I watched back towards the hills, wishing I could go ski-touring on them in this grand weather‚Ä¶</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803259061/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Wee Hills"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803259061_c6f1f007ab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Wee Hills" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="skitouring-to-kuertunturi">Skitouring to Kuertunturi</h2>

<p>The next morning was already my last full day in √Ñk√§slompolo, and the weather was grey. Let me be honest: I slept in, had a long breakfast, was reading and at some point in the early afternoon decided I better make the best use of my time here in the snow of Lapland - back home there was no snow, after all. So I packed my gear, put on my <a href="https://tidd.ly/3nn9nIY">‚àû ski boots</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/pXmXznusheI">backpack</a> and skinned up Kuertunturi, which rises up just behind my Cabin at the 7 Fells Hostel. Half-way up I also shot a short video about dressing for ski-touring:</p>

<p>Then my <a href="https://www.dpsskis.com/collections/men/products/wailer_a100_rp">skis</a> and <a href="https://tidd.ly/3pSa5zu">‚àû contour Hybrid skins</a> brought me further up the hill. OK, maybe my legs also had something to contribute‚Ä¶</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803371057/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Skis"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803371057_ee46c318d8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Skis" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802513378/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Top"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802513378_e81d700825_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Top" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At the top of this easy hill - there‚Äôs also a well-marked winter hiking trail going to the summit - I found good weather and amazing views. I had a clear view towards the closed Yll√§s ski resort, Kes√§nki and Lainiotunturi and the over 50 km distant Pallastunturi hills, which I skied across just a few days prior! It was an absolutely stunning scenery which lay around me, and if the sun wouldn‚Äôt have been setting already I probably would have stayed longer to enjoy my last evening in Lapland from the summit of a fjell.</p>

<p>But as the sun was already setting, and my descent through the forest was in the shadow, I decided to head back down. I had some good turns, some ice, some fun moments and some pushing across a frozen swamp before I was back at my cabin, where a warm shower and a tasty <a href="https://tidd.ly/3rUiV1m">‚àû LYO Food meal</a> were waiting for me. As well as some packing, but at least that‚Äôs something which I have down pretty well!</p>

<h2 id="visiting-ylls">Visiting Yll√§s</h2>

<p>Your first stop should be the <a href="https://www.yllas.fi/en/news/corona-info">Yll√§s Corona Info Website</a> and the <a href="https://koronaturvallinenlappi.fi/en/home/">Coronavirus situation in Lapland</a> website, which inform you both about the hygiene concept in Yll√§s and the ski resort as well as the current COVID-19 situation in all of Lapland. Personally I would avoid the ‚Äúbusy‚Äù weeks and go when very few people are in Lapland, to minimize the risk of getting exposed and/ or putting a strain on the health care system. You yourself obviously should either have a negative PCR Test that is not older than three days or already received the vaccine. If that is all in order: Plan your trip!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802510513/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="My Cabin at the 7 Fells Hostel"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802510513_47c2045f74_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="My Cabin at the 7 Fells Hostel" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I stayed at the very stylish &amp; cozy <a href="https://sevenfellshostel.com/en/7-fells-hostel-eng/">7 Fells Hostel</a> which I can highly recommend, and also the <a href="https://yllaslodge.com/en/">Lodge 67ÀöN</a> gets good reviews. There are more <a href="https://www.yllas.fi/en/accommodation.html">accommodation options in Yll√§s</a>, too, from Hotels to cabins in the woods. Yll√§s has a host of <a href="https://www.yllas.fi/en/services.html">services</a>, from eating out over rental gear to shopping for groceries, so you can find everything in the village in case you forgot something or want to try XC skiing or Fatbiking!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803375862/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Busstop"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803375862_689c24eba9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Busstop" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>To the North and back South I travelled with <a href="https://www.onnibus.com/home">OnniBus</a>, <a href="https://www.matkahuolto.fi/en">local busses</a> and the <a href="https://www.vr.fi/en">train</a>, and while it is a long trip it is affordable, comfortable and takes less time than driving by car. If you have to get around in the village, there‚Äôs a ski bus and also taxis, so there really is no need for an own car.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802514333/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Road Home"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802514333_3f06d67995_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Road Home" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong> I think I spent again too few days in Yll√§s. I still haven‚Äôt skied in its ski resort, and would love to go on more skitouring trips on the surrounding hills. Also the amazing XC Tracks are really inviting, so a longer trip to this hidden pearl is in order! What about you - have you been to √Ñk√§slompolo and Yll√§s?

<p>In January 2002 I moved to Finland. Before I moved to this country in the North-East of Europe, I had visited the country and <a href="https://www.myhelsinki.fi/en/">capital Helsinki</a> a handful of times, and it always left me with a good feeling. The feeling that I could be who I want to be. Society didn‚Äôt care that I had long hairs, and I got the exact same treatment at the store like the young mother in her Marimekko dress and the bank clerk in a suit. I loved this feeling of being able to be me, like I wanted to be.</p>

<p>During my visits to Helsinki, and also living here for a bit while I was working at a sustainability startup and then in 2018 spending a wonderful summer in the capital with my kids while my wife worked at a Service Design Agency, this feeling of freedom to be and do grew. It is something I hugely appreciate: The possibility to life in the centre of the capital where I can put my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning shoes</a> on and go for a run in the city‚Äôs nature. Taking my small kids on a free boat trip to Suomenlinna and eat an ice cream (<em>if your child sits in a pram, you can use public transportation for free in Helsinki!</em>). Riding my bike on the extensive bike roads through the city. Walking safely to the harbour to take long exposure photos of well-known buildings in the middle of the night. All this is possible in Helsinki, without stress and in safety.</p>

<p>As you might know from my previous articles, in Helsinki you are never far away from nature, too. In my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/outdoors-in-helsinki.html">Outdoor Guide to Helsinki</a> I have shown how easy it is to enjoy the outdoors in and around the city, and a small Microadventure in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/microadventure-sipoonkorpi-national-park.html">Sipoonkorpi National Park</a> is just as easy as it is simply a short bus ride away. Going so easily and quickly to nature is a freedom which I really appreciate about Helsinki - if the hustle and bustle of the city gets too much it is not difficult to escape for a wee bit, so that you can <a href="https://www.myhelsinki.fi/en/work-and-study/helsinki-freedom/freedom-to-breathe">breathe in nature</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50729899462/in/dateposted/" title="Kota"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50729899462_342e41244f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Kota" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/43900435821/" title="A beautiful Kota"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1819/43900435821_88217d2d49_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="A beautiful Kota" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But you don‚Äôt have to take a bus to Sipoo or Nuuksio to get into nature, right in the city there‚Äôs plenty of parks, public beaches and small islands which are inviting for a walk, swim or picknick. Seakayaking or paddling is a fantastic way to explore the capital, and being on the water, paddling to a small island and going for a swim are for me the definition of being free.</p>

<p>It is not just nature, which is easily accessible in Helsinki. I loved visiting <a href="https://youtu.be/vFQ-iLa3m88">RopeCon</a> and meeting fellow geeks and nerds from all over Finland, and the Helsinki Pride Parade is a beautiful happening to attend and enjoy, <a href="https://www.myhelsinki.fi/en/work-and-study/helsinki-freedom/freedom-to-love">whatever your sexual orientation</a>. It‚Äôs one of the beauties of Helsinki and Finland, that you are free to be who you want to be: Gay, queer, non-binary, a role-playing geek or a hockey fan. Maybe that is why Finland was ranked as the <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2020/#read">happiest country in the World</a> in 2018 and 2019, and Helsinki is the happiest city in the world?!</p>

<p>It could be that that is the reason. And the city does a lot of things very well: Good public transportation, amazing Museums, libraries and public beaches and Caf√©s and Restaurants for any taste, from local over vegan to delicious Asian food, you can find anything to <a href="https://kathrindeter.com/category/restaurants/">suit your taste</a> in Helsinki when you get hungry. As the leading Nation in coffee consumption on the planet you can get plenty of amazing cups of coffee at the many lovely Caf√©s, too ‚òïÔ∏è</p>

<p>There are many more good reasons why Helsinki is a great place to life. One more I can think of is that it‚Äôs very simple to start your own business in Finland, and Helsinki has a superb Start-up scene where you can connect with like-minded people and bounce off your ideas. Equally there are also many good companies to work for in different industries. Heck, you might even be able to keep your current job and simply move to Helsinki to live the good life in Finland! So in case you now are pondering coming to live (and hike!) in Finland, have a look at these five <a href="https://www.myhelsinki.fi/en/work-and-study/helsinki-freedom">interesting short movies</a> which highlight some of the aspects I mentioned in this article.</p>

<p>As for me, I am looking forward to my next visit to Helsinki, to meet friends, stroll along the coast, drink a tasty coffee and hear the waves lap against the shore! Maybe I will meet you there?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Autumn is a busy time for us, as a lot of garden work needs to be done, we celebrate two birthdays, days get shorter and <em>Oh, there‚Äôs all the usual work, too!</em>. So a weekend get-away might seem like not the best idea, but indeed our small vacation in Rokua recharged our batteries and we had a lot of fun together as a family.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50396808772/in/album-72157716172733938/" title="Autumn colours in Rokua GeoPark 3"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50396808772_76300e2ed6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Autumn colours in Rokua GeoPark 3" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Days get shorter, mushrooms and berries are everywhere in the forests, and of course the trees start to be their prettiest üçÅüçÇ Autumn is my favourite time of the year, and the possibility to share this special season with my family at the <a href="https://www.rokua.com">Rokua Health &amp; Spa Hotel</a> was very welcome, despite the busy times we usually have between the end of summer and the Holidays. So early on a Friday morning we packed our one <a href="https://tidd.ly/3o1B1wu">‚àû Arc‚Äôteryx V110 Rolling Duffel</a> into a loaned car and started the drive North to Rokua. It is situated a wee bit from Oulu, and it was a beautiful, scenic drive along colourful trees to our destination.</p>

<p>We arrived early in the afternoon at the Hotel, checked in and then went to see both our room and the Kids Playroom. The Playroom was definitely a ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è facility, not only did they have toys for kids of all ages (and for both boys and girls equally!), but they also had a small Movie Theatre, a game room with XBoxes &amp; PlayStations, lots of board games and what our kids enjoyed the most, the little ‚Äúgym‚Äù. Over the course of the weekend our two kids never got tired to go play here, and it definitely did set the bar really high for future hotel visits.</p>

<p>Since I learned to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/active-holidays-in-are-sweden.html">Downhill MTB in √Öre</a> a few years ago I really love to ride bikes on Single Trails in the forest and hills. Mountain biking in Rokua is really enjoyable, as there‚Äôs a dedicated Team of locals who establish and maintain a superb trail network, and also in the <a href="https://www.rokuageopark.fi/en/experience">Rokua GeoPark</a> and the <a href="https://www.nationalparks.fi/rokuanp">Rokua National Park</a> you are allowed to drive on marked MTB Trails.</p>

<p>Hannu rode a short 15 km loop with me, showing me a lot of beautiful, scenic spots along the way. From a Kota and a Laavu, to silent lakes which are surrounded by yellow birches, and lovely little trails through the GeoPark, I had a big smile on my face riding with Hannu, and really thankful that he went out with me. During the weekend he went on to coach a course at the Hotel about Mountain biking, and I am certain the participants came away with an equally big passion for riding on forest trails as him.</p>

<p>If you want to see more MTBing in Rokua, you should go watch my <a href="https://youtu.be/9UaMahrgToc">Video from Rokua</a> where there‚Äôs quite a bit of footage of riding - this was the first test of my new <a href="https://amzn.to/35fK8B2">‚àû GoPro HERO 9</a> and I have to say that the image stabilization is pretty amazing!</p>

<p>On Saturday it was my turn to take care of the kids during the morning and afternoon, as M joined a Mushroom course. Having two people in the family who can identify mushrooms is better than one person, and M enjoyed the company and instructions at the course. Every participant got a small mushroom knife and a basket, and then they set off into the forest around the Hotel to collect. The Guide was around to help with identifying, but at the end the group went to the Kota next to the Hotel, where they went through all the mushrooms everyone had collected, and the Instructor explained what are the really delicious mushrooms, tasty mushrooms, edible mushrooms, and mushrooms you shouldn‚Äôt pick or eat üçÑ After that the instructor prepared a tasty dish from the really delicious mushrooms the whole group had collected!</p>

<p>While M was at the course the kids and me packed our <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/09/huckepacks-phoenix-lite-review.html">backpacks</a> and went for a short hike. I am very happy that our two kids like to go hiking - and they especially like it if there‚Äôs a üî• and marshmallows involved! We hiked a small loop, and used what would be the XC skiing loipe in winter for the way to the Jaakonj√§rvi Laavu. It‚Äôs an easy trail with some good views, but on the way back we decided to hike on and next to the abandoned rail track. This was a lot more fun and we saw more - more reindeer moss, more mushrooms, more berries and even a lovely orange-coloured swamp, as well as plenty of nice, little side trails.</p>

<p>At the Laavu I made a fire, we drunk hot juice and while the kids explored the surroundings I prepared them their sticks for grilling their marshmallows. It‚Äôs funny how such a small extra - molten sugar, basically! - can make from a simple hike a very memorable little trip.</p>

<p>The afternoon all four of us met up again, and we went together to the Spa and swimming pools. Our kids love to play in the water, and with a Sauna next door it is easy to go warm up in between swimming and so stay longer in the water!</p>

<p>Early on Sunday morning, after we had breakfast together, I sneaked out for another little MTB trip. This time I decided I wanted to ride to the southern-most Kota which could be reached on the cycling trails, at Rokuanj√§rvi. It was easy to follow the yellow dots of the MTB Trail from the Hotel till the Kota, where I met two young women which had camped out here. It‚Äôs a beautiful, scenic spot and I was happy they had a wee fire going and welcomed me inside, so I could drink a bit of water.</p>

<p>We chatted about cycling and hiking at Rokua National park and GeoPark, and then I said Farewell and cycled back to the Hotel - it was time to check-out and head home, after all. I filmed a lot with my <a href="https://amzn.to/35fK8B2">‚àû new GoPro HERO 9</a>, and looking at the footage I am really amazed about this small camera, and can‚Äôt wait to take it skiing and packrafting! But that will be another story =)</p>

<p>While the kids enjoyed the last moments at the Playroom I packed up and got everything into the car, happy that we have an <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/06/ultralight-family-travel-with-eagle-creek.html">organized and lightweight packing approach</a> when we travel. That way packing is a breeze and soon we were on the way back south.</p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that we had a relaxing and adventurous family weekend at the <a href="https://www.rokua.com">Rokua Health &amp; Spa Hotel</a> and are ready for the remaining busy autumn! With its location right in the middle of the National Park and GeoPark - the only of its kind in Finland, by the way! - we could walk out of the Rokua Health &amp; Spa Hotel and be right in the middle of nature. Hiking, mushroom picking, Mountain biking, Trailrunning: It‚Äôs right in front of the door. As is a Playground, an Adventure Trail for kids, a lake in which you can go rowing, swimming and fishing, and in case the weather is not ideal for outdoor adventures: Stay indoors! With the modern Spa and swimming pool facilities, as well as the large gym, and not to forget the Kids Playroom you don‚Äôt have a reason to sit on your room when it rains outside. So if you too need a relaxing weekend away to recharge your body &amp; mind - head to Rokua!</p>
