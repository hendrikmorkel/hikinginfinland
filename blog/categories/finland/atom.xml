<p>I’m a cyclist, and on my backpacking and work trips riding my bike is one of the few things I miss. I like the speed, the new perspective on things, the ability to see more in a shorter amount of time. It’s great, fun, too! So when I saw that one of my <a href="https://polarlifeoutdoor.com">Polarlife Outdoors</a> activities would be to go ride Mountainbike in the fjells, I was really happy and excited. <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/active-holidays-in-are-sweden.html">Last year in Åre</a> I learned to ride downhill mountainbiking and I have looked forward to another opportunity to ride a bike in the hills of Lapland.</p>

<p>The forecast for the day was grey and rainy, but tht did not dampen my spirit. I met up with Reima &amp; Tiina from <a href="https://saariselkatraining.com">Saariselkä Training</a> and Anni at the bike shed, where we got our bikes, and then we were altogether off to the hills!</p>

<p>Now this was not a downhill ride. We powered up the fjell with our own power (no eBike or gondola!) and rode from wide, easy paths over swampy duckboard sections to a very short stoney trail to the summit on many different kinds of terrain, which is excellent for beginners like me. That way the trail got a little more demanding the higher we got, and once at the summit it was wide views, happy high-fives, and getting excited about the downhill ride.</p>

<p>As these things tend to go, by the time we rolled towards the single trail the weather decided it was time for a bit more moisture, and so a light drizzle started to accompany us on our way down. This did not curb our enthusiasm for the singletrail, though! Reima and Tiina were shredding fast down their home trails, and I was hollering with joy in the beautiful nature!</p>

<p>After a way too short section of easy downhill singletrail Tiina &amp; Reima guided us on gorgeous paths through the autumnal forest. Pine needles from many years made these trails soft and enjoyable, with little curves, small ups &amp; downs, and around us the forest with all the beautiful colours of red, orange, yellow and green.</p>

<p>Sadly also this delightful forest ride was over too quickly, as we arrived at a cozy Kota, where Reima brewed us a fine coffee and and we ate some home-made cake. This is such a nice touch, eating real, home-made food outdoors, and drinking good coffee, and in hindsight it seemed to be a unifying thing between all the Polarlife Outdoors activities I did that week: Tasty food, prepared at home, enjoyed with kind people, in nature.</p>

<p>We chatted about cycling, the outdoors and life in the North during our coffee break, and then saddled our bikes for a final time as we had a short ride back to the village in front of us. We continued our chats on the bike, and it made me want to go for another mountainbike trip here with these two in the beautiful nature of Lapland. Reima and Tiina were excellent guides, very calm, friendly and down-to-earth - I really enjoyed spending time with them, riding in and around the woods &amp; hills of the Urho Kekkonen National Park, and I hope to ride again with them the next time I visit Saariselkä 😊</p>

<p><em>Read about the other Polarlife Outdoors activities I did, like <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/09/wild-foods-of-lapland.html">preparing Wild Foods in the forest</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/09/hiking-to-akupaa-summit.html">hiking to the Akupää summit</a>!</em></p>

<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities!</h2>

<p>I stayed in Saariselkä, which is probably <em>THE</em> place to be when you want to explore the North-Eastern corner of Finnish Lapland. Besides a dozen or more options for accommodation options - I stayed at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fi/lapland-riekonlinna.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna‎</a> - the village lays right at the border of the Urho Kekkonen National Park and is just a short 2 hour stroll away from the Hammastunturi Wilderness Area. This means you don’t need a car to go outdoors in Saariselkä, as you can walk in a few minutes from your Hotel or log cabin to the start of a trail. Here’s the <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=900040403&amp;aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&amp;room1=A">full list of Hotels and Cabins in Saariselkä</a>, and feel free to use that Affiliate Link when you’re making a reservation!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743375433/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna Room"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743375433_e869ca2dad_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna Room" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Getting to Saariselkä happens in one of three ways: You drive your car north for a veeeeeeery long time but are mobile there. Useful if you want to drive to different places, but hopefully you’re not alone in that car! The second and best option is to take the train and Bus. Taking the Bus from Rovaniemi to Saariselkä is a short and scenic 3 hour ride, and it really gets you in the mood for the outdoors as you ride past lakes and forests and every so often slow down to let the Reindeer get off the road. Taking an (overnight) train to Rovaniemi from Southern Finland is also very convenient, as you wake up well rested and just a short ride away from your next outdoor adventure. This is also a good way to travel if you want to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/outdoors-in-helsinki.html">explore Helsinki</a> before or after a visit in Lapland. Finally, if you come from abroad you also can fly directly to Ivalo, from where you can take a bus or Taxi to Saariselkä.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/0i3st0" title="Oulu - Tromso"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48780910708_729d052bdf_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="Oulu - Tromso" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Saariselkä has for a village its size a variety of different options for eating out, from Anne’s Garden which serves delicious Burgers (great for backpackers who just returned to civilization!) to fine dining at Santa’s Hotel Tunturi and Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna‎ or the tasty Buffet at the Holiday Club. Cafe Porotupa at the market square makes really good coffee (On a side note, I’m always baffled how much bad coffee you get served in a variety of places in Finland, the World Champion in coffee consumption) and also fresh pancakes and cakes. If you rather cook yourself, then the supermarket in the village has everything you need, or if you need to stock-up on dehydrated meals for another backpacking trip then visit the <a href="https://www.partioaitta.fi/myymalat/saariselka/">Partioaitta Saariselkä</a>, probably the most-northern Outdoor Store in Finland!</p>

<p>During my visit at Saariselkä I participated in many different <a href="https://polarlifeoutdoor.com">Polarlife Outdoors</a> activities, include going to the Sauna and Spa at the Holiday Club, hiking on one of the dozen of trails around the village, visiting the AMAZING Aurora Open Wilderness Hut when you want to see Northern Lights, participate in a wild herbs Workshop, visit a Sauna and going to swim in a stream, or rent a Mountainbike and explore one of the many single track trails and holler with joy when you ride down the fjell! During the next weeks you’ll be able to read more about my adventures in the far north and some of these activities, so consider <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/">becoming a Fan on Facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a> to not miss the next instalments!</p>

<p>We rolled into the <a href="https://arcticskylapland.com">Arctic Sky</a> parking lot and I immediately felt like this is a good place. Beautiful wooden buildings, a herb garden on the side, and a traditional <em>Kota</em> being built to gather in in the evenings. Minna welcomed us in, and it almost felt like I entered my own home. Minna and her partner Aarno have built this small resort - ten people can stay here – from 400 year old lumber which they picked up in southern Finland and transported here to the far North, and then continued to decorate their house and the Guesthouse in a wonderful cozy style, from the hand-made woolen socks which you can slip into at the door to the beautiful animal prints which give each of the five guest rooms their names. Yes, you can stay at Arctic Sky, but I was here for an introduction to nordic Herbs and then some searching and cooking some wild food, as part of my <a href="https://polarlifeoutdoor.com">Polarlife Outdoors</a> experience.</p>

<p>So after a look through the cozy house we shouldered our packs, grabbed each a woven basket and headed into the woods to find some Mushrooms, pick berries, and hike to a Laavu to prepare our findings into a tasty meal.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743926902/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Bilberries"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743926902_e6243172ec_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Bilberries" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We hiked on the Ruijanpolku, a trail I didn’t exist, and which is a rather old and long trail. I might need to return to go backpacking on it some day in the future, but right now I was more occupied with finding tasty mushrooms and bilberries for our desert. It’s funny how I can completely can zoom-in on searching mushrooms, and the hunter &amp; gatherer in me is also one which isn’t happy with having a full basket of mushrooms - I always want to find more 😃</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743926192/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Ruijanpolku"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743926192_314866f63c_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Ruijanpolku" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After a very successful search for mushrooms, and learning to identify a few new ones (that is one of the benefits of going mushroom picking with someone!) we arrived at a very wonderful Laavu next to a lovely stream. We weren’t alone, though - many dayhikers enjoyed this beautiful spot, eating snacks, drinking tea, and grilling sausages. Also, I made a new friend.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743934682/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Siberian Jay"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743934682_c54826a8dd_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Siberian Jay" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>While I was busy snapping the next Konsta Punkka image Minna was busy preparing our food.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743752121/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Preparing shrooms"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743752121_1ba5987ca0_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Preparing shrooms" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The smell of mushrooms which sizzle over the fire in a pan is something so mouth-watering, just the thought of them makes me want to grab my coat and head out into the forest to go find some mushrooms!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743417398/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Tasty starter!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743417398_fae60f2fe5_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Tasty starter!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But while the mushrooms were frying in the pan we ate our starter, which we prepared ourselves from the things Minna brought along. We garnished it with some of the herbs we picked in her garden, and yes, it was as tasty as it looks!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743418023/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Even more tasty Main!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743418023_2549c115da_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Even more tasty Main!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then it was time for the main course, our fried mushrooms were served with a vegan nettle pancake and some again we could use the different herbs we picked earlier to garnish it. These mushroom pancakes were so tasty that I ate three of them - just so much to leave some space for the dessert!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743419953/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Dessert Volume II"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743419953_65b9833a8c_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Dessert Volume II" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A lingonberry mousse in a dark chocolate coat, together with a bilberry sauce which we prepared from the berries we picked along the way. Oh my, this indeed was a sweet finish to an outstanding meal! If you now feel hungry - then no worries, Minna is happy to take you out on a hike like this! When you stay with Minna and Aarno at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fi/arctic-sky-lapland.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Arctic Sky Resort</a> you can pick and choose from a <a href="https://arcticskylapland.com/your-own-arctic-wellness-week">great variety of activities</a>, including the one you just read about! I definitely would recommend going with a few friends or the family, that way you can enjoy sitting in the cozy kitchen in the evenings, play some UNO or another board game, and chat while it slowly gets dark outside!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743758731/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Wood"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743758731_5c2a1e9a1b_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Wood" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After all that tasty food and the hike back I got a ride to the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fi/muotka-igloos.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Wilderness Hotel Muotka</a>, but not to lay down and rest - nope. I did the most typical thing you can do in Finland: Going to Sauna.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48826135788/in/dateposted/" title="Sauna Timelapse"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48826135788_6662724415_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Sauna Timelapse" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now while I didn’t much enjoy my river crossings in the Hammastunturi Wilderness, at Muotka I even went to swim in the stream several times! I reckon if a warm Sauna and dry clothes are waiting for you, going into a cold stream is less of an issue 😃 Obviously going to chill by a fireplace in the sun afterwards makes a dip in the cold stream even less of a problem.</p>

<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities!</h2>

<p>I stayed in Saariselkä, which is probably <em>THE</em> place to be when you want to explore the North-Eastern corner of Finnish Lapland - or you stay at <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fi/arctic-sky-lapland.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Arctic Sky</a> if you want to be enjoy a more silent stay. Besides a dozen or more options for accommodation options - I stayed at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fi/lapland-riekonlinna.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna‎</a> - the village lays right at the border of the Urho Kekkonen National Park and is just a short 2 hour stroll away from the Hammastunturi Wilderness Area. This means you don’t need a car to go outdoors in Saariselkä, as you can walk in a few minutes from your Hotel or log cabin to the start of a trail. Here’s the <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=900040403&amp;aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&amp;room1=A">full list of Hotels and Cabins in Saariselkä</a>, and feel free to use that Affiliate Link when you’re making a reservation!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743375433/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna Room"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743375433_e869ca2dad_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna Room" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Getting to Saariselkä happens in one of three ways: You drive your car north for a veeeeeeery long time but are mobile there. Useful if you want to drive to different places, but hopefully you’re not alone in that car! The second and best option is to take the train and Bus. Taking the Bus from Rovaniemi to Saariselkä is a short and scenic 3 hour ride, and it really gets you in the mood for the outdoors as you ride past lakes and forests and every so often slow down to let the Reindeer get off the road. Taking an (overnight) train to Rovaniemi from Southern Finland is also very convenient, as you wake up well rested and just a short ride away from your next outdoor adventure. This is also a good way to travel if you want to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/outdoors-in-helsinki.html">explore Helsinki</a> before or after a visit in Lapland. Finally, if you come from abroad you also can fly directly to Ivalo, from where you can take a bus or Taxi to Saariselkä.</p>

<p>Saariselkä has for a village its size a variety of different options for eating out, from Anne’s Garden which serves delicious Burgers (great for backpackers who just returned to civilization!) to fine dining at Santa’s Hotel Tunturi and Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna‎ or the tasty Buffet at the Holiday Club. Cafe Porotupa at the market square makes really good coffee (On a side note, I’m always baffled how much bad coffee you get served in a variety of places in Finland, the World Champion in coffee consumption) and also fresh pancakes and cakes. If you rather cook yourself, then the supermarket in the village has everything you need, or if you need to stock-up on dehydrated meals for another backpacking trip then visit the <a href="https://www.partioaitta.fi/myymalat/saariselka/">Partioaitta Saariselkä</a>, probably the most-northern Outdoor Store in Finland!</p>

<p>During my visit at Saariselkä I participated in many different <a href="https://polarlifeoutdoor.com">Polarlife Outdoors</a> activities, include going to the Sauna and Spa at the Holiday Club, hiking on one of the dozen of trails around the village, visiting the AMAZING Aurora Open Wilderness Hut when you want to see Northern Lights, participate in a wild herbs Workshop, visit a Sauna and going to swim in a stream, or rent a Mountainbike and explore one of the many single track trails and holler with joy when you ride down the fjell!

<p>During my visit at Saariselkä I participated in several <a href="https://polarlifeoutdoor.com">Polarlife Outdoors</a> activities, and hiking with Henna was one of the highlights. Not only do I know how to hike, after five days in the Wilderness of Hammastunturi it was nice to have a chat with another person again! Henna from <a href="https://www.laplandlife.net/">Laplandlife</a> picked me up at my Hotel in Saariselkä and we hit it off right from the bat. She’s an upbeat, happy young women who after studying across Finland decided to return home to Lapland and combine all her passions and create her own business. That business is Laplandlife, and with it Henna takes people who visit the Ivalo-Saariselkä Region hiking, camping and berry picking in the summer, and snowshoeing, arctic swimming and ice fishing in the winter. As a professional massage therapist she also can help you relax after a day outdoors, and her <a href="https://www.laplandlife.net/wilderness-cabins/">Wilderness Cabins</a> are so far off-the-beaten track that you can be sure to not encounter anyone else during your stay there!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48780880326/in/dateposted/" title="Along the lake"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48780880326_99d464e289_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Along the lake" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Henna and I, however, were off to hike to the summit of Akupää. <em>“It’s in my backyard”</em> she told me as we drove to Ivalo, and silently I was wondering what that meant. What it meant became clear when we arrived: We passed a gate while she explained that all this land here, hundreds of hectares, belong to her dad. We drove to the end of a gravel road next to a most picturesque lake, the start of our hike. <em>“At the other side of the lake, well-hidden between the trees and far apart, are the two cabins”</em> Henna hold me, and I was already wondering how amazing it must be to spend a holiday here. No noise except the wind in the trees and the calls of birds could be heard, it’s exactly the kind of sounds I love and which you don’t get in the city.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743901177/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Autumn light"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743901177_787b3c0e11_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Autumn light" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Along the lake we hiked on game trails and small forest roads, all the time chatting about outdoor life in Lapland. After half an hour Henna offered me some home-made berry juice which was delicious, and then we set off slowly to climb towards the summit of Akupää. Completely off-trail we hiked through the most beautiful autumn birch and pine forests, often stopping to pick some bilberries and lingonberries which were growing in abundance on the floor of the forest.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743903127/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Henna on the way up"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743903127_218c9c73c2_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Henna on the way up" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Here and there the forest opened up where trees have fallen, and we revelled in the beauty of it all under the sunshine on this autumn day. The conversation was flowing, we laughed together while steadily climbing higher and higher on this fjell. And then, through the low-grown birch trees, the summit came into view. My natural reaction when seeing the summit is to turn around and see what kind of view is to be seen, and here, just below the summit of Akupää, the view was beautiful. Low, pine-covered hills with small lakes who were glistening from the sunlight, we could see far into the distance.</p>

<p>But, this wasn’t the summit yet. It was a few minutes further, and what awaited me there really was gorgeous.</p>

<p>We could see till Russia from the summit, observed how two Raven and an Eagle were having an air show, and in every direction you could see forest-covered hill after forest-covered hill, creating an absolutely stunning panorama of silhouettes. After spending over half an hour at the summit Henna was ready to continue, and while I could have stood there and take in the view till past sunset, I shouldered my backpack and followed her. We passed beautiful little ponds which were so still and created dazzling mirror images, and soon we were back in the embrace of the forest with its golden leafs.</p>

<p>After a while we made a proper break, with a fire, sitting down, eating a tasty meal and drinking fresh coffee. I lay down on the soft forest floor, on my bed of moss and shrubbery, while lounging in the sun and drinking another cup of coffee. <em>“This is the good life”</em> I proclaimed, and Henna agreed. We sat there in the forest, silently, happy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743896817/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Fall"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743896817_cbda0bb41b_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Fall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A small detour on the way back was made, to a gorge, and Henna showed me where she takes guests to go camping in Tentsile tree-tents - a beautiful spot high above the gorge, which must have great views at night to the stars. We didn’t wait for the stars to come out, though - we continued on game trails back to the lake.</p>

<p>At the lake I was able to get very close to the Dragonfly you see above. Dragonflies are without a doubt my favourite insects, I love their grace and how beautiful they are. If I ever would get a tattoo, then the tattoo of a dragonfly would be high up on the list. Back at the car I thanked Henna for the beautiful hike in her backyard, and thought to myself that if more people would have a backyard like her, and care as deeply for it, the world would be a better place. On the drive back to Saariselkä I spotted a juvenile Golden Eagle which made me smile, as these birds are not so often seen that dar in the north. I also wished for a longer lens to capture it even more up-close (<a href="https://paypal.me/hendrikmorkel">You can send me a tip via PayPal</a> if you want that I can take better photos of wildlife in the future!), but I think the photo underneath is pretty good, too!</p>

<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities!</h2>

<p>I stayed in Saariselkä, which is probably <em>THE</em> place to be when you want to explore the North-Eastern corner of Finnish Lapland. Besides a dozen or more options for accommodation options - I stayed at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fi/lapland-riekonlinna.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna‎</a> - the village lays right at the border of the Urho Kekkonen National Park and is just a short 2 hour stroll away from the Hammastunturi Wilderness Area. This means you don’t need a car to go outdoors in Saariselkä, as you can walk in a few minutes from your Hotel or log cabin to the start of a trail. Here’s the <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=900040403&amp;aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&amp;room1=A">full list of Hotels and Cabins in Saariselkä</a>, and feel free to use that Affiliate Link when you’re making a reservation!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743375433/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna Room"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743375433_e869ca2dad_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna Room" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Getting to Saariselkä happens in one of three ways: You drive your car north for a veeeeeeery long time but are mobile there. Useful if you want to drive to different places, but hopefully you’re not alone in that car! The second and best option is to take the train and Bus. Taking the Bus from Rovaniemi to Saariselkä is a short and scenic 3 hour ride, and it really gets you in the mood for the outdoors as you ride past lakes and forests and every so often slow down to let the Reindeer get off the road. Taking an (overnight) train to Rovaniemi from Southern Finland is also very convenient, as you wake up well rested and just a short ride away from your next outdoor adventure. This is also a good way to travel if you want to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/outdoors-in-helsinki.html">explore Helsinki</a> before or after a visit in Lapland. Finally, if you come from abroad you also can fly directly to Ivalo, from where you can take a bus or Taxi to Saariselkä.</p>

<p>Saariselkä has for a village its size a variety of different options for eating out, from Anne’s Garden which serves delicious Burgers (great for backpackers who just returned to civilization!) to fine dining at Santa’s Hotel Tunturi and Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna‎ or the tasty Buffet at the Holiday Club. Cafe Porotupa at the market square makes really good coffee (On a side note, I’m always baffled how much bad coffee you get served in a variety of places in Finland, the World Champion in coffee consumption) and also fresh pancakes and cakes. If you rather cook yourself, then the supermarket in the village has everything you need, or if you need to stock-up on dehydrated meals for another backpacking trip then visit the <a href="https://www.partioaitta.fi/myymalat/saariselka/">Partioaitta Saariselkä</a>, probably the most-northern Outdoor Store in Finland!</p>

<p>During my visit at Saariselkä I participated in many different <a href="https://polarlifeoutdoor.com">Polarlife Outdoors</a> activities, include going to the Sauna and Spa at the Holiday Club, hiking on one of the dozen of trails around the village, visiting the AMAZING Aurora Open Wilderness Hut when you want to see Northern Lights, participate in a wild herbs Workshop, visit a Sauna and going to swim in a stream, or rent a Mountainbike and explore one of the many single track trails and holler with joy when you ride down the fjell!

<p>I started my trip in Lapland with five days of backpacking in the Hammastunturi Wilderness Area.</p>

<p>Golddiggers, fast-flowing rivers for fishing and packrafting, cozy open huts, almost no people, beautiful fjells with great views, Hammastunturi has it all.</p>

<p>After five days in the wilderness I returned to Saariselkä, had a hot shower and Sauna, and enjoyed several <a href="https://polarlifeoutdoor.com">Polarlife Outdoor</a> experiences. First I went hiking with Henna from Lapland Life in her backyard. A backyard with some stupendously good views, too.</p>

<p>The next day Minna from Arctic Sky Lapland went mushroom and berry picking with me, and then she prepared over the fire the most tasty vegan meal out of it. My mouth is watering just thinking about it now!</p>

<p>Can you smell that? It’s that fresh yet slightly mouldy smell which hangs in the air when you now walk through the forest, which tells us it is the end of summer. Of course also the first yellow leaves 🍂 on the ground are a tell-tale sign of the change of the season, and I always start to smile when I smell that odour and see them 🍂. But also the 🍄 which start to come now out (thanks to a lot of rain 💦 these past few weeks) tell us: Time to start planning your autumn hikes! Well, here’s some videos and photos to inspire you to experience this beautiful time outdoors!</p>

<p>In 2018 my best friend Martin and me paid a visit to the Pyrenees. They are everything anyone who has ever hiked there tells you they are, so if you fancy a visit to Spain, France and Andorra and exploring their mountains you should jump on a train to Southern Europe for your autumn trip!</p>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/autumn-backpacking-in-the-dolomites.html">Backpacking in the Dolomites</a> is the experience of a life-time. Hiking beneath the Tre Cime is magical and awe-inspiring, and best of all: In autumn you won’t meet many people at all!</p>

<p>As you can see, from Northern to Southern Europe, autumn is everywhere the best backpacking season. Even better, you could start next week with your first autumn backpacking trip in Lapland, and then continually travel further south as this magical season travels across the continent, colouring the leaves, giving the mountains their first dusting of snow, and making us grin into the morning sun with our hot cup of coffee in our hands!</p>
