    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Hetta-Pallas cross country skiing trail has been for a very long time on my wish list, and amid the current chaos I was able to escape to the farthest North of Finland and ski this breathtakingly beautiful trail. <em>Here are my first impressions.</em></p>

<p>I started this trip in Hetta, which took me around 16 hours to travel to. A relaxing and cozy night at the Hetan Majatalo was spent in this calm village, and the next morning my Pulka and me started on the trail south towards Pallas, under beautiful sunshine.</p>

<p>The 2nd day was one of the most exhausting days outdoors in memory. I was absolutely destroyed after I arrived at Pahakuru Hut. But nature’s lightshow made up for it rather well.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49715787928/in/dateposted-public/" title="Hannunkuru Sauna"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49715787928_ac3c16c7a9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hannunkuru Sauna" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That the outside world also had an effect on this remote location was evident also in the middle of the trail.</p>

<p>In the end it was a beautiful trip, and I can’t wait to write it down and share it with you. It was exhausting, with a relentless wind which robbed me of much joy on some days, and the lingering worry of “<em>Do I get back home?</em>” as buses and trains were cancelled. In the end I had a lot of luck and thanks to a very kind couple got a ride from the middle of nowhere to Ylläs, where I spent another few days skiing and Fatbiking before I returned home to Vaasa.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A month ago my son and me went on a father-son winter trip: XC skiing, Ice-fishing and of course downhill skiing was our program for a week, in which we had a lot of fun and got to know each other better.</p>

<p>Travelling with kids, it can be a hassle. We found the best way to do it for us is to do it in sections with longer breaks in the middle, plenty of comics to read and some candy &amp; snacks. With that strategy the 9-ish hour trip from Vaasa to Ruka went by without problems, and my 8-year old son and me arrived nice and punctual with the Skibus in the village of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/04/spring-skiing-in-ruka.html">Ruka</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49546855563/in/dateposted-public/" title="On the road"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49546855563_14c0513681_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="On the road" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>From the bus stop it was a one minute walk to our accommodation, the Ski-Inn right in the middle of Ruka Village. My skis were in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/04/packing-for-ski-touring.html">Douchebag</a> and our clothes in the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/arcteryx-v110-rolling-duffel-luggage/?pid=10239">Arc’teryx V110 Rolling Duffle</a> which made it easy for me to pull all our stuff while my son only had to carry his own backpack. Once we checked in to our room - a very nice apartment with our own kitchen, Sauna and two bed rooms - we went for a walk to the supermarket in the village to get some Müsli and dinner, and as we were sitting for 9 hours on our butts it also was good to go for a walk in the village, and explore more of Ruka, before going to our Sauna and hitting the hay - because we had some full, exciting days ahead for us =)</p>

<h2 id="skiing">Skiing</h2>

<p><strong>Or: Getting ready for off-piste adventures</strong></p>

<p>Day 1 in Ruka, and our first stop after breakfast is the <a href="https://ski.ruka.fi/en/pisterental">Piste Rental Shop</a> in the Village to pick up my son’s skis and our ski passes. Getting the gear is a fast affair and 10 Minutes later we’re outside again, sitting in the Gondola to Ruka Valley my son has a refresher session with <a href="https://new.ruka.fi/en/ski-school">Ruka Ski School</a>. We start on the brand-new Rosa &amp; Rudolf Slopes, where five belt lifts bring ski and snowboard beginners to the top of the fenced-in slope. After two runs the ski school teacher decides we will go to the real slopes right away as the young student is good enough.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49546859573/in/dateposted-public/" title="Rosa &amp; Rudolf Ski Park"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49546859573_6fbbc3d591_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Rosa &amp; Rudolf Ski Park" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547587057/in/dateposted-public/" title="At the new Ruka Kids slope"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547587057_3f44a14c98_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="At the new Ruka Kids slope" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547587437/in/dateposted-public/" title="On the hill"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547587437_e110d40358_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="On the hill" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After an hour on the slopes and having skied down some red and blue slopes it’s time to explore the ski resort on our own, with the tips and advice from our great ski school teacher in mind. The one thing I love about Ruka Ski Resort is how easy it is to explore the different sides and hills of the area, and I take my son towards Maasto, the <em>“Off-the-beaten-track”</em> slopes in the east of the area. There’s substantially fewer people here skiing - and in the middle of January there’s already <em>REALLY</em> few people here! But we like it more silent, and the landscape with the snow-covered trees is here especially pretty, and there’s no-one waiting at the T-lift at the bottom of the slope either.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49546859283/in/dateposted-public/" title="hanging"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49546859283_367ef9e9ce_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="hanging" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547588942/in/dateposted-public/" title="Lighten up!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547588942_f93abf85f7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lighten up!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547362996/in/dateposted-public/" title="Downhill"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547362996_ceb4712b25_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Downhill" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And that’s how we spent several hours of the week each day. My son is a careful skier, and once we identified his favourite runs we would hit these first thing every day and then ski from left to right and back across the whole resort. We had some short breaks at the various huts or the Cafés along the slope, refilling energy levels with a hot chocolate and some Pulla, before it was back to the chair or T-Bar lifts and enjoy the finely prepared slopes anew.</p>

<p>Night skiing is a thing when the sun goes up at 10:30 am and sets at 2:00 pm, and thanks to very well illuminated slopes it’s not a problem at all to ski in darkness. This is especially useful when a parent still has energy to go skiing while a child would rather read comics at home 😉</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547364316/in/dateposted-public/" title="#7"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547364316_44bb26e52f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="#7" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Overall I really had a great time skiing with my son at Ruka Ski Resort. I love the variety of runs and how easy it is to hit some off-piste terrain between the slopes. There are also enough easy routes and slopes which see less people, which makes it ideal if you’re there with kids.</p>

<h2 id="ice-fishing">Ice-fishing</h2>

<p><strong>Or: Learning to wait for the bait</strong></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547592972/in/dateposted-public/" title="Lake"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547592972_3ce980d304_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lake" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Besides daily skiing in the Ski resort we also had some other activities while we were in Ruka. One which my son and me enjoyed a lot was the visit to the <a href="https://www.palosaarenporotila.fi/en/">Reindeer and Fishing Farm Palosaari</a> closer to Kuusamo. We started our visit off with a ride on the reindeer sled, which was a lot of fun and my son got his <strong>Reindeer Driving License</strong> that day 😊</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547366726/in/dateposted-public/" title="On the sled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547366726_f1e976b1f4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="On the sled" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We continued down to the lake. This was an oasis of peace for me - I’m very sensitive to noise, and over here there was no disturbing noise as I hear it every day in the city. Out here on this calm lake there was only the wind which moved the snow-covered branches, and the occasional chirping of some Siberian Jays. Other than that there was only silence. Beautiful, natural silence.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547593567/in/dateposted-public/" title="Ice fishing"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547593567_93955f3311_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ice fishing" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Owner Mika showed us how to drill holes into the ice, clean the hole from slushy ice water, and then how to move our rods to entice the trout and bass in the lake to <em>go on the hook</em>. We discussed strategies - does it make sense to move every five minutes if you don’t have a contact or should you remain stationary for hours to wait till the fish come and visit you? The answer is, it depends. On the lake, you, the weather and temperature and the fish in the lake.</p>

<p>We adopted a strategy of moving every 20 to 30 minutes, but even after a few times of drilling new holes and trying our best to present the bait in the most tasty fashion, no fish was around to fall for our tasty maggots and shiny baits. Ah well, a good thing that Mika had a back-up plan 😉 After a few hours out on the lake we walked up to the lean-to shelter, where a fire was already burning and hot juice &amp; coffee as well as tasty, home-made treats were served. We sat around the fire, discussed developments in the region and how they affect reindeer farmers and tourism in the area, and again I was left wondering while our politicans make decisions which no one I spoke to wants, and which only benefit large multi-national companies, to the detriment of the local environment and people. I finished up my second cup of tasty coffee and then we walked back to the lake, with new motivation and hope to catch one of these elusive inhabitants of the lake.</p>

<p>Alas, also after another hour on the lake, moving and drilling several new holes into the ice, we had to admit that the fish were too smart for us (or simply not hungry 😃), as we didn’t catch a single one of them. However, my son, Anna-Riitta, Mika and me, we had a great time here on the silent lake, and so we were not at all disappointed when we packed up our fishing gear and headed back to the farm. Mika handed us our <a href="https://www.palosaarenporotila.fi/en/">Reindeer and Fishing Farm Palosaari</a> Reindeer Driving license, which now allows us to manoeuvre sleds pulled by Rudolf and his siblings, and then we made us on the way back to Ruka and hit the slopes for some afternoon skiing!</p>

<h2 id="ice-climbing">Ice climbing</h2>

<p><strong>Or: Why am I still this good?</strong></p>

<p>The long-time reader knows <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/ice-climbing-in-korouoma.html">I love ice climbing</a> but also is likely aware that I haven’t climbed much ice in recent years. The winters have been bad, I have discovered skitouring as a beautiful way to explore the outdoors in winter, and I also don’t have a lot of friends that climb ice anymore.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49546854623/in/dateposted-public/" title="Gondel Cabins"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49546854623_bfd21b191e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Gondel Cabins" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That all would change during our visit to Ruka, and to top things off my 8-year old son would also get to climb his first ice route! <a href="https://www.outdoorpassion.fi/en/">Outdoor Passion Finland</a>, which is run by Jussi and his wife Lotta, took us under their wings and both thought my son and rekindled my love for ice climbing. Lotta and Jussi are perfect with kids, and after we were kitted out with crampons, gaiters, harness, helmets and ice tools we hiked like John Wayne to the ice fall, which is in the middle of the ski resort and a spectacular 35 m high. But before we were allowed to climb, Jussi gave us a introduction to climbing on ice, from foot and tool placement to how to get back down.</p>

<p>My son was very brave and climbed his route really well, and I am very proud of him that he climbed this ice fall! I too did some ice climbing, and surprised myself quite a bit as I seemed to be able to climb the different routes without any issues. I haven’t climbed ice (or rock, or plastic 😟) in the past two years, so it was a bit of a shock that even on the steep route I had no problem with placing tools and crampons, climbing onto smaller ledges, and that there were also no screaming barfies. I even raced up the simplest route and got to the anchor in under two minutes…</p>

<p>After all the climbing Lotta and Jussi took us to explore the Ground-Ferrata which they had built in the nearby forest. It’s basically a track which takes you through the snow-covered forest, through the snow-covered spruce trees 🌲 ❤️ and back to the ice wall. It was simple, but very beautiful and a great experience to go through the snow tunnel under the tree and climb back out!</p>

<h2 id="xc-skiing">XC Skiing</h2>

<p><strong>Or: There and Back again</strong></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547369956/in/dateposted-public/" title="XC skiing"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547369956_11f93fc12d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="XC skiing" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On our last full day in Ruka we decided to go XC skiing. My son usually goes XC skiing at school, but due to climate change and the ongoing disastrous winter winter we have in Vaasa he hasn’t been even once skiing with school, and as it is also an activity I enjoy a lot I felt it would be a good thing to do. What I didn’t account for was the strong, cold wind which was blowing across Lapland that morning, and which would bring a lot more snow over the following days to the North of the country…</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547596542/in/dateposted-public/" title="XC skiing 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547596542_608363c97a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="XC skiing 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We started again at the <a href="https://ski.ruka.fi/en/pisterental">Piste Rental Shop</a> where we loaned our XC skiing gear, and then we took the Gondola to Ruka Valley from where we would ski around 3,5 km to a Café. So far the plan. The reality was that the weather really wasn’t very favourable, as we were skiing into the wind and snow, which my son didn’t enjoy particularly much. However, with the promise of a hot chocolate and pancakes or waffles we made it in the end to the small, cozy Café, where we enjoyed our break.</p>

<p>The way back, as these things usually go, was easier. With the wind in our back, and some tasty treats in our bellies, as well as some gentle, fun downhills, we were back at the Gondola Station in Ruka Valley in some 30 minutes! We were also really lucky as just as we arrived a Gondola came in, and so we were sitting down in one of the cabins to get back to Ruka Village.</p>

<p><strong>Or: Did you see that?!</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://lightfestival.fi">Polar Night Light Festival</a> is an annual Festival which transforms the slopes of Ruka into a colourful wonderland, with amazing light installations all across the village and slopes. It’s always in January as then it is still really dark up North, and definitely worth a visit. As a photographer I absolutely loved to see this Festival, and I highly recommend you take a good Tripod, footwear with good grip and warm clothes along if you plan to photograph them, as it does get cold on the slopes at night. Also take care of the Pistenbullies and snowmobiles which might ride on the slopes at night and prepare everything for skiers and snowboarders! Of course you also can just enjoy the installations when you go skiing after the sun set at 2:00 pm 😆</p>

<h2 id="being-a-good-parent">Being a good parent</h2>

<p><strong>Or: Learning to put others first</strong></p>

<p>My son and me, we can be like water &amp; fire, OR then we can be best friends. When it is just the two of us, and he gets all my attention, things definitely are a lot easier and we get along really well. I also am more relaxed, and try to remember to put his wants &amp; needs before mine. For example, if he gets tired or has no motivation to hit the slopes after a while, I usually have a hard time to accept that, but the smart, emphatic side of my brain then tells me to just let him go back to the apartment and chill &amp; read comics, while I continue to ski. That way be both are happy, and skiing (or other activities) don’t get a bad connotation for him, which means in the long-run he’s more likely to enjoy these activities as much as me. After all, we were here to have a good time together, and when one is not enjoying something it’s not smart to force him to do it. With high costs for renting gear and lift passes it’s easy to forget these things, but in the long-term I feel it’s better for all involved, and it definitely worked well for us on this and past trips.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-eat--where-to-stay">What to Eat &amp; Where to Stay</h2>

<p>We stayed at the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/rukasuites">Ski Inn</a> in the centre of Ruka Village, and had a super-nice apartment. We enjoyed the Sauna every evening together, and the small kitchen was all I needed to cook some simple meals for us two. The Supermarket was a stone-throw away, as were a handful of restaurants and Cafés. There are plenty more <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/where-to-stay">places to stay in Ruka</a> for any budget, and especially the brand-new <a href="https://www.ski-inn.fi/en/majoitus/ruka/hotel-rukavalley">Ruka Valley</a> Hotel &amp; Apartments look like a great choice for families as the Kids Slope are in front of the building!</p>

<p>We ate in a variety of places during our stay, from the new <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/campkitchen">CAMP Kitchen</a> which serves a super-tasty Vegan Bowl and a good kids Burger, to <a href="https://ruokburger.fi">RUOK</a> and <a href="http://www.hankibaari.fi">Hankibaari</a> which have very good options for people with all kind of diets. We also cooked at least once a day in our apartment, basics like Pesto-Pasta and Pizza kept the food expenses low and were really good, too!</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-ruka">Getting to Ruka</h2>

<p>As I have <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/04/spring-skiing-in-ruka.html">said in the past</a>: The most convenient way is to take the <a href="http://vr.fi">train</a> and <a href="https://matkahuolto.fi">bus</a> to Ruka, or if you come from abroad you can fly to the <a href="https://www.finavia.fi/en/airports/kuusamo">Kuusamo Airport</a> and take the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/getting-around">Ski Bus</a> to the village and Ruka Valley. In the winter <a href="https://www.onnibus.com/">OnniBus</a> has direct connections from the south to Ruka which are really affordable and a really good option as one doesn’t need to change. On the train you can sleep, work and walk around, and during the bus trip you can enjoy the beautiful Finnish landscape while listening to your favourite tunes. We downloaded the Finnish version of the Donald Duck Comic magazine which allowed us to download hundreds of comics to the iPad, which made for a relaxing trip as my son was reading hours at a time on the bus &amp; train. Also some salty and sweet treats were handed out every now and then, and longer breaks were scheduled in so we didn’t need to stress in case a train or bus were running late.</p>

<p>The skiing season 2020 started in Ruka for me, and I was really happy to have my 8-year old son along. These kind of trips are great to bond with the kids, learn more about them, and of course also share my passion for the outdoors with them. Plenty of hot chocolates where consumed, Pokemons were caught, and of course we also had a lot of fun on the slopes of the <a href="https://www.ruka.fi/en/">Ruka Ski Resort</a>!</p>

<p>Besides skiing the slopes every day, we also had a few activities planned. Ice climbing with <a href="https://www.outdoorpassion.fi/en/">Outdoor Passion Finland</a> for example.</p>

<p>I’m a cyclist, and on my backpacking and work trips riding my bike is one of the few things I miss. I like the speed, the new perspective on things, the ability to see more in a shorter amount of time. It’s great, fun, too! So when I saw that one of my <a href="https://polarlifeoutdoor.com">Polarlife Outdoors</a> activities would be to go ride Mountainbike in the fjells, I was really happy and excited. <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/active-holidays-in-are-sweden.html">Last year in Åre</a> I learned to ride downhill mountainbiking and I have looked forward to another opportunity to ride a bike in the hills of Lapland.</p>

<p>The forecast for the day was grey and rainy, but tht did not dampen my spirit. I met up with Reima &amp; Tiina from <a href="https://saariselkatraining.com">Saariselkä Training</a> and Anni at the bike shed, where we got our bikes, and then we were altogether off to the hills!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743767481/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="MTB with Saariselkä Training"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743767481_bba94c15a3_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="MTB with Saariselkä Training" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now this was not a downhill ride. We powered up the fjell with our own power (no eBike or gondola!) and rode from wide, easy paths over swampy duckboard sections to a very short stoney trail to the summit on many different kinds of terrain, which is excellent for beginners like me. That way the trail got a little more demanding the higher we got, and once at the summit it was wide views, happy high-fives, and getting excited about the downhill ride.</p>

<p>As these things tend to go, by the time we rolled towards the single trail the weather decided it was time for a bit more moisture, and so a light drizzle started to accompany us on our way down. This did not curb our enthusiasm for the singletrail, though! Reima and Tiina were shredding fast down their home trails, and I was hollering with joy in the beautiful nature!</p>

<p>After a way too short section of easy downhill singletrail Tiina &amp; Reima guided us on gorgeous paths through the autumnal forest. Pine needles from many years made these trails soft and enjoyable, with little curves, small ups &amp; downs, and around us the forest with all the beautiful colours of red, orange, yellow and green.</p>

<p>Sadly also this delightful forest ride was over too quickly, as we arrived at a cozy Kota, where Reima brewed us a fine coffee and and we ate some home-made cake. This is such a nice touch, eating real, home-made food outdoors, and drinking good coffee, and in hindsight it seemed to be a unifying thing between all the Polarlife Outdoors activities I did that week: Tasty food, prepared at home, enjoyed with kind people, in nature.</p>

<p>We chatted about cycling, the outdoors and life in the North during our coffee break, and then saddled our bikes for a final time as we had a short ride back to the village in front of us. We continued our chats on the bike, and it made me want to go for another mountainbike trip here with these two in the beautiful nature of Lapland. Reima and Tiina were excellent guides, very calm, friendly and down-to-earth - I really enjoyed spending time with them, riding in and around the woods &amp; hills of the Urho Kekkonen National Park, and I hope to ride again with them the next time I visit Saariselkä 😊</p>

<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities!</h2>

<p>I stayed in Saariselkä, which is probably <em>THE</em> place to be when you want to explore the North-Eastern corner of Finnish Lapland. Besides a dozen or more options for accommodation options - I stayed at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fi/lapland-riekonlinna.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna‎</a> - the village lays right at the border of the Urho Kekkonen National Park and is just a short 2 hour stroll away from the Hammastunturi Wilderness Area. This means you don’t need a car to go outdoors in Saariselkä, as you can walk in a few minutes from your Hotel or log cabin to the start of a trail. Here’s the <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=900040403&amp;aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&amp;room1=A">full list of Hotels and Cabins in Saariselkä</a>, and feel free to use that Affiliate Link when you’re making a reservation!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743375433/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna Room"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743375433_e869ca2dad_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna Room" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Getting to Saariselkä happens in one of three ways: You drive your car north for a veeeeeeery long time but are mobile there. Useful if you want to drive to different places, but hopefully you’re not alone in that car! The second and best option is to take the train and Bus. Taking the Bus from Rovaniemi to Saariselkä is a short and scenic 3 hour ride, and it really gets you in the mood for the outdoors as you ride past lakes and forests and every so often slow down to let the Reindeer get off the road. Taking an (overnight) train to Rovaniemi from Southern Finland is also very convenient, as you wake up well rested and just a short ride away from your next outdoor adventure. This is also a good way to travel if you want to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/outdoors-in-helsinki.html">explore Helsinki</a> before or after a visit in Lapland. Finally, if you come from abroad you also can fly directly to Ivalo, from where you can take a bus or Taxi to Saariselkä.</p>

<p>Saariselkä has for a village its size a variety of different options for eating out, from Anne’s Garden which serves delicious Burgers (great for backpackers who just returned to civilization!) to fine dining at Santa’s Hotel Tunturi and Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna‎ or the tasty Buffet at the Holiday Club. Cafe Porotupa at the market square makes really good coffee (On a side note, I’m always baffled how much bad coffee you get served in a variety of places in Finland, the World Champion in coffee consumption) and also fresh pancakes and cakes. If you rather cook yourself, then the supermarket in the village has everything you need, or if you need to stock-up on dehydrated meals for another backpacking trip then visit the <a href="https://www.partioaitta.fi/myymalat/saariselka/">Partioaitta Saariselkä</a>, probably the most-northern Outdoor Store in Finland!</p>

<p>During my visit at Saariselkä I participated in many different <a href="https://polarlifeoutdoor.com">Polarlife Outdoors</a> activities, include going to the Sauna and Spa at the Holiday Club, hiking on one of the dozen of trails around the village, visiting the AMAZING Aurora Open Wilderness Hut when you want to see Northern Lights, participate in a wild herbs Workshop, visit a Sauna and going to swim in a stream, or rent a Mountainbike and explore one of the many single track trails and holler with joy when you ride down the fjell!

<p>We rolled into the <a href="https://arcticskylapland.com">Arctic Sky</a> parking lot and I immediately felt like this is a good place. Beautiful wooden buildings, a herb garden on the side, and a traditional <em>Kota</em> being built to gather in in the evenings. Minna welcomed us in, and it almost felt like I entered my own home. Minna and her partner Aarno have built this small resort - ten people can stay here – from 400 year old lumber which they picked up in southern Finland and transported here to the far North, and then continued to decorate their house and the Guesthouse in a wonderful cozy style, from the hand-made woolen socks which you can slip into at the door to the beautiful animal prints which give each of the five guest rooms their names. Yes, you can stay at Arctic Sky, but I was here for an introduction to nordic Herbs and then some searching and cooking some wild food, as part of my <a href="https://polarlifeoutdoor.com">Polarlife Outdoors</a> experience.</p>

<p>So after a look through the cozy house we shouldered our packs, grabbed each a woven basket and headed into the woods to find some Mushrooms, pick berries, and hike to a Laavu to prepare our findings into a tasty meal.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743747866/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Shrooms"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743747866_b4380edc27_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Shrooms" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743750446/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Red"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743750446_02ed691429_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Red" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743926902/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Bilberries"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743926902_e6243172ec_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Bilberries" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We hiked on the Ruijanpolku, a trail I didn’t exist, and which is a rather old and long trail. I might need to return to go backpacking on it some day in the future, but right now I was more occupied with finding tasty mushrooms and bilberries for our desert. It’s funny how I can completely can zoom-in on searching mushrooms, and the hunter &amp; gatherer in me is also one which isn’t happy with having a full basket of mushrooms - I always want to find more 😃</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743926192/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Ruijanpolku"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743926192_314866f63c_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Ruijanpolku" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After a very successful search for mushrooms, and learning to identify a few new ones (that is one of the benefits of going mushroom picking with someone!) we arrived at a very wonderful Laavu next to a lovely stream. We weren’t alone, though - many dayhikers enjoyed this beautiful spot, eating snacks, drinking tea, and grilling sausages. Also, I made a new friend.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743934682/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Siberian Jay"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743934682_c54826a8dd_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Siberian Jay" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>While I was busy snapping the next Konsta Punkka image Minna was busy preparing our food.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743752121/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Preparing shrooms"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743752121_1ba5987ca0_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Preparing shrooms" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The smell of mushrooms which sizzle over the fire in a pan is something so mouth-watering, just the thought of them makes me want to grab my coat and head out into the forest to go find some mushrooms!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743417398/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Tasty starter!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743417398_fae60f2fe5_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Tasty starter!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But while the mushrooms were frying in the pan we ate our starter, which we prepared ourselves from the things Minna brought along. We garnished it with some of the herbs we picked in her garden, and yes, it was as tasty as it looks!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743418023/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Even more tasty Main!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743418023_2549c115da_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Even more tasty Main!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then it was time for the main course, our fried mushrooms were served with a vegan nettle pancake and some again we could use the different herbs we picked earlier to garnish it. These mushroom pancakes were so tasty that I ate three of them - just so much to leave some space for the dessert!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743419953/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Dessert Volume II"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743419953_65b9833a8c_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Dessert Volume II" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A lingonberry mousse in a dark chocolate coat, together with a bilberry sauce which we prepared from the berries we picked along the way. Oh my, this indeed was a sweet finish to an outstanding meal! If you now feel hungry - then no worries, Minna is happy to take you out on a hike like this! When you stay with Minna and Aarno at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fi/arctic-sky-lapland.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Arctic Sky Resort</a> you can pick and choose from a <a href="https://arcticskylapland.com/your-own-arctic-wellness-week">great variety of activities</a>, including the one you just read about! I definitely would recommend going with a few friends or the family, that way you can enjoy sitting in the cozy kitchen in the evenings, play some UNO or another board game, and chat while it slowly gets dark outside!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743758731/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Wood"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743758731_5c2a1e9a1b_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Wood" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After all that tasty food and the hike back I got a ride to the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fi/muotka-igloos.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Wilderness Hotel Muotka</a>, but not to lay down and rest - nope. I did the most typical thing you can do in Finland: Going to Sauna.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48826135788/in/dateposted/" title="Sauna Timelapse"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48826135788_6662724415_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Sauna Timelapse" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743942342/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Sauna Stream"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743942342_701dd2e6f2_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Sauna Stream" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now while I didn’t much enjoy my river crossings in the Hammastunturi Wilderness, at Muotka I even went to swim in the stream several times! I reckon if a warm Sauna and dry clothes are waiting for you, going into a cold stream is less of an issue 😃 Obviously going to chill by a fireplace in the sun afterwards makes a dip in the cold stream even less of a problem.</p>

<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities!</h2>

<p>I stayed in Saariselkä, which is probably <em>THE</em> place to be when you want to explore the North-Eastern corner of Finnish Lapland - or you stay at <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fi/arctic-sky-lapland.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Arctic Sky</a> if you want to be enjoy a more silent stay. Besides a dozen or more options for accommodation options - I stayed at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fi/lapland-riekonlinna.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna‎</a> - the village lays right at the border of the Urho Kekkonen National Park and is just a short 2 hour stroll away from the Hammastunturi Wilderness Area. This means you don’t need a car to go outdoors in Saariselkä, as you can walk in a few minutes from your Hotel or log cabin to the start of a trail. Here’s the <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=900040403&amp;aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&amp;room1=A">full list of Hotels and Cabins in Saariselkä</a>, and feel free to use that Affiliate Link when you’re making a reservation!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743375433/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna Room"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743375433_e869ca2dad_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna Room" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Getting to Saariselkä happens in one of three ways: You drive your car north for a veeeeeeery long time but are mobile there. Useful if you want to drive to different places, but hopefully you’re not alone in that car! The second and best option is to take the train and Bus. Taking the Bus from Rovaniemi to Saariselkä is a short and scenic 3 hour ride, and it really gets you in the mood for the outdoors as you ride past lakes and forests and every so often slow down to let the Reindeer get off the road. Taking an (overnight) train to Rovaniemi from Southern Finland is also very convenient, as you wake up well rested and just a short ride away from your next outdoor adventure. This is also a good way to travel if you want to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/outdoors-in-helsinki.html">explore Helsinki</a> before or after a visit in Lapland. Finally, if you come from abroad you also can fly directly to Ivalo, from where you can take a bus or Taxi to Saariselkä.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/0i3st0" title="Oulu - Tromso"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48780910708_729d052bdf_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="Oulu - Tromso" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Saariselkä has for a village its size a variety of different options for eating out, from Anne’s Garden which serves delicious Burgers (great for backpackers who just returned to civilization!) to fine dining at Santa’s Hotel Tunturi and Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna‎ or the tasty Buffet at the Holiday Club. Cafe Porotupa at the market square makes really good coffee (On a side note, I’m always baffled how much bad coffee you get served in a variety of places in Finland, the World Champion in coffee consumption) and also fresh pancakes and cakes. If you rather cook yourself, then the supermarket in the village has everything you need, or if you need to stock-up on dehydrated meals for another backpacking trip then visit the <a href="https://www.partioaitta.fi/myymalat/saariselka/">Partioaitta Saariselkä</a>, probably the most-northern Outdoor Store in Finland!</p>

<p>During my visit at Saariselkä I participated in many different <a href="https://polarlifeoutdoor.com">Polarlife Outdoors</a> activities, include going to the Sauna and Spa at the Holiday Club, hiking on one of the dozen of trails around the village, visiting the AMAZING Aurora Open Wilderness Hut when you want to see Northern Lights, participate in a wild herbs Workshop, visit a Sauna and going to swim in a stream, or rent a Mountainbike and explore one of the many single track trails and holler with joy when you ride down the fjell!
