    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Levi is known as a Ski Mecca in Finland, with Levitunturi being an amazing mountain with 360° views over Lapland and slopes going down in every direction. That this village also is worth visiting in the summer and autumn is a little known fact outside of Finland - and even here not many people know that Levi is a great destination for active people and families in the summer!</p>

<p>Levitunturi, which means the “fjell of Levi” in Finnish, is a 531 m high hill which stands almost on its own in the south of Lapland. Go just a few hundred meters up and already you get amazing views on the surrounding landscape: The gorgeous Pallas mountains to the North-West, the Ylläs mountains are just some 35-ish kilometres far away to the West, as well as lakes, smaller fjells and lots &amp; lots of forests. Nestled at the Northern aspect of the mountain is the small village of Sirkka, which is the home base for almost all guests and businesses. From here you can take the Gondel up the mountain and ride on the Summer Sled Track back down, or go for a hike on one of the various trails which take you across and around the mountain.</p>

<h2 id="mountainbiking-in-and-around-levi">Mountainbiking in and around Levi</h2>

<p>Levi is known for its Bike Park, to which I will come in a moment, but also for those who look for less downhill thrill on a bike Levi has plenty to offer: A large mountain bike trail network, which allows for fun day trips on single and forest trails. I tested a section of the Levi Tunturi Trail, a 18-ish km long trail which takes you around the Levitunturi mountain, and really enjoyed how well-maintained this trail is. Some might say it’s more a highway than a trail - but then I have seen many trails which have destroyed the nature around it as more &amp; more people are riding on it; so a well-maintained trails in my experience much preferable in such a situation.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51399115323/in/album-72157719614510730/" title="MTBing in Levi"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51399115323_d4b853f929_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="MTBing in Levi" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And especially with kids who just start to ride off-road these kind of trails are an ideal choice for riding their mountain bikes safely. Even for experienced riders I think the round around Levitunturi will be fun and rewarding, especially if you take a competitive approach to it and see how fast you’re able to complete the trail! Besides this trail there many more, for example could you ride to Ylläs and back, or even go bike packing and explore the less visited places around Levi with the bike.</p>

<p>Within Levi you most certainly don’t need a car as the village is very compact, though if you want to speed things up you can take your bike to get around town. We used our four loan bikes to ride to the Levi Bike and Activity Park, which was a short 3 km ride from where we stayed and no problem for our five-year old.</p>

<h2 id="levi-with-small-kids">Levi with small kids</h2>

<p>Speaking of our five-year-old, Levi does have plenty to offer for smaller kids which might not yet ready to ride down steep downhill trails. The <a href="https://www.levi.ski/en/summer/adventurepark">Adventure Park</a> at Gondolintie 1 for example has plenty of free options for toddlers and small kids, like a really fantastic play ground, a small Zipline parkour at ground level and the pedal-powered cars which our daughter really loved. All these are free and really fun in warm sunny weather - just make sure to bring sunscreen along as there’s almost no shade!</p>

<p>The large Zipline Parkour is for kids over 115 cm and my son and wife enjoyed this adrenaline-filled activity. There’s an introduction trail where you under supervision learn how to climb and use the different functions, and then you can pick one of several different routes - from zip lining almost 1.000 m or climbing really fun obstacles. It looked super-fun and I hope on our next visit to Levi our daughter is tall enough so her and me also can join in the fun!</p>

<p>On our last day we visited the <a href="https://www.elvesvillage.fi">Tonttula Elves Village</a> which is a bit outside of Sirkka, so we took a short taxi ride there. Here you can participate in a guided tour where you craft holiday decorations, bake gingerbread cookies - which our kids absolutely loved - and visit the large cave. There were also several farm animals around which you could pet. We also ate lunch here, and took a small hike on their forest trail. Overall the visit was very nice, even when it was July and the holiday feeling felt a tad out-of-season for us parents, though nevertheless it was fun and the kids loved it.</p>

<h2 id="levi-bike-park">Levi Bike Park</h2>

<p>After seeing my friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kaddi_kestler/">Kaddi</a> loving Downhill MTBing so much I gave in a few years ago and learned thanks to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/active-holidays-in-are-sweden.html">Jesper</a> in Åre how to ride a MTB down steep hills. It’s absolutely thrilling and a lot of fun, and actually a lot easier and safer as it might look. So I was very excited to go Downhill riding with my son in <a href="https://www.levi.ski/en/summer/bikepark">Levi Bike Park</a>, which is one of Finland’s oldest Bike Parks.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51395761002/in/album-72157719614510730/" title="Village Trail 015"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51395761002_a2bde68f5c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Village Trail 015" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We started off with picking up our Downhill Bikes at the Levi Bike Park Shop, where we also picked up all our protective gear - from <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/poc-joint-vpd-20-knee-protektor/?pid=10239">∞ POC Knee Protectors</a> over the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/poc-oseus-vpd-torso-protektor/?pid=10239">∞ POC Body Harnesses</a> and Helmets to <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/poc-resistance-enduro-glove-handschuhe/?pid=10239">∞ Gloves</a> and Shirts. After that we met our Instructor <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pietoerna/">Pieto</a> who also is a Trail Builder in Levi. Our group of six was very varied, but Pieto was able to accommodate all our different skill levels and also as a rider with some experience I learned and improved my technique during this class.</p>

<p>After some flat land techniques and getting familiar with our bikes we took the Gondola up the mountain, where we rode down the Village Trail, a Green Trail which is excellent for beginners - and thrown in some amazing Views and fun features and I think this will become a popular trail!</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/47vuHwjjPfM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>We rode the trail in sections and made several stops, where we had different “clinics” like learning to ride Berms the correct way and how to ride waves. After we finished the Village Trail back at the Levi Activity Centre we took the Gondola back up once more and then rode the Blue Groove Trail, which is one of Levi’s most popular trails with many great Berms and exciting features - all on a easy Blue Trail level.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51396780103/in/album-72157719614510730/" title="Learning to ride Berms"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51396780103_ece28dabeb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Learning to ride Berms" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51396515306/in/album-72157719614510730/" title="Village Trail 3"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51396515306_3d292ae24c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Village Trail 3" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the afternoon my son and me rode with Pieto a couple more times the Village Trail and then the South Route, which we had for ourselves. Overall, while there was a constant flow of riders and bikes going up the mountain the trails were what I would consider empty - it was easy enough even on popular trails like Blue Groove to stop and shoot photos without anyone breathing down our neck. With over ten downhill trails of different levels the riders simply seem to distribute evenly across them, which is also great news for slower riders who might not enjoy the feeling of slowing others down.</p>

<p>During our two days of riding in Levi Bike Park we had many great rides with my son, and he shredded down the different trails without fear and with good technique after just one instruction session. He told me that he liked the experience and since we returned home he has been out with his <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/07/woom-off-off-review.html">woom OFF Air</a> out on the local trails, having fun.</p>

<p>On a short side-note, many Ski Centres around the globe are closed during the summers and the villages are devoid of people. This is not good for the local communities, hence I am much in favour of villages where you can life year-around. Services like the Levi Bike Park make it possible that Hotels, Restaurants and also the expensive Gondola and Lifts infrastructure do not need to be closed down and stand still once the ski season is over. Because of such and other services the small village of Sirkka is open year-around and people can make a living here from January till December.</p>

<h2 id="hiking-in-levi">Hiking in Levi</h2>

<p>Most evenings I went out for a shorter or longer hike up Levitunturi. I love the long Golden Hour you have in Lapland in the summer, and my photographer heart was full of joy about the amazing weather and views in the evenings. There are a handful of marked trails going up and around the mountain, but I usually didn’t follow any particular trail and simply explored. I liked visiting Santa’s Cabin, going to the Summit, and simply following small trails which looked interesting. If you want more guidance, then there is for example an Ice Age Trail, which tells more about the history of how these mountains came to be. Of course there’s many more trails for hiking around Levi - a look at Retkikartta will help you find and explore them!</p>

<h2 id="services-in-the-village">Services in the village</h2>

<p>Back in Sirkka with its compact centre you find many different shops and services. One service the kids and me really liked was the <a href="https://www.levi.ski/en/summer/summersledding">Summer Sled Track</a> which you can ride either alone or on a 2-Person sled. It’s a popular activity and going earlier in the morning or in the early afternoon is recommended, as after 16 o’clock it does get busy and you can wait up to an hour that you get up and down (because of the COVID-19 restrictions only people from the same family/ group are allowed into on Gondola cabin).</p>

<p>We loaned our four bikes from the <a href="https://www.levi.ski/en/summer/equipmentrental">Zero Point Store</a> down by the Slopes in Sirkka. We informed them of our heights and needs in advance online, and just had to test fit the bikes - all were the correct size - and then got our loan helmets and could start cycling. They have bikes for kids of all ages, and for example our daughter was very excited about her pink Trek Bike!</p>

<p>In the Tourist Information you can book activities, accommodation and get tickets for the lifts, and in the same street you find sport shops in case you forgot something important at home. There’s a couple of Cafés for an afternoon snack and coffee as well as several Restaurants if you have more hunger. As we had a kitchen in our apartment we bought food at the S-Market Supermarket in the centre and prepared meals at home.</p>

<p>As I don’t drink alcohol anymore I didn’t have any need to visit some of the bars and nightclubs which are in Levi, though if you fancy a cold pint of beer after a thrilling day on the downhill trails then there’s the possibility to do so!</p>

<h2 id="where-to-stay">Where to stay</h2>

<p>We stayed in a spacious apartment at <a href="https://www.hulluporo.fi/en/">Hullu Poro Hotel</a>. It’s a five minute walk from the centre, the bus stops right in front of it when you arrive and leave, and it has a small Spa with a Sauna and Hot tub which the kids enjoyed going to every evening. Our apartment could accommodate up to six persons - there were three bedrooms, two showers and WCs, with a small kitchen and a nice eating and living room area. We also had an own Sauna, but as it was quite warm we didn’t use it. It was a comfortable base for us four, and the included breakfast was very good.</p>

<p>There are several more accommodation options available, so best is to check out the <a href="https://www.levi.fi/en/accommodation.html?__hstc=222398596.5f194482a517902a3e519b566ac3564c.1629786273581.1629786273581.1629786273581.1&amp;__hssc=222398596.4.1629786273581&amp;__hsfp=1451467367">Accommodations</a> website from Levi.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-here">How to get here</h2>

<p>We travelled by train and bus to Levi, via <a href="">Rovaniemi</a> where we slept a night in the Hostel Café Koti. This allowed us to have shorter travel days and explore a bit of Rovaniemi, for example the fantastic (free!) Angry Birds playground. We spent several hours here, with the kids playing on the many [check what lapses calls the “installations”/ telinät]. There’s also a Futbol court and you can loan balls, so the kids and me also kicked some balls there.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/15v5xX" title="Angry Birds Park in Rovaniemi"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51399203368_0641ace52c_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Angry Birds Park in Rovaniemi" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But yeah, Bus and Train. We took the Train from Vaasa to Rovaniemi and back, which was affordable if you book early - we spent 75,00 € going-return for our train tickets. The trip takes between 6 and 8 hours with two transfers for us, but with some card games, audiobooks and some additional screen time it’s easy to make the journey pleasant for all. The Bus from Rovaniemi to Levi and back was more expensive than the train for a single journey, but only took around 3 hours.</p>

<p>You can fly to Kittilä with Finnair, which is the fastest possibility. Flights are still limited and apparently also bit more expensive, so if you want to travel by plane to Levi make sure to book in advance. There’s local busses from Kittilä to Levi and back which run in sync with the flights, so getting to Levi and to the airport is easy.</p>

<h2 id="the-gear">The Gear</h2>

<p>We travelled light as usual, with only the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/06/ultralight-family-travel-with-eagle-creek.html">Arc’teryx V110 Duffel</a> and our Eagle Creek Cubes for our four clothes and stuff. I carried my camera gear and MacBook in my trusted <a href="https://bit.ly/2WjccTK">∞ Peak Design Travel Backpack</a>, and also had my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/09/huckepacks-phoenix-lite-review.html">HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite</a> for hiking and the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/vaude-trail-spacer-18-wanderrucksack/?pid=10239">∞ Vaude TrailSpacer 18</a> for all cycling activities along. My favourite piece of kit which I had along was probably my <a href="https://lunasandals.com/?rfsn=35669.8168e">∞ Luna Sandals OSO Flaco</a> and my <a href="https://tidd.ly/3yfTXLM">∞ Houdini Daybreak Shorts</a>, I wear these in the summer ALL THE TIME. As previously mentioned, we loaned the Mountain Bikes and Downhill Bikes + Protective Gear in Levi from the Levi Bike Park Shop (for Downhill Gear) and the MTBs in Sirkka from Zero Point, as it’s easier to travel without bikes by public transportation =)</p>

<h2 id="should-you-go">Should you go?</h2>

<p>Travelling during the on-going COVID-19 Pandemic seems strange, but the reality is that many families need a break. Levi offered a safe travel experience and proper Hygiene &amp; Safety were observed almost everywhere, from the Bike Park Shop to the Gondola Cabins to Cafés, Hotels and Supermarkets. We very much enjoyed our stay in Levi, with interesting and fun activities for kids and adults alike. We especially liked that there were heaps of free activities available around the Adventure Park, and as our kids enjoy cycling it was great to simply explore the surroundings by bike. So if you and your family are looking for an active holiday destination where you also can relax, take a closer look at Levi. With its many different activities, plenty of accommodation options for any wallet and the great views from Levitunturi, it’s certainly a destination which you should keep in mind for your next summer or autumn holiday!</p>

<p>The last time I was in <a href="https://www.levi.fi/en/home-2.html">Levi</a> was in Winter - and I had a great time skiing its slopes and enjoying the views. Now it was summer in Levi, which, thanks to the hightening Climate Emergency, means we had several days where the Thermometer almost showed 30°C - so longsleeves and sunscreen were mandatory. Nevertheless, all four of us had a good time - on foot, on bikes and in the summer sleds! Here are our first impressions from the trip, the rest will follow in a couple of weeks =)</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>If you travel to and from Lapland, plan in an overnight stay in Rovaniemi for less hurry and more relaxation. Hostel Café Koti is the place to sleep if you want comfortable beds and rooms with a Nordic Design, and as it’s in the centre of Rovaniemi you can walk everywhere in a few minutes! A stroll along the shore of the river is a must in Rovaniemi, with scenic views on the city. Visit the Arktikum Museum if you want knowledge and culture, or take a hike up Ounasvaara on the (Winter) Trail. If you need even more action - rent a Fatbike from RollOutdoors!</p>

<h2 id="travelling-north-and-south">Travelling North and South</h2>

<p>When my son and me travelled back from our <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/03/fatbiking-in-saariselka.html">winter holiday in Saariselkä</a> we decided to spend on the way back home an afternoon and night in Rovaniemi - simply as travelling south with public transportation is quite long and difficult to organize in a smooth way (VR and Matkahuolto haven’t realized yet that they could synchronize their schedules).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51170937352/in/dateposted/" title="Rovaniemi Railway Station"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51170937352_c9225fd3aa_h.jpg" width="1200" height="1600" alt="Rovaniemi Railway Station" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So instead of an awfully long travel day with lots of hurry and stress we slept in, ate a good breakfast in our Hotel in Saariselkä, and then took the 11 o’clock Bus to Rovaniemi, where we arrived several hours later. The next day, again after a good breakfast at Hostel Café Koti, we walked with our <a href="https://tidd.ly/2R9MMFx">∞ luggage</a> to the Railway Station and took the train back south. As you can imagine, such a travel arrangement is much more comfortable than a day where you get up at 6 am and are stressed till 22 o’clock when you finally arrive at home. So what did we do in Rovaniemi?</p>

<h2 id="the-capital-of-lapland">The Capital of Lapland</h2>

<p>Our Bus from Saariselkä dropped us off in the centre of Rovaniemi, just a short stroll from our accommodation, the beautiful <a href="https://hostelcafekoti.fi">Hostel Café Koti</a>. This beautiful Hostel is a few years old and is located in a completely renovated bank building - the old offices are now rooms - there’s singles, doubles and family rooms, as well as dormitories. Downstairs you have a Café where breakfast is served and where throughout the day you can drink good coffee and tea, and also enjoy some snacks.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51169792143/in/photostream/" title="Hostel Café Koti"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51169792143_7d001c901c_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Hostel Café Koti" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After checking in we brought the ski bag to the very safe luggage storage - an old strong room - and went to the top floor, where our beautiful room was. While I usually sleep in tents in the middle of nowhere, I do appreciate good design and beautiful interiors, and our room at Koti - which means <em>Home in Finnish</em> - was delightful. Natural materials, natural colours, lots of windows with great views - it’s the kind of room which is very inviting. The beds were fantastic, too - and I already felt like a wee nap wouldn’t be harmful 🥱 But we had some other plans - we wanted to explore wintery Rovaniemi!</p>

<p>Hostel Café Koti is located 2 minutes form the main square of Rovaniemi - but we were headed to the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ibhLU94L868fybGg8">Angry Birds Playground</a> which is also just 300 m away from the Hostel, and was more what we wanted after a day of travelling by Bus. This Playground is free to use, and has many really cool Angry Birds-themed playground equipment - perfect for a child, even if he’s more familiar with other games!</p>

<p>After enjoying the playground we went for a stroll along the shore of the river. If you’re inclined, you also could go XC Skiing here, as there’s a Track going along it. We sticked to walking, and took in the view over to Ounasvaara - a real outdoor paradise if you’re living in the city, where you can go Fatbiking with <a href="https://www.rolloutdoors.com/en/">RollOutdoors</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning</a> and hiking.</p>

<p>We continued more direction town again, though - our stomachs were wishing for food, and my son wished for Hamburgers, so we visited <a href="http://www.kauppayhtio.fi/en">Kauppayhtiö</a> where we both enjoyed tasty (vegetarian) Burgers 🍔. They claim to have the best Burgers in town, and we definitely were happy with ours. The whole place is nicely decorated too - if you like a sort of 50s/ 60s Punk-Rock-Galleria Vibe, that is!</p>

<p>On the way home to Koti we strolled through the centre of Rovaniemi, which was very nicely illuminated and also still had some Christmas decorations up - Santa Claus doesn’t life far from here, so I guess that natural =)</p>

<p>Back at the Hostel we checked out the Sauna and then went to play <a href="https://amzn.to/3ffbNr4">∞ Carcassone</a> at the common room. We love boardgames and if a Hostel/ Hotel/ Café has Boardgames available it’s just a question of time till someone suggests a game! After several games it was time to hit the hay, and finally we were able to lay down in these inviting and comfortable beds.</p>

<p>We slept great in our room, and woke up fresh the next morning - but with rumbling stomachs! Off to the breakfast we went, in the beautiful Café. It was pretty full - the Breakfast is also open to people who do not stay at the Hostel, and of these there were quite some. I guess that alone tells you it’s a good place, if locals come to eat Breakfast there!</p>

<p>The breakfast options for Vegans were a bit limited, but I got enough to eat nevertheless - and the coffee was very good, so that definitely was a big plus. After that we went to play some more Boardgames and chill at the common room, before we walked to the railway station to travel south and home to Vaasa.</p>

<p>While it might seem we didn’t do a lot in Rovaniemi, we feel we did exactly the right amount of things in Rollo - explore the town a bit, relax, eat good food, and make the trip South a lot less stressful. That’s what we wanted, and that’s exactly what we got! If you travel with public transportation (the on-the-ground-kind) to Lapland, we can recommend travelling in two days south. Getting to <a href="https://www.visitrovaniemi.fi">discover more of Rovaniemi</a> is always worth it - there’s so much to see here, and the <a href="http://hostelcafekoti.fi/">Hostel Café Koti</a> is a great place in the centre of town to stay. On our next trip North and South, we’ll make sure stop here again, that’s for sure - we love relaxed, slow travelling!</p>

<p>My son and me were in Lapland in February, by now already something of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/02/father-son-ski-trip.html">a little tradition</a> for us two. It’s a great way to bond, talk, have fun together and experience the beauty of our home country. I this case we went to <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/fi/">Saariselkä</a>, a small village in the North-East of Finland, which I have <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/10/mountainbiking-in-lapland.html">visited</a> <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/urho-kekkonen-national-park.html">numerous</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/-AYVkZf61UE">times</a> over the past years as it’s located very close to several National Parks, Wilderness areas and is simply a great starting point for outdoor adventures. While we were hiking and skiing in Saariselkä also this time, we went on three different <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/open-fell-biking/">Fatbike rides in Saariselkä and Kiilopää</a>. As our family are cycling enthusiasts - we still don’t own a car! - trying out Fatbikes was something that my son and me both looked forward too!</p>

<h2 id="fatbiking-in-kiilop-and-urho-kekkonen-nationalpark">Fatbiking in Kiilopää and Urho Kekkonen Nationalpark</h2>

<p>Our first trip was with Tuija from the <a href="http://openfellbiking.com/">MTB Project</a> and Raili from <a href="https://www.rolloutdoors.com/fi/kiilopaa/">Roll Outdoors</a>. These two women were fantastic guides and showed us the best and most scenic trails around Kiilopää, and they even organized some glorious weather for us as you can see in the photos ☀️❄️😎 My son and me took the Ski Bus from Saariselkä to Kiilopää, a short 20 minute ride which takes you through the beautiful landscape. We met Raili and Tuija at the Roll Outdoors HQ and picked up our Fatbikes: They have e-Fatbikes, Kids Fatbikes, and the Canyon Dude 8.0 Fatbike which we rode. After a short introduction to the bikes and the plan for the day we started to ride through the Gates of the Urho Kekkonen National Park, and headed along the border of the National Park towards the Kiilopää Snow Bike Park, a good area to get familiar with the bikes in easy terrain and to see what they are capable off. The trails were freshly groomed and it was great riding on these fine trails.</p>

<p>The trails are well marked, and you can get a map to see where you are allowed to ride. Not all trails are allowed for Fatbikes - as tempting as it is to ride on the hard, flat XC Skiing trails: These are off-limits! There are over 50 km of Fatbike Trails, either pure bike trails or then open to both hikers and cyclists. We did encounter on our rides just a handful of hikers, who were always very friendly and excited to see us. Just make sure to slow down or even get off when you pass people, and all can use these trails together happily! We had a short break at the bottom of the Snow Bike Park at a Laavu, and then cycled a different route back to Kiilopää, where we made a proper lunch break.</p>

<p>After good coffee and hot juice, tasty vegan food and chocolate bananas we rode the trail up to Ahonpäät. The views from the trail - we were there right at the Golden Hour, which always gets me a bit excited and I have the urge to just stop every 100 m and take photos 😆 - were breath-taking. Not just because of the long up-hill, but also because of the magnificent views.</p>

<p>The trees were absolutely beautiful, fully hiding beneath the snow, a warm, golden light was making everything look beautiful and all four of us were just smiling from ear to ear. A moment to remember.</p>

<p>After all the uphill it was time to turn the Fatbikes around and point our tires down and back to Kiilopää! Timo, the <a href="https://www.pallasyllasoutdoors.com">local trail builder</a>, has created a wonderfully flow-trail which gives you great views while you descent. You should <a href="https://youtu.be/WRvGZ18se0o">watch the video</a> to see what I mean, the photos simply don’t do it justice of how beautiful this trail is!</p>

<p>Happy, and a wee bit cold, we arrived back at the Roll Outdoors Shop in Kiilopää, and went inside of the <a href="https://www.kiilopaa.fi">Suomen Latu</a> building to have a hot chocolate. It was a fantastic day, and both my son and me look back fondly to it!</p>

<h2 id="fatbiking-around-saariselk-village">Fatbiking around Saariselkä village</h2>

<p>The next day we rented bikes from <a href="https://www.laplandsafaris.com/en/activities-in-lapland/cycling-and-winter-fat-biking">Lapland Safaris</a> in Saariselkä and went on a self-guided trip. As it was snowing and again pretty cold, we decided to ride to the Savottakahvila Café in Laanila, which was a good choice. It was at some point almost a wee Blizzard and it was hard to see far, so we both were happy when we reached the Café and could have a hot chocolate and a Laskiaispulla!</p>

<p>There was an old Prospector’s cottage close by, and as we both are interested in geology we tried to go there - sadly there’s no Fatbike trail going to it, and as we didn’t want to break the Rules we headed back on the same trail to Saariselkä. By now the weather also started to be a bit more sunny, so it was nice to ride the trails with a fresh cover of snow and in the sunshine ☀️❄ !</p>

<p>On our last day in Saariselkä we went Fatbiking with Guide Janne from Lapland Safaris. We got the same bikes as on the previous trip, which was great as they were all dialled in to our heights, and then we took off after Janne!</p>

<p>This time we went a bit off-the-beaten-track and road our Fatbikes towards the west on a Trail which I had hiked back in the autumn of 2019, before turning south and then east again towards Laanila. It was yet again a very snowy and cold day, and big snow flakes were coming down from the grey clouds. The trail was well-maintained but the snow kept growing on it, making for good riding.</p>

<p>In the middle of the forest we had a break, drunk some hot, tasty juice which gave us back some warmth, and ate a little snack, while playing with the new, soft snow around us, all while it continued to snow. So much beautiful snow! After this wee break we rode on, arriving at Laanila and then continuing on a familiar trail back to the village.</p>

<p>Fatbiking in Saariselkä and Kiilopää was a fantastic winter activity for us. My son got better at riding with each time we rode our Fatbikes, and he really enjoyed the flowy downhill sections of the trails (he didn’t care that much about uphills, but then: Few do 😁). While he didn’t fall he did at some points simply on purpose fell into the deep, soft snow which is surrounding the trail, which makes for a soft and safe landing. I was happy about the variety of trails available for us, and that many are easy enough for younger children - though I do hope more demanding and longer trails will get built in the next winter! Overall this was a great alternative to XC or downhill skiing, and allowed us to explore the nature at our own speed - faster than hiking, but slow enough to take in the details of the nature surrounding us. Right now in March and April, with the <em>hankikanto</em> (that time of the year where the top snow layer is carrying people and bikes without that you break through) it is also possible to ride almost everywhere, and especially on the open fells and lakes this makes for fun, good riding. But then you still have these awesome trails, which you really should ride!</p>

<h2 id="where-to-stay-what-to-eat-and-everything-else">Where to stay, what to eat and everything else</h2>

<p>We stayed in an Apartment at the <a href="https://www.laplandhotels.com/FI/lapin-hotellit/saariselka/lapland-hotels-riekonlinna.html">Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna Hotel</a> which has an ideal location: 5 minutes from the Store and even less time to be on a trail for skiing, Fatbiking or hiking. The <a href="https://skisaariselka.com/ski-bus/">Ski Bus</a> stops in front of the building, as are the buses to the south and north.</p>

<p>Our Apartment had all the amenities we could have wished for: A Sauna, comfortable beds, a well-equipped kitchen and a drying closet for drying all our sweaty and wet clothes!</p>

<p>We ate breakfast and dinner at the Hotel, and they served great Vegan food - I really appreciated that! In the afternoons, after we returned from our activities, we usually would sit down at the fire place in the lobby and have a hot chocolate. There are several other Restaurants and Take-Away options in the village, or then we also could have cooked in our apartment.</p>

<p>As usual we travelled by public transportation to Lapland, but if you are not alone then drive your car north - then you are mobile there. Taking the Bus from Rovaniemi to Saariselkä is a short and scenic 3 hour ride, and it really gets you in the mood for the outdoors as you ride past lakes and forests and every so often slow down to let the Reindeer get off the road. Taking an (overnight) train to Rovaniemi from Southern Finland is also very convenient, as you wake up well rested and just a short ride away from your next outdoor adventure. This is also a good way to travel if you want to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/outdoors-in-helsinki.html">explore Helsinki</a> before or after a visit in Lapland - or stop for some days in <a href="">Rovaniemi</a> while you are here. Finally, if you come from abroad you also can fly directly to Ivalo, from where you can take a bus or Taxi to Saariselkä.</p>

<p>In Saariselkä you have a great outdoor shop, several Cafés and Restaurants and a grocery store. Make sure to read the <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/2020/10/14/travel-safely/">Travel Safely</a> website, use a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/10/reuseable-face-masks.html">Reuseable Face Mask</a> and do all those things which you should do to minimize the risk of getting ill. Other than that - enjoy your holiday in Saariselkä, Lapland!</p>

<p>Travelling safely during the Covid-19 Pandemic is possible in Finland (with some caveats, more about these <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel/status/1361235118329913344">here</a>) and so my 9-year old son and me travelled to <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/en/">Saariselkä</a> - long-time readers will remember my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/10/mountainbiking-in-lapland.html">autumn</a> trip there. Saariselkä is a tranquil little village with 300 inhabitants and lays at the gates of the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/urho-kekkonen-national-park.html">Urho Kekkonen National Park</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqEBC4yj3Faikt3HHS3jU8l3Fm8pxQvN3">Hammastunturi Wilderness</a>. It has a superb network of Fatbike and XC Skiing trails, a small but very good Ski Resort and plenty of other opportunities of enjoying the outdoors. As well as many great accommodation options, like the wonderful <a href="https://www.laplandhotels.com/EN/hotels-in-lapland/saariselka/lapland-hotels-riekonlinna.html">Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna</a> where we stayed.</p>

<p>We were exceptionally lucky with the weather - it was ☀️ every day but bitterly cold, some days at low as a felt temperature of -32°C - but even those temps were bearable with the <a href="https://youtu.be/E_ma70A6HkM">right clothes</a> and keeping active!</p>
