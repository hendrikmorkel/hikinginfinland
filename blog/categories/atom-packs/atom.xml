<p><em><a href="https://palantepacks.com/">Pa‚Äôlante Packs</a> operates out of a garage in Arizona, and John Z as he is commonly known is one part of the company - the 2nd owner is Andrew Bentz. John Z has a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/johnzahorian">Youtube Channel</a> and has hiked a lot of long trails - no wonder he had some ideas how a good pack should be made! I am very happy that John took the time to answer my questions so that we can learn a bit more about Pa‚Äôlante Packs! Withour further ado - here‚Äôs the interview!</em></p>

<p><em>John, please briefly introduce yourself and tell us who you are. Since when are you backpacking, and how did you start?</em></p>

<p>I grew up in Ohio and didn‚Äôt really begin adventuring until I started bike touring just after high school. Over time I grew more interested in the unpaved roads away from a steady stream of cars. And then while riding across the country one year I did an overnight hike in Glacier NP and had an incredible experience. I found out about the Pacific Crest Trail a few months later and promptly quit my job to do that.</p>

<p><em>How often are you outdoors nowadays?</em></p>

<p>I am outdoors a lot. I live out of a compact car, constantly traveling and meeting up with hikers and hiking, in addition to nesting with my laptop in libraries all over. Additionally, every year I squeeze in a few months of longer trips.</p>

<p><em>Are you two more ‚Äúweekend warriors‚Äù or do you have some long distance trips under your belt?</em></p>

<p>We both have long distance trips under our belt. I have hiked the triple crown (PCT, CDT, AT), the Arizona Trail, Colorado Trail unsupported fastest known time, Great Divide Trail, various sections of off-trail routes, and another 1900 miles on the PCT.</p>

<p><em>Hiking in Finland Readers &amp; me, we are gear-nerds! What is your typical baseweight?</em></p>

<p>My baseweight tends to float around 6lbs for thru hiking. Going as high as 8 in colder conditions and as low as 2 or 3 for a pleasant overnight. Another major variable in my gear selection for each trip is balancing how much I intend to focus on some quiet time outdoors vs challenging myself with higher effort hiking vs making the best video possible.</p>

<p><em>Please tell us where the name ‚ÄúPa‚Äôlante Packs‚Äù came from, and what it stands for.</em></p>

<p>Pa‚Äôlante came from Andrew‚Äôs time living in Panama, where ‚Äúpara adelante‚Äù is popularly shortened to Pa‚Äôlante, meaning onward or to keep going. This reflects our style of hiking, where you go fast and light, continually moving through the landscape. And this style is reflected in our products, which are designed for people who hike in a similar style.</p>

<p><em>What makes Pa‚Äôlante Packs different from other cottages?</em></p>

<p>Every cottage company is different and has its own area of expertise. Ours is currently characterized by our fast and light hiking style. We also are a bit different than many companies starting out in that we don‚Äôt really do custom work. We spend a lot of time iterating during the design process and making a lot of very deliberate design decisions and putting miles in to really live and connect with the designs before we are ready to release them to others.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0PRTrLdscvM?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><em>Is Pa‚Äôlante Packs your full-time job or ‚Äújust a hobby‚Äù?</em></p>

<p>It‚Äôs a bit in between right now. We haven‚Äôt paid ourselves yet, but we are definitely very focused on the company. Andrew is graduating from college any day now and when he does he will be going full-time. I do the marketing/ brand /community side so my duties are a bit more abstract, but basically everything I do comes back around to ‚Äúwill this benefit Pa‚Äôlante?‚Äù.</p>

<p><em>Pa‚Äôlante Packs makes lightweight and stylish backpacks - two at the moment. Can you tell us how the idea to start the company emerged and how you see its future?</em></p>

<p>We both had similar goals, so it made sense to pair up. When we first got together to work on our initial pack designs, things really clicked. As far as the future goes, I‚Äôm not really much of a planner, just react to things as they come.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WNfoYXw-NxI?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><em>Any intentions of starting to branch out into other segments, for example offering shelters or bivys?</em></p>

<p>For sure! We have both been using our own shelter designs for a while now. But going from an MYOG project to a product for widespread use is a long road.</p>

<p><em>Are there any other cottage manufacturers in the USA that you work with?</em></p>

<p>The manufacturing company in Arizona that does our major production is a bit of a cottage manufacturer, being a small operation and the owner having a small cottage pack company as well. We also have really good relationships with Katabatic and Gossamer Gear. They have been really helpful and supportive to us as we‚Äôve started.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/uP02f6" title="workshop"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1819/43924698051_7c75cf1939_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="workshop" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>And are you in touch with other cottage manufacturers in Europe, Japan, Canada and other places?</em></p>

<p>We are not.</p>

<p><em>Your company is still young and already has been getting good reviews and praise from all over the backpacking community. Is business going well?</em></p>

<p>The business is going well! Our major problem seems to be trying to keep up with demand, as we often sell out of our production runs rather quickly. We have not gone in debt and do not plan to, so this has provided a natural cap so that we do not grow too quickly helps keep the related growing pains down while we develop the processes to continue growing in the future if that is the case.</p>

<p><em>Can you tell us a bit how you went about the design process of your new Joey backpack, and where the inspiration came from?</em></p>

<p>The Joey started with Andrew‚Äôs JMT FKT pack in 2014. He basically wanted a simple and lightweight running vest style pack. Then this past year the design process got kickstarted when Joe McConaughy and Joey Camps both went for the self supported AT FKT and used the packs that very closely resemble what the final Joey ended up being.</p>

<p><em>John, we love to be let in on the work-in-progress stuff! What kind of new products are you working on at the moment?</em></p>

<p>I‚Äôve been making some shelters I‚Äôm pretty excited about. Andrew‚Äôs been making some shorts. We‚Äôre in the early stages of a framed pack design. Fanny packs. I‚Äôve been using my own fleece sweater recently. I use my own wallet. It‚Äôs a bit all over the place and based on what we want and are excited about.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/482VR7" title="P1210712"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1839/43206574614_afa765dc59_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="P1210712" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>And are there any new lightweight materials that have you all excited?</em></p>

<p>There are so many possibilities with Dyneema Composite Fabrics. If there are very specific properties you desire out of a fabric you can dial in the layers to match those needs. And in addition to things like abrasion and tear and puncture strengths, you can also get heat weldable and adhesive bonding properties. Talking to Wes, the DSM applications manager, always gets me really excited.</p>

<p><em>How works the R&amp;D at Pa‚Äôlante Packs, do you have a need yourself that you try to fix, or do some of your clients inspire you for new products and ask you for solutions to their problems, which then are adopted in the Pa‚Äôlante Packs line-up?</em></p>

<p>The start of a product always comes from our own needs. For the Simple Pack and now the V2, it came from gaining back the accessibility you lose when wanting to be uninhibited by hipbelts and large attachable shoulder strap pockets. With the Joey, it started with Andrew wanting a pack that would work well for his JMT FKT.</p>

<p><em>Where do your customer come from, and how do they find you?</em></p>

<p>In the beginning a lot of our brand awareness came from Andrew‚Äôs and my social media and trips. Internet chatter at places like r/UL and FB groups plays a big role in people‚Äôs gear awareness and decisions. And then I think that the word of mouth on long trails plays a big role. Even before everyone had a smartphone, information spread around the well established trails surprisingly quickly, and now with the proliferation of apps like instagram, hikers are extremely well connected and there are a lot of eyes on them, following their journeys.</p>

<p><em>When and where was your last trip?</em></p>

<p>I just finished up a section hike on the Pacific Crest Trail in northern California this past week. I really love that trail and it‚Äôs always great to be out there on it, even though the weather was less favorable than I‚Äôve experienced during the normal thru-hiking season.</p>

<p><em>And where is your dream backpacking trip taking you?</em></p>

<p>I‚Äôve been looking at northern Canada with increasing frequency lately.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/4Th47z" title="jupiter mcafee knob"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1798/43206572214_afddc1f275_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="jupiter mcafee knob" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>Any favourite piece of gear which you always carry with you?</em></p>

<p>I take my Katabatic quilt with me on every trip. On an overnight that is often the only thing inside my pack other than food.</p>

<p><em>Are you planning to get out for a trip soon, and enjoy the spring in Utah and Arizona?</em></p>

<p>We‚Äôre going to be taking a little ‚Äúbusiness trip‚Äù on the Hayduke Trail together this autumn! Both of us have been wanting to do that trail for years, so it will be great to be out there and hike together again.</p>

<p><em>Social Media - on which channels is Pa‚Äôlante Packs active?</em></p>

<p>We are on <a href="http://instagram.com/palantepacks">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/palantepacks">Youtube</a>!</p>

<p><em>John, I thank you very mucho for taking the time to answer my questions =)</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the 3rd <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/announcing-the-cottages-interviews-2018.html">Cottages Interview</a> of 2018 we get to know Tom Gale of Atom Packs üá¨üáß</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.atompacks.co.uk">Atom Packs</a> I found when Alex Roddie tweeted about the company earlier this year, and like Alex I think the packs which Tom makes are really great looking with smart details. As I was making the list of companies to interview for this series Tom has one of the first ones I contacted, and I am very happy that he agreed to participate (he‚Äôs super-busy and hasn‚Äôt had a day off in four weeks, so order your pack AFTER you read this interview, OK ;). Without much further ado - here‚Äôs Tom‚Äôs Interview!</em></p>

<p><strong>Tom, please briefly introduce yourself and tell us who you are. Since when are you backpacking, and how did you start?</strong></p>

<p>Who am I? Whoa now, this could get deep. I guess I‚Äôm a hiker: It is at the core of nearly everything I do.</p>

<p>I started long distance hiking in 2009, setting off on the Appalachian Trail like so many others under a crippling load with as many things strapped to the outside of my bag as were inside. I think I also had maybe 8L of water with me. Urgh. That guy. The longer I hiked, the more content and quiet my busy brain became and I swiftly began to feel that this had to be something that I built my life around. I came home and began working towards becoming a professionally certified Outdoor Guide and, within a few years, was doing what I loved and sharing my passions with others every day.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/3w2A25" title="Tom Gale, Atom Packs"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1742/42680476092_9b0ecaf815_b.jpg" width="1024" height="846" alt="Tom Gale, Atom Packs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>How often are you outdoors nowadays?</strong></p>

<p>Hahaha, less so now than I would like. I tend to get out on my mountain bike for at least an hour a day. This business expanded much quicker than I‚Äôd anticipated but I try and find the time, normally I work until about 7pm and then get out for an hour, chasing the sunset through the trees on one of the mountains near my house. I‚Äôm pretty well situated for some incredible riding, even if I‚Äôm exhausted it always makes me feel better.</p>

<p><strong>Are you more of a ‚Äúweekend warrior‚Äù or do you have some long distance trips under your belt?</strong></p>

<p>I‚Äôm a huge fan of micro adventure. I try and get out most weekends but the reality is that currently I don‚Äôt get much time off - Hopefully soon things will come back under a little more control. I live surrounded by mountains and lakes and it‚Äôs very easy to just grab a pack and go, but I suppose my priorities are currently with growing my business.</p>

<p>I have hiked some 12,000 miles now on the big three trails in the US, the Te Araroa and another few thousand miles around the coast of England. I don‚Äôt plan on stopping any time soon, this business might try and stop me but, hey, I‚Äôm thirty years old and it‚Äôs about time I tried some of this so-called ‚Äúadulting‚Äù. I promised myself I‚Äôd give the business three years and see where I am at, only then will I decide if it was a dumb idea.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/623M9Q" title="Tom Gale, Atom Packs"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1737/42680476172_c33442b8d2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Tom Gale, Atom Packs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Hiking in Finland Readers &amp; me, we are gear-nerds! What is your typical baseweight?</strong></p>

<p>That‚Äôs a great question. I actually have no idea. Somewhere between 3 - 5 kg. I used to count every gram but after my third major hike I realised it didn‚Äôt actually make much difference to me - I‚Äôm a big guy, 6ft7 and 100 kg and I eat an absolutely OBSCENE amount of food, at least 2kg a day when on trail so my pack weight is always pretty heinous when leaving town. I also realised it was completely relative ‚Äì my 3.5kg base weight felt just at terrible the day I left town on the PCT in 2015 as it did leaving town on the AT in 2009 with a 9kg base weight. It doesn‚Äôt matter what your baseweight is ‚Äì your bag will ALWAYS feel like shit the day you leave town. Why worry about a couple of ounces here and there when you are about to hike out an entire rotisserie chicken, three avocados, a bunch of bananas, some beer and whole loaf of bread out of town‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs good training. I‚Äôm not belittling the gram counting approach ‚Äì for people who have some control over there caloric intake I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs very justified ‚Äì I will just always completely fill my bag with food regardless of how long it is to the next town so the base weight becomes a pretty small percentage of that.</p>

<p>There are a lot of hikers who can starve themselves on trail and come into town with zero calories i.e. without a morsel of food left in their bags. This is the elusive thru hiking ‚Äúgold star‚Äù but, the reality of achieving that largely gives me an anxiety attack, I think I‚Äôve only ever done it twice in 12,000 miles and I nearly fainted. It‚Äôs completely out of my control.</p>

<p>I do try to stay under 3.5kg but my process on a thru hike is always the same. I start heavier than I want to, then pare my gear down over the first couple of months, shedding everything I can, and then I realise I‚Äôm cold and uncomfortable and in as amazing hiking shape as I‚Äôll ever be and then start adding luxuries items again. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm at my most ultra light eight weeks into a hike.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/Kn5436" title="Tom Gale, Atom Packs"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1727/28856277618_9e24f89dab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Tom Gale, Atom Packs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Please tell us where the name ‚ÄúAtom Packs‚Äù came from, and what it stands for.</strong></p>

<p>I was trying to think of the smallest, lightest thing that I could. Initially the name was Atomic Ultralight but try typing that into Google and you‚Äôll quickly realise why I changed it, you just can‚Äôt compete with the entire spectrum of information on quantum physics. I was stuck on the name for ages and then one day the name <a href="https://www.atompacks.co.uk">Atom Packs</a> came to me. The fact it‚Äôs got my name in it as well is just a very happy accident ‚Äì A-Tom Packs. People give me credit for that. They shouldn‚Äôt.</p>

<p><strong>What makes Atom Packs different from other cottages?</strong></p>

<p>I make durable, lightweight gear (Dura-lite if you will!). I build the best packs that I can out of the best materials available to me. Sure, there may be lighter materials available, but that comes at a cost of either durability or comfort. The way I see it, there has to be some sense behind design: A backpack has the hardest job of any piece of gear that you carry, it is responsible for holding onto literally everything else that you take with you into the wilds and an extra few grams in its design can greatly increase both the durability of the pack and the carrying comfort of the user - In my view that is well worth the weight penalty. If you design a pack right, you won‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs heavier because the weight is working FOR you, not AGAINST you.</p>

<p>I think, in essence, most companies are all in this for the same reason: There isn‚Äôt the gear that we desire available to us, so we make our own. Every hiker on the planet has a different way of doing things, so I aim to create the gear that individual people want. Sure, some people will say that another brand/ fabric/ method is better, and they could well be right when it comes to their way of hiking, but I have designed my brand to be flexible to peoples needs so, I‚Äôd ask that person to shoot me an email and lets talk. It‚Äôs a great learning experience for me as well as people force me to step out of my comfort zone and design something new ‚Äì quite a few of these requests have actually become part of my daily designs.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/D1Ge7D" title="Tom Gale, Atom Packs"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1731/42680475722_25128f21b6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="890" alt="Tom Gale, Atom Packs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Is Atom Packs your full-time job or ‚Äújust a hobby‚Äù?</strong></p>

<p>It‚Äôs now full time! Argh! I have some token bits of guiding work over the summer but the reality is that I can‚Äôt really afford the time away from the business at present so, yep, I now sew for 70+ hours a week. It‚Äôs pretty intense.</p>

<p><strong>Atom Packs makes lightweight and stylish backpacks and backpack accessories. Can you tell us how the idea to start the company emerged and how you see its future?</strong></p>

<p>It mostly came from a need to create the gear that I wanted - I‚Äôm so tall that any off the shelf backpack/ daypack that I bought ended up with its hipbelt somewhere below my nipples. Combine this with a natural curiosity for the unknown and I found myself sitting at a sewing machine making quite a horrible mess. That is basically the process that is still ongoing today, if not a little more refined!</p>

<p>In the coming weeks I am moving into a proper workshop. Here I will expand my production to cope with demand and begin training up an employee or two. I know that this business cannot possibly expand any more than it currently is with me crouched over a sewing machine for 70+hours a week. The danger is that I eventually have some kind of sewing-induced break down and run bare-assed and screaming into the cold night, never to be seen again. A lot of cottage companies have gone the same way and I‚Äôm trying really hard to not make the same mistakes. I‚Äôm still slipping and sliding my way along the learning curve but my processes are getting more refined with each day.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/hendrikmorkel/71118j" title="Tom Gale, Atom Packs"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1727/28856276158_a294c57d60_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Tom Gale, Atom Packs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Any intentions of starting to branch out into other segments, for example offering shelters and bivys?</strong></p>

<p>Yes‚Ä¶ but lets not get ahead of ourselves.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any other cottage manufacturers in the United Kingdom that you work with?</strong></p>

<p>Not at present. Everyone I have spoken with has been very supportive though! I‚Äôd love to team up with a few brands in the future, that way we can all benefit.</p>

<p><strong>And are you in touch with other cottage manufacturers in Europe, Japan, Canada, the USA and other places?</strong></p>

<p>Other than a few messages/ comments via Instagram, not currently. There are some great companies making some great kit out there, Instagram gives you a nice peek into what they‚Äôre up to.</p>

<p><strong>Your company is a just several months old and already has been getting good reviews and praise from all across Europe. Is business going well?</strong></p>

<p>Haha, yes it blew up pretty quickly didn‚Äôt it!? I properly launched the website at the end of February and quickly got far more orders than I knew what to do with. I don‚Äôt advertise or spend money on promotion, I‚Äôm just trying to let it naturally grow by putting the product out there to be seen. Any product worth its salt will succeed, given the chance, I‚Äôm just very wary of outstripping my production capacity. I think that‚Äôs always the issue with cottage companies ‚Äì when you are one guy in a shed it is easy to get overwhelmed and something that started off as creative and fun becomes a great, snarling monster that consumes most of your life. It‚Äôs been quite a journey, that‚Äôs for sure.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit how you went about the design process of The Atom pack, and where the inspiration came from?</strong></p>

<p>I used to work with Adrian Moore at Aiguille Alpine Equipment and he used to say that ‚Äúif you take away everything else, a rucksack at its most basic is just a potato sack with straps‚Äù. <a href="https://www.atompacks.co.uk/product-page/the-atom">The Atom</a> came from stripping back everything that I knew about backpacks and starting from the ground up. I wanted people to be able to start with a tube and add whatever they wanted to it, The Atom as you see it is exactly the pack that I would want on a thru-hike, it just happens that that has become the standard design.</p>

<p>I have to give some credit to ‚ÄúDubstep‚Äù, my esteemed hiking companion of 5000 miles. I asked her to design her perfect backpack and she, not taking the process particularly seriously, designed a pack with rockets on the side pockets. That‚Äôs what inspired some of the Atom‚Äôs aesthetic, I was trying to make it look like a rocket.</p>

<p><strong>Tom, we love to be let in on the work-in-progress stuff! What kind of new products are you working on at the moment?</strong></p>

<p>Removable carbon frames. They‚Äôre the future!</p>

<p><strong>And any new lightweight materials that have you all excited?</strong></p>

<p>Liteskin by Dimension Polynant. I bought a bunch of it and have been experimenting with it a little. KS Ultralight have been using it but I‚Äôve not seen any long term reviews yet. It strikes me as a really solid fabric that, for its weight, is pretty incredible. I designed a 35L Atom with a padded hipbelt that came in at under 380g - that‚Äôs pretty special! The big test will be how well it holds up. I‚Äôve been working with Andrew Sherry (@thehikingstory on Instagram) ‚Äì I‚Äôm keen to send him one to try and break it just to see how well it holds up as there have been no real long term tests done yet and everyone, myself included, are a little twitchy.</p>

<p><strong>How works the R&amp;D at Atom Packs, do you have a need yourself that you try to fix, or do some of your clients inspire you for new products and ask you for solutions to their problems, which then are adopted in the Atom Packs line-up?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I think I sort of answered this before. I have already solved the problems that I have encountered, so when people come to you with new issues it can really help to develop the product forwards.</p>

<p><strong>And where do your customer come from, and how do they find you?</strong></p>

<p>I put something on Reddit in February and it sort of went a bit wild from there. I sell a lot of packs to Germany and Scandinavia, I‚Äôve also sent packs to New Zealand, USA, Canada and even Brazil. Basically anywhere. I‚Äôve been amazed at how the Internet has driven this business forward, it has been simultaneously humbling and terrifying ‚Äì the world is a very small place these days.</p>

<p><strong>When and where was your last trip?</strong></p>

<p>My last big hike was the Continental Divide Trail, I‚Äôve only just properly gotten over it mentally ü§£. Otherwise I try and get out on day hikes where I can. It‚Äôs good for the soul and a great excuse to test backpacks.</p>

<p><strong>And where is your dream trip taking you?</strong></p>

<p>The Te Araroa south island was about as happy as I have ever been. It was also the most amount of times I have ever nearly died in a period of time. I‚Äôd hike it again in a heartbeat! I‚Äôm aiming to go for the Arizona Trail this October but can not figure out if I can stop this runaway train I‚Äôm currently sitting on. I guess the dream trip is the next one you are undertaking or the one you are currently on. And there are so many trails! Argh!</p>

<p><strong>Any favourite piece of gear which you always carry with you?</strong></p>

<p>I picked up an <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/msr-blizzard-tent-stakes-tent-stakes/?pid=10239">MSR Blizzard Stake</a> on the CDT and quickly fell in love. They cost $5, weigh 1 oz and I use it for both camping and digging cat holes (because everybody poops). Not only do you feel like you can dig forever but I also put a bit of duct tape on the inside edge and would use it as a water spout to get water out of slow trickling springs, it was amazingly effective!</p>

<p><strong>Are you planning to get out for a trip soon, and enjoy the summer in the United Kingdom?</strong></p>

<p>I would like to start a continuous walk around the Wainrwrights, these are 214 fells situated in the Lake District National Park. I doubt I‚Äôd be able to do it in one go but I can dream! Otherwise I am determined to hike the AZT in October. There are a load of 200 mile hikes in my vicinity. It‚Äôs just having the time!</p>

<p><strong>Social Media - on which channels is Atom Packs active?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/atom_packs/">@atom_packs on Instagram</a>. I need to get Facebook and Twitter set up properly so watch this space. It‚Äôs very distracting though.</p>

<p><strong>Tom, I thank you very mucho for taking the time to answer my questions =) Is there something you would like to add?</strong></p>

<p>I guess I‚Äôd like to encourage those who are seeking out their first UL setup go with their gut and not just the status quo. It takes many hundreds, if not thousands, of miles to truly understand what you need and don‚Äôt need. Just because you want a pack with a padded hipbelt does not mean you are no longer qualified to call yourself ultralight, no matter what they say on the forums.</p>

<p>Instead of obsessing over gear lists or whatever everyone else is doing, just throw some stuff in a bag and go hiking. If it works for you, keep it, if it‚Äôs cheap, even better. There are many thousands of ways to spend many thousands of dollars on gear. The best way to know what works is to go and actually do it yourself and then slowly, piece by piece, replace items for lighter alternatives. Once you understand an items use and, more importantly how you interact with it, then you can make a truly informed decision. Otherwise the danger is buying every piece of gear three or four times before you get it right ‚Äì and that doesn‚Äôt leave you much money for hamburgers and beer. Thanks for your time, see you down the trail ‚ò∫</p>
