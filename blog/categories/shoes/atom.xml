<p>I own more shoes than my wife. I blame the multitude of activities I partake in for the amount of shoes in my closet, as well as my desire to try out new technologies. In this article are all but one pair of shoes which I have used in the last 16 months - the notable absence are the <a href="https://bit.ly/2BFopb7">‚àû Luna Sandals OSO Flaco</a> which are my much-loved summer sandals, which I will review at a later point. Many of the shoes in this article are made for specific activities but I tend to use all shoes at a minimum for hiking and some every-day use. Anyway, let‚Äôs jump in!</p>

<h2 id="la-sportiva-trango-ice-cube-gtx">La Sportiva Trango Ice Cube GTX</h2>

<p><strong>Weight</strong>: One Boot 697 g, Pair 1397 g // <strong>Size</strong>: 42 // <strong>Buy them</strong> at <a href="https://bit.ly/2PxQF61">‚àû La Sportiva</a>, <a href="https://tidd.ly/3sByUl4">‚àû Bergzeit</a> (currently 12% off), <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/la-sportiva-trango-ice-cube-gtx-mountaineering-boots/?pid=10239">‚àû Bergfreunde</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/3u3LCJz">‚àû Backcountry</a> or find the best deals on <a href="https://www.outdoordeals.com">Outdoordeals.com</a>!</p>

<p>The La Sportiva Trango Ice Cube GTX are my ice climbing boots (which means they are fully crampon compatible!) - but as I climb less ice nowadays (simply less time) I have used these boots for the most part as winter hiking boots. For many years I have tried to get away in winter with using trailrunning shoes, but as soon as some snow is involved low shoes fill up with snow, which equals wet socks, which means cold feet. I am not fond of cold &amp; wet feet, and hence the La Sportiva Trango Ice Cube GTX come since two years on every time I go into the snow in winter - these are mid-high boots with a super nice integrated gaiter, which closes around my leg and hence there‚Äôs no snow coming inside the boot or socks!</p>

<p>Another problem of trailrunning shoes is that I mostly use unlined shoes, and that means the wind goes through - and again cold feet are the result. The Trango Ice Cube GTX have an upper which is made in a seamless construction method and have an Gore-Tex Insulated Comfort lining that keeps my feet toasty and warm, even at <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/03/fatbiking-in-saariselka.html">-25¬∞C in Lapland</a>. I have used these boots for hiking, cycling, skiing with OAC Skinbased skis and also ice-climbing and mountaineering, as well as pottering around in the snow. I like that they are relatively lightweight, the high gaiter is ideal for my kind of activities and keeps the snow out, and they are toasty warm when moving around in the cold. If you need a warm pair of winter boots which you also can take climbing in the mountains, then I can strongly recommend the La Sportiva Trango Ice Cube GTX!</p>

<h2 id="on-cloudventure-peak">ON Cloudventure Peak</h2>

<p><strong>Weight</strong>: One Shoe 254 g, Pair 506 g // <strong>Size</strong>: 42 // <strong>Buy them</strong> at <a href="https://bit.ly/3fp72wC">‚àû ON Running</a>, <a href="https://tidd.ly/3fn2rLn">‚àû Bergzeit</a>, <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/on-cloudventure-peak-trail-running-shoes-bf/?pid=10239">‚àû Bergfreunde</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/3u5Pzxw">‚àû Backcountry</a> or find the best deals on <a href="https://www.outdoordeals.com">Outdoordeals.com</a>!</p>

<p>I have been trailrunning in these shoes for over two years now (switching around with other shoes!) and really like them. They have a wide-ish toe box, a good fit in the heel cup, a very thin tongue which make these shoes almost feel like a sock and the sole gives great grip on all sorts of surfaces: Mud, granite rocks and trails full of roots. On asphalt sections and hard gravel roads they weren‚Äôt perfect - the ‚ÄúClouds‚Äù as these open sections of the sole are called do have good cushioning on trails, but on roads I find them less good - and as they are not made for road running, I only use them on the short sections to get to the trail. But yeah, the sock-like fit, together with the thin, breathable upper, make this a great shoe for running in the summer. The laces are really good, too - a tad long, but they stayed closed, even on long runs. And the sole has good grip and cushioning as mentioned already. But do the Zero-Gravity heel Clouds provide softer landings, as they claim? I can not agree nor disagree with it to be honest. Does that make them less good? Hell no! I‚Äôm always happy to go running in these shoes - and they fit well in with my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning outfit</a>, too!</p>

<p>I received these in January 2020 and they have become my Every-day use shoes after the snow is gone and before it gets really warm (as then I prefer to wear Sandals). Besides walking to the Kindergarden and along the coast I also use them for easy day hikes, cycling and scrambling =) These are Black Diamond‚Äôs first entry into the Footwear market, and after using them for over a year I think they have done a good job. The sock-like fit is great: It‚Äôs easy to slip into the shoes for example, and if you have them on there‚Äôs nothing rubbing you the wrong way, so they are really comfortable. The upper is made from one piece and claimed to be very breathable, which is true to a certain temperature - at temperatures over 20¬∞C I do get sweaty feet in them. The rubber sole is really excellent on rock and it‚Äôs nice to scramble up the big rocks which the last Ice Age left here in Vaasa - precise placements are no problem. The sole is also surprisingly durable for all the asphalt walking I have done in them over the past year, which is very positive. Overall a really lightweight and grippy shoe, which I use with pleasure - I hope to test them in the mountains soon, approaching some climbs!</p>

<p>I bought these shoes last year and used them on my backpacking &amp; packrafting trip in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/lemmenjoki-national-park.html">Lemmenjoki National Park</a>, and was a bit disappointed that the toe cap came lose after just 60 km of hiking. Also the Graphene rubber sole, which is claimed to be more durable, has not lived up to the hype in my opinion - but then maybe I hiked too much over very hard granite rocks for long stretches, which is a very taxing underground on all soles - especially if I consider that these Mudclaw shoes are made for muddy and wet trails. In those conditions they have been very good, giving great grip with their deep lugs in the mud, and no chance of slipping. I love the close feel to the ground in these shoes, and they have been comfortable even on 40 km days across the wilderness of Lapland. The overall durability is a bit of a let-down though, as I expected more from the Graphene soles - maybe I have to pick up the <a href="https://tidd.ly/39nPT2K">‚àû Roclite G 275</a> and see if it is lasting longer on hard rock surfaces. For the time being, I‚Äôll continue to go running and hiking in these Mudclaw G 260 though.</p>

<h2 id="salomon-s-lab-speedcross">Salomon S-Lab Speedcross</h2>

<p>After years of not using any <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/salomon-speedcross-3.html">Salomon Speecross Shoes</a> I got these S-Lab Speedcross shoes three years ago - and damn, are they good! As <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">I wrote in 2018</a>: These S-Lab shoes are light, have great grip, are comfortable and have ‚Äúno ankle support‚Äù. But after running in them for 2+ years I can report I haven‚Äôt had any problems running in them and the lack of ‚Äúankle support‚Äù is not an issue for me. I still don‚Äôt like that the pocket for the laces is designed badly (newer Salomon shoes do that much better!), but other than that these are great Speedcross shoes which convince with great grip, fit and comfort also on long runs. I expect these will continue to be good for a year or two, as I pretty much only use them for running or the occasional hike so the durability of the sole has been very good.</p>

<p>I bought these in February 2020 as I am fed-up with the super slippery roads we have in winter in Vaasa, and after I fell on my buttocks a few times over the past years I decided enough is enough. These are trailrunning shoes with spikes, and have no lining - which also makes them somewhat ‚Äúcold‚Äù in really cold weather. But the main reason these shoes are brilliant are the 16 studs which ensure bomb-proof grip on even the smoothest of ice! That grip is absolutely fantastic and I haven‚Äôt felt insecure on icey roads even once this winter! The bluesign upper is smooth, pretty durable and also water repellent but not waterproof - I have gotten moist feet when using them in deeper snow, so I try to stay clear of that. The sock-like fit is very comfortable and also on runs these have performed very good, ensuring I can continue to run in even the most slippery conditions. Overall a great shoe that ensures I stay upright even on mirror-like ice roads and trails!</p>

<h2 id="tecnica-plasma-s">Tecnica Plasma S</h2>

<p><strong>Weight</strong>: One Shoe 423 g, Pair 884 g // <strong>Size</strong>: 42 // <strong>Get a pair</strong> at <a href="https://www.blizzard-tecnica.com/us/en/men/hiking/shoes/plasma-s">Tecnica</a> or find the best deals on <a href="https://www.outdoordeals.com">Outdoordeals.com</a>!</p>

<p>These shoes I got as a Test sample on the last #OutDoorFN fair in Friedrichshafen, and have used them on-and-off over the past three years. The footbed and upper are fully customized to my feet for a personalized and unique fit, as much like a ski boot these shoes can be moulded to your feet. And yes, these are comfortable shoes, which I have used hiking, cycling and walking around in town. The Vibram Megagrip sole is great on wet and dry trails alike, but the black mesh upper does tend to get dirty and it‚Äôs not that easy to clean. The shoe is also pretty warm and nothing I can use in the summer, but for right now and these wet, cold and ice-free seasons I find them really good. However, it‚Äôs also a ‚Äúheavy‚Äù shoe and it stands quite high above the ground - something I had to get used to, as I prefer to use shoes with a low or Zero Drop which allow me to be close to the ground. But even if they aren‚Äôt the shoes I‚Äôd use on long hikes, I do think that these are good shoes, especially for people who want a perfect fit, great grip and don‚Äôt mind the higher weight.</p>

<p>And that are all the shoes I used in the last 16+ months - quite a wide selection, and several shoes actually have been used for even longer, but as I continue to get plenty of DMs and question on Social Media about my shoes I though it is about time to answer all these questions in one go! By the way, I also used the previously reviewed <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/la-sportiva-crossover-2-dot-0-gtx.html">La Sportiva Crossover 2.0</a> on several hikes in the past year - but then they started to smell after the last hike so badly I had to dispose them! So, <strong>which of these shoes have peaked your interest?</strong> Let me know on <a href="https://instagram.com/hendrikmorkel/">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a>!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On recent trips I haven‚Äôt worn trailrunning shoes. That‚Äôs because I switched to the La Sportiva TX2, an ultralight approach shoe which I found great for backpacking, scrambling &amp; Via Ferratas. Read my review to see if you should switch to them too &amp; how they fare in the snow.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>La Sportiva provided me last year with the TX2 for free to take them to the Dolomites. Additionally, since the beginning of 2017 I‚Äôm sponsored by La Sportiva.

Read the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/about/">Transparency Disclaimer</a> for more information on affiliate links &amp; blogger transparency.</em></p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I received the TX2 last year in late September, just in time for my backing trip to the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/autumn-backpacking-in-the-dolomites.html">Dolomites</a>. I have used them on several hiking and climbing trips since, and they‚Äôre also my city shoes of choice at the moment. All in all I have hiked, approached mountains, cycled and walked around town several hundred kilometres in them.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30317861721/in/album-72157675269849996/" title="La Sportiva TX2"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8550/30317861721_e7048769ff_z.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="La Sportiva TX2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The TX2 is the lightest approach shoe La Sportiva makes. It‚Äôs main purpose is to take you into the mountains to the start of your climb, where they can be banded together and you can clip them to your harness while you climb your objective, so that at the summit you can slip back into them and walk back down (or rappel, which is more comfortable than rappelling in climbing shoes). I have found them also great for Via Ferratas and backpacking, as they‚Äôre very grippy and allow me to scramble securely.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30287286992/in/album-72157675269849996/" title="Camp on the fourth morning"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5680/30287286992_aeb90feb6a_z.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Camp on the fourth morning" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The TX2 packs these features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>One piece (seamless) polyester knit upper for amazing breathability, drainage, and comfort</em></li>
  <li><em>Extremely lightweight and packable for harness attachment or throwing in a pack with the C2‚Ñ¢ ComboCord around the heel</em></li>
  <li><em>√úber-sticky Vibram¬Æ Mega-Grip‚Ñ¢ rubber outsole</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>I haven‚Äôt seen something like the C2‚Ñ¢ ComboCord around the heel of the shoe, which allows you to wrap them together and clip them to your harness. It‚Äôs what has drawn me to the TX2 initially and is a cool little feature for climbers, but backpackers probably won‚Äôt make much use of it - unless you carry a second pair of shoes (maybe some <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a>?!) in which case you might find it useful to pack them small together.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>As I wrote above, I have used this show for almost a year in autumn, winter, spring and summer on the limestone of the Dolomites, Finnish granite, snow &amp; asphalt and wooden trails and have never found anything wrong with them. They‚Äôre always comfortable for my feet with a good fit in the heel, and the toe box is wide enough to accommodate my toes.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm wearing a Size 42 TX2 and in that size it weighs 283 g per shoe, or 566 g for the pair.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36480485685/in/dateposted/" title="La Sportiva TX2 on nice trails"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4419/36480485685_ee8c356e8d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="La Sportiva TX2 on nice trails" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>Since 2003 La Sportiva has been using the ISO 14.001 Environmental Management System (in conjunction with the ISO 9.001 Quality Standard, like any smart company!). In 2010 they made investments to make the production and working environment better, and in 2016 Lorenzo Delladio, the president and CEO of La Sportiva, was awarded the honour of ‚ÄúKnight of the National Order of Merit‚Äù for conducting the family business with an eco-sustainable approach that is aware of the company‚Äôs social responsibilities towards the environment. That‚Äôs about all the infos I found on their <a href="http://www.lasportiva.com/en/company">website</a>, as well as that there‚Äôs some Vegan shoes and garments available from La Sportiva, but sadly there‚Äôs no further information on how you should recycle your shoes or apparel when they‚Äôre worn out.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>As always, this is the most important part of the whole article - get a cup of coffee and then read on.</p>

<p>As I asked La Sportiva if they‚Äôd like to send me a pair of TX2 for taking them to the Dolomites it was a nice surprise that a week later they were with me and I could test them already a bit on my local trails before flying south to the Alps. The TX2 is light - really light for an approach shoe, which can easily weigh double as much as these. That lightness also means they‚Äôre very breathable - which is great in warm weather (but I still got warm feet in the jungles of Mexico) - but can get a bit fresh if you happen into snow on your hike. Nevertheless, with some good Merino socks that was also not a problem, and I was happy to descend a steep and snowy mountain in them. The upper dries pretty fast, after descending a snowy pass and continuing the hike it was about an hour later that shoes and socks were dry again. The shoe has a wee toe bumper which means impacts from the front or kicking steps into soft-ish ice and snow are nor problem, but it‚Äôs very short. The thinly padded tongue is stitched to the upper from the middle down which keeps it centred and is an elegant solution the tongue hanging out to one side or the other.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35645210724/in/photostream/" title="Ran that snowy pass down in the La Sportiva TX2 &#x3D;)"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4370/35645210724_0395622014_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ran that snowy pass down in the La Sportiva TX2 &#x3D;)" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I like the Vibram Mega-Grip Traverse-Lite sole of the shoes, these do have an exceptional great grip on wet rocks of all kind. The lugs aren‚Äôt very deep (common design in approach shoes) so wet, grassy slopes and very muddy trails need to be navigated carefully, but with the right technique that‚Äôs not a problem either. The climbing zone at the front allows you to scramble &amp; climb easier grades (this postulates that you have the skills), and that‚Äôs also what makes these shoes pretty good for Via Ferratas. The sole is pretty soft which I like too - stiff shoes are not good for me unless the activity really demands it (ice climbing). These shoes edge well, which means small foot holds - think a one centimetre or less - are for me easy to place my feet on and stick it. I routinely go ‚Äúbouldering‚Äù with these shoes when I‚Äôm out with the kids, and they are great for that.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35644614054/in/dateposted/" title="La Sportiva TX2 Climbing Zone on the Sole"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4352/35644614054_dac7b33974_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="La Sportiva TX2 Climbing Zone on the Sole" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36426180041/in/dateposted/" title="Flexible"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4395/36426180041_849276611d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Flexible" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Which brings us to the fit. I can move and splay my toes in the shoe in my normal hiking lacing up, but if you‚Äôre serious about the scrambling and climbing you can lace the shoe up very tightly for a better feel. It‚Äôs a pretty low volume so very thick socks are not recommended. The construction, in conjunction with the lacing makes the shoe wrap around my foot like a comfortable glove. I can jam my foot into a crack when climbing and know the shoe and my foot will stay put. The heel again is very good for my foot, even if laced loosely it has a secure fit and the microfleece-like lining is soft &amp; comfortable. The shoe has a 4 mm Ortholite Approach which I find a good match, I generally don‚Äôt like shoes with much drop and these are right there where I like it.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I could say that they could be lighter, but I fear that make them less durable, so all in all there really isn‚Äôt anything that I can think of that could make them better.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>I have used quite a few pairs of approach shoes, and while some where good - like the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/05/arcteryx-acrux2-fl-gtx.html">Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX</a> - <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/salewa-wildfire-approach-shoes.html">others</a> I didn‚Äôt like that much. <a href="http://www.lasportiva.com/en/approach-footwear">La Sportiva</a> themselves also offer a variety of approach shoes, and the TX2 is just the start.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/36516686256/in/dateposted/" title="Hi there deeeeeeeep cave!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4340/36516686256_a75c73fbd0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hi there deeeeeeeep cave!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>Overall I really like the La Sportiva TX2 and that‚Äôs not just because La Sportiva sponsors me. It‚Äôs a lightweight shoe which works for me in many different situations, from every day cycling and walking to backpacking and Via Ferratas in the mountains. I keep them laced up and just slip in and just lace them tighter when it gets more vertical. Despite the lightweight construction the shoe has held up very well thus far and almost daily use for 6 to 8 months hasn‚Äôt make them look worse - I believe I‚Äôll be using these still next year in the autumn! Which brings me back to the question from the start: Should you switch from trailrunning shoes to these? If you use trailrunning shoes only for hiking &amp; backpacking and not for actual trailrunning then I think you should give these definitely a try. At 566 g a pair in Size 42 they are as light as many trailrunning shoes and share many of the properties which you like from them: Breathability, grip and flexibility. They add packability and the climbing sole means you can navigate scrambles on your hikes more securely, which for mountain treks is a useful benefit. I‚Äôm very happy with my switch and don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôll move back for the foreseeable future.</p>

    <updated>2015-06-23T23:00:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com//2015/06/arcteryx-acrux-ar-alpine-boot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the 2015 <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/06/arcteryx-alpine-academy-chamonix-2015.html">Arc‚Äôteryx Alpine Academy</a> I got a sneak peek at the new Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux AR Alpine Boot, the first alpine climbing boot from Arc‚Äôteryx. I was lucky enough to try it on and play around with it in Chamonix, and also take a look at the two new Approach and Crag shoes, the Acrux SL and Arakys.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19052626366" title="The 2016 Arc&#x27;teryx Footwear News - Outsides by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/444/19052626366_d607d066f4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="521" alt="The 2016 Arc&#x27;teryx Footwear News - Outsides" /></a></p>

<h2 id="acrux-ar-alpine-boot">Acrux AR Alpine Boot</h2>

<p>The goal of Arc‚Äôteryx with the Acrux AR was to create a light, durable, weatherproof and well fitting double boot. The boot we saw and tried on at the Arc‚Äôteryx Academy arrived just that morning and so was an early pre-production model, but it should be relatively close to the boot that will be standing in the stores in 2016. I will share my impressions on the Arc‚Äôteryx boot and compare them to my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/scarpa-rebel-ultra-gtx.html">Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/scarpa-phantom-ultra-boots.html">Scarpa Phantom Ultra Boots</a>, both boots that I think are damn near perfect.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18458184033" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot in its natural Habitat by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3695/18458184033_16a7489781_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot in its natural Habitat" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18427468573" title="I &lt;3 my Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX Boots by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/290/18427468573_44079149bf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="I &lt;3 my Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX Boots" /></a></p>

<h2 id="the-lightness-of-being">The Lightness of Being</h2>

<p>My Rebel Ultra GTX are 773 g per boot in Size 42,5 or 1.546 g for the pair, and the Phantom Ultra Boots are 918 g per shoe in Size 42,5 or 1.845 g for the pair. Keep in mind that these both are single boots! The Acrux AR GTX is a double boot - it has a removable liner - and one boot will weigh 940 g or 1.880 g for the pair in UK Size 8.5. So it is better to compare it to something like the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/scarpa-phantom-6000-schuhe-orange-38/">Scarpa Phantom Ultra 6000</a> (2.000 g per pair in Size 42) and the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/la-sportiva-spantik-schuhe-grey-yellow-grey-yellow-38/">La Sportiva Spantik</a> (2.400 g per pair in Size 42). These are quite a bit more heavy than the Acrux AR GTX, and I am not aware of a lighter alpine double boot (there are lighter skiing boots available).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18891197418" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/370/18891197418_1fe5583699_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot" /></a></p>

<h2 id="durable--weatherproof-construction">Durable &amp; Weatherproof Construction</h2>

<p>The boot is made to last - how long that is depends on how often you‚Äôre out in the mountains. If that‚Äôs just once a year for two weeks these probably will last you several years, while if you‚Äôre a Mountain Guide they only might last a season or two. The boot made a very sturdy impression on me, with the weakest link probably being the T-Zip Zipper which makes the gaiter waterproof. Maybe a quick look at the construction is in order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inside you find a <strong>Removable Gore-Tex Liner Booty</strong> which also packs some insulation and so keeps your feet warm</li>
  <li>The Boot has on the inside a <strong>PE Inner Shell</strong> construction which does not absorb moisture and has a lacing system for a secure and good fit</li>
  <li>On the outside we have a <strong>Laminated Waterproof Gaiter</strong> which closes with the T-Zip zipper for complete protection from snow, water and the cold</li>
  <li>Around the bottom of the boot there‚Äôs a <strong>Laminated Watertight Construction</strong> which has a 0,6 mm thick TPU film for high abrasion and puncture resistance</li>
  <li>The <strong>Midsole</strong> is very elaborate and made from six pieces which are custom made for this boot, in every size! It‚Äôs made up of a Carbon Fibre frame, an EVA Midsole and is protected by a wrapped TPU moulded heel and toe cap</li>
  <li>And underneath this all is a <strong>Vibram Mountaineering Outsole</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This all creates a durable boot which will be great for your alpine adventures and ice climbing alike. Oh, and a really cool is that the shoe can be re-soled, despite the elaborate sole construction.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19082087401" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/435/19082087401_7f2ebc7519_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot" /></a></p>

<p>The goal of the Acrux AR GTX Boot was to make a double liner boot that low in volume - more akin to the Scarpa Phantom Ultra - while bing warmer than the Rebel Ultra GTX. The boot we saw certainly achieved that goal, and was not much bigger than the Rebel Ultra GTX in volume, and lower in volume than the Phantom Ultras I have. I find low volume boots not just aesthetically better, but they also more practical in use in my opinion: I can climb better in a low volume boot, find easier foot holds in tight spots and it‚Äôs easier to get your pants over them, too.</p>

<h2 id="impressions--conclusions">Impressions &amp; Conclusions</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm used to very light footwear - <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a> I love for hiking and every day use, and on the trail I often sport a pair of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/inov-8-trailroc-235.html">trailrunners</a> - so boots always will feel heavy to me. I tried the Acrux AR GTX Boot on and walked a bit around in them - not really a test thus - and they certainly felt heavy to me, especially since I also had my Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX boots along for my clinics. But they weren‚Äôt uncomfortably heavy and of course it is better to evaluate them when using them in cold weather in the mountains and not in front of a Restaurant, where they will probably not feel heavy anymore, but I‚Äôd likely appreciate their warmth at -5¬∞C at 3.800 m altitude.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18458171633" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3832/18458171633_4aa257f560_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot" /></a></p>

<p>The boot was comfortable on my foot, the inside lacing enabled a secure fit with a Velcro Strap which held it in place. The Gaiter is adjusted via a Drawstring in the back and the gaiter is easy to open and close with the T-Zip zipper. The liner was warm and comfortable, and the adaptive fit will mould the liner over time to your foot for a personal fit. The seamless construction of the liner should minimize blisters and pressure points if that‚Äôs something you have problems with in other boots, and because it can be removed you can dry it faster or use it as a hut/ camp bootie.</p>

<p>The <strong>Conclusion</strong> is that the Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot certainly is a boot waiting for if you‚Äôre often out on Multi-Day adventures in the mountains. At 600‚Ç¨ it is competitively priced, the low volume and being a double boot sets it apart from the competition and it is very well made. I hope to be able to put them through their paces in the future and share a detailed review on them after a lot of use.</p>

<h2 id="acrux-sl--arakys-shoes">Acrux SL &amp; Arakys Shoes</h2>

<p>Besides the Acrux AR Alpine Boot Arc‚Äôteryx will also launch a <strong>S</strong>uper<strong>L</strong>ight version of the Acrux, which will tip the scales at 300 g per shoe. It has no Gote-Tex lining (Yay!), a Vibram Megagrip sole and is made for demanding approaches and descents. The Acrux SL comes in a Men‚Äôs and Women‚Äôs Version in four colours each. I think this will be a great crag/ every day outdoor shoe that will be popular, I certaily would pick a pair up.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19082127781" title="Acrux SL Women&#x27;s Above by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/308/19082127781_e5d1fcf646_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Acrux SL Women&#x27;s Above" /></a></p>

<p>And the other new shoe is the Arakys. Arc‚Äôteryx promotes it as a ‚Äú<em>ultralight bouldering and single pitch approach shoe designed for indoor and outdoor climbers</em>‚Äù. The closure system can be operated with one hand and is easy to switch from climbing (closed) to belaying (open). The heel is collapsible and turns it into a slipper. It will weigh about 270 g per shoe in UK Size 8.5, has a Vibram MegaGrip sole and comes also in a Men‚Äôs and Women‚Äôs Version with four colours per sex. I probably wouldn‚Äôt use it for climbing &amp; bouldering, but for approaches, at the crag and scrambles it probably would be very nice.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Acrux¬≤ FL GTX from <a href="http://arcteryx.com/">Arc‚Äôteryx</a> is the Canadian brand‚Äôs entry into the approach footwear business. Made of an hydrophobic outside and a Gore-Tex slipper with a Vibram MegaGrip sole, it is a unique shoe. How it performed in the outdoors, you can read here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17203304149" title="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX - Side and Sole by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7794/17203304149_daccb18e5a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX - Side and Sole" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>The Acrux¬≤ FL GTX arrived in late March and has been along on the International Appalachian Trail in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/ireland/">Ireland</a>, where I wore it for seven days straight in rain and sunshine. I usually review gear only after a long period of time - often a year or longer - but as there‚Äôs a lot of interest in this shoe I wrote this initial review. I will update it after more use in the future.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16767071834" title="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX at the coast by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8700/16767071834_2caf372641_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX at the coast" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX is two shoes in one: A Gore-Tex liner (blue) and a Hydrophobic shell shoe (black). For simplicity‚Äôs sake I will refer to them as the liner and shell. As an approach shoe it‚Äôs function is to allow you to get easily to the crag and back and for that it has a grippy sole with a climbing zone in the toe area which allows you to do easy scrambles in them. The shell does not absorb water and the liner has a Gore-Tex lining, which makes it highly water-resistant.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Arc‚Äôteryx separated the shell and lining of a traditional shoe and made two separate ones out of it, while re-designing both. So the upper is made from a single-piece of fabric, with a TPU-coating on the non-perforated parts which make them abrasion-resistant and let them shed water easily. The shell is also not sewn, but all parts are laminated together for a seam-free feel, which minimizes the risk of blisters and chaffing.</p>

<p>While there might have been shoes like these before, Arc‚Äôteryx is the first brand in recent time that brings a shoe with a removable liner to market. What‚Äôs very special is that the liners of the Acrux¬≤ and the Bora¬≤ are interchangable - which means you can use the high, insulated liner of the Bora in your Acrux, or if you need more water-protection in the Acrux use the high Gore-Tex bootie liner - They all work together. The liner is also thought to increase the airflow inside the shoe, which should maximize ventilation. It‚Äôs made from stretchable materials which hug your feet for a comfortable feeling, all day long.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17363563336" title="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX 0.1 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7789/17363563336_c26f9bc77a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX 0.1" /></a></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The quality of these shoes - both liner and shell - is superb as you expect from Arc‚Äôteryx. The whole construction is very tidy and clean, with no little threads hanging around. The laminated upper is super smooth and stylish, while the liner bootie has minimal seams and is very comfortable.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX is a medium-weight shoe, in EU Size 42 they weigh:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Liner: 126 g</li>
  <li>Shoe: 371 g</li>
  <li>Total: 499 g</li>
  <li><strong>PAIR 998 g</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17389527005" title="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX - 0.5 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8710/17389527005_3de2af25d0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX - 0.5" /></a></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>The Acrux¬≤ FL GTX is a stylish shoe. If you travel a lot to go climbing &amp; hiking and also will spend some time in civilization, airplanes, hotels and B&amp;Bs the Acrux FL¬≤ GTX are great beacause while they are functional approach shoes they also could pass as a stylish city sneaker. I used them as a scramble and approach shoe as I was <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/sea-stack-climbing-in-ireland.html">sea stack climbing</a> and there they worked fantastic. The Vibram MegaGrip sole had superb traction on the wet slabs at the coast, and the small climbing zones at the toes allowed for good foot placements on small ledges.</p>

<p>Also for hiking the shoes were very comfortable, even in hot weather (more on that underneath). I was a bit worried before flying to Ireland if the shoe would be too hot and might give me blisters, but the truth was that even on long, high kilometer days the shoes were comfortable and I finished the trip without blisters, even on those close to 20¬∞C sunshine &amp; blue-bird days. The laces were very good and did not come undone, something which has been a problem with some other shoes. The shoe is comfortable all day long, the liner hugs my foot nicely and you can lace up the shell as loose or tight as you like. At 499 g per shoe they‚Äôre medium weight but I didn‚Äôt get tired feet in the shoes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17203380689" title="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7681/17203380689_b77edb80bc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX" /></a></p>

<p>Now one of the design ideas of this shoes was that you can take the Gore-Tex liner out if it gets wet and can dry it overnight in your sleeping bag or tent. In practice I am not sure if it works, to get the liners dry again I needed to place them close to a radiator so that they would be dry the next morning; if there was no heat source then they were still moist the next morning. It could be that if you take the moist liners into your sleeping bag at a bivy that they will dry out well, but in my limited tests I am not sure if it works. An alternative could be to carry a 2nd pair of liner booties - at 126 g they‚Äôre not too heavy - and so ensure always dry feet. What I missed in this respect was that the shell did not have some drainage/ ventilation holes at the sole-level, this would help to get water out faster when you wade through a stream (or bog!).</p>

<p>What the liners are really great for is being used as a camp shoe. I used them to stroll around and the grippy rubber sole and light weight made them excellent for that. I also can imagine them to work very well for <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/packrafting/">packrafting</a>, where you can use them as your bootie in the packraft and the complete shoe for hiking. I jumped from rock to rock over the Atlantic with them on my sea stack adventure and they gave good grip on the wet &amp; salty rocks at the Irish coast, which means for me that they should be good as a paddling booty.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17182072687" title="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX - 1.0 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7786/17182072687_852f3232fb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX - 1.0" /></a></p>

<p>Fit-wise I found the liner and shell to be both spacious. The EU Size 42 shoe gave me plenty of space inside the liner bootie to move my toes around, and when laced tighly they gave me good control and feel on small ledges. The heel did feel a bit wider and could for me be more narrow, but with a sock that‚Äôs well-cushioned in the heel you will have a good feel and should be fine. Overall a good &amp; spacious fit for my normal feet with plenty of space for movement.</p>

<p>I have a couple of gripes thus far with the shoe: The black shell makes the shoe very hot. Even on the mild (+11¬∞C) spring days we have currently here in Vaasa the shoe is getting very hot, very quickly. I wore <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/bridgedale-coolmax-liner-socke-doppelpack-black-black-36-39/?pid=81">Coolmax socks</a> which usually are good in warm weather, but in this shoe I got hot feet very quickly. I am not sure if another colour would mitigate this, or if the shell would just need more &amp; larger ventilation openings in the shell shoe so the ventilation is improved.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17203302519" title="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX - 2.0 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8702/17203302519_31521ebe12_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX - 2.0" /></a></p>

<p>The second thing I do not recommend: Walk through a bog with them. Along the IAT in Ireland I crossed several swamps, and the combination of bog flora &amp; fauna + my own sweat created an unbearable smell in the shoes. It was absolutely terrible and I felt slightly afraid to go sit with them in a plane for several hours. At home I first tried the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/grangers-universal-spray-cleaner-275ml/">Granger‚Äôs Universal Spray Cleaner</a> but that showed no success in terms of getting rid of the smell (probably should have used the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/grangers-odour-eliminator-60ml/?pid=81">Granger‚Äôs Odour Eliminator</a>), so they went into the washing machine with <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/nikwax-tech-wash-pflegemittel-002/?pid=81">Nikwax Tech Wash</a> which got rid of the smell for the most part. So I would not recommend them for walking in swamps right now, unless there‚Äôs a good way to get rid of the smell. If you‚Äôre in alpine environments where there‚Äôs no bogs this will not be of concern, but in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, England and Scandinavia you‚Äôre likely to encounter swamps in the hills, so keep this in mind (It might be of course that your sweat germs in combination with a bog‚Äôs flora &amp; fauna creates an irresistible odour and it‚Äôs just my sweat that‚Äôs wrong!).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17182071337" title="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7728/17182071337_162901961c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX" /></a></p>

<p>Finally, I hope Arc‚Äôteryx will release at the coming <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2014/">OutDoor</a> an membrane-free bootie liner. It really is missing for me in their bootie line-up, and I think it would make the shoe even more attractive for those of us who don‚Äôt need a Gore-Tex or Insulated bootie. Make it highly breathable with good drainage, with a material that‚Äôs odour-neutral, and it could be a winner.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17387539812" title="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX - Shell Inside by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7721/17387539812_572df856b7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc‚Äôteryx Acrux¬≤ FL GTX - Shell Inside" /></a></p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>I am not aware right now if there‚Äôs similar shoes that are made of a liner + shell, but I have no doubts that there could be. For ultralight backpackers and weight-conscious alpinists a combination of a unlined approach shoe + a <a href="http://bit.ly/1F5m1op">Gore-Tex sock</a> or <a href="http://bit.ly/1F5lXVO">Neoprene Sock</a> could also create this combination of a quick-drying shoe and a waterproof liner that you can dry easily over night.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>The Acrux¬≤ FL GTX is a shoe that brings fresh wind into the approach shoe market. A comfortable, removable liner paired with a hydrophobic, stylish shell and a grippy Vibram MegaGrip sole make this a great shoe for approaches, Via Ferratas and scrambles. The price of 250‚Ç¨ puts it at the high-end, but then you get essentially two shoes for the price of one. Add in the versatilty the Acrux¬≤ offers with the interchangable, removable liners and you have a great shoe for your mountain adventures, and you can get rid of a stinky liner bootie if you have hiked through a bog! Finally, as this is the first Generation of Arc‚Äôteryx footwear we can be curious to see what they will come up with the next Generations!</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I received the Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX over a year ago in November 2013. I climbed ice in Korouoma, Vaasa and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2014.html">Abisko</a> with them and was mountaineering in <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Chamonix</a> and the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/mountaineering-and-climbing-in-the-polish-tatras.html">Polish Tatras</a>. All in all they have seen over four weeks of use and have been used for ice climbing, mountaineering and hiking.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>Similar to the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/scarpa-phantom-ultra-boots.html">Scarpa Rebel Ultra</a> the Rebel Ultra GTX is made for technical mountaineering, rock climbing and speed climbing on ice &amp; mixed terrain with snow. It can be used with a wide variety of crampons.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Again Ueli Steck has helped to develop this boot, and you can see it from the weight and the technical features. While the sock-gaiter-construction isn‚Äôt new I have not seen a lot of mountaineering boots which use it. The Y-Structure, KCN-Tech fabric and Re-Active AC XT sole stand out on this booth, as does the very good fit &amp; the light weight.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The shoe is hand made in Italy and is from a quality point of view absolutely superb. The fit is impeccable and even after four weeks of hard use the boots still look like new. Only the reflective tape in the back of the shoe shoes some wear, otherwise boot and sole still look like new.</p>

<p>The boots are hand made in Italy. If you have worn it out you could have it resoled at your local shoemaker or you can recycle it via your local recycling scheme.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p><strong>Ice &amp; Mixed climbing</strong> I did with the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/grivel-g20-crampons.html">Grivel G20 crampons</a> to the boot and it‚Äôs a fantastic combination. The G20 are 424 g per crampon which means one shoe &amp; boot are 1197 g, which is about 150 g lighter than with the Phantom Ultra boots on. This might seem trivial but feels like a big difference. What I enjoy most with the Rebel Ultra GTX is, however, the freedom of movement my feet have in them. I can pretty much fully move my feet like I could in a trailrunner, with the difference that I can connect a pair of crampons to them and climb ice with them. This is especially useful for mixed climbing, but also on more tricky ice climbs in narrow places this freedom of movement helps in better foot placements. The high sock works like a gaiter &amp; keeps water and snow out and the carbon insert makes the sole nicely rigid for climbing. In short, the climbing in them is great, I really loved the freedom of movement they gave me.</p>

<p>The last winter was super mild and I wasn‚Äôt able to test the boots in severe cold weather, but the -5¬∞C I used them in, often while standing around on snow and ice, where no problem for them and I had warm feet and toes in the boots. When constantly moving one might be able to wear them in even colder temperatures, say to -10¬∞C, but beyond that I reckon they will be not warm enough and it‚Äôs better to put a warmer boot on. One option that I haven‚Äôt tried is using an overboot with them in colder weather for a little bit of extra insulation, though I almost think that just using a warmer boot would be lighter - though less versatile.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15864534166" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX in Chamonix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7496/15864534166_7c1da26c08_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX in Chamonix" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Hiking</strong> in these boots is possible but really wasn‚Äôt something I liked. While they allow great freedom of movement they are lined boots, so walking from the Chalet to the Cable Car in Chamonix, a 15 minutes walk, was not enjoyable as it was +35¬∞C in the valley, which meant I had super-sweaty feet by the time I arrived at the house. In the Tatras I hiked on two occasions with the Rebel Ultra GTX boots, once in warm weather which again was not good, and once in the pouring rain, where they were fine. I had moist feet &amp; boots after hiking four hours in the rain in them, but they were warm so it was OK. They did also dry almost completely over night. However, when I know I need to hike long distances in the summer I would always take my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals OSO</a> along for it, as I much prefer to hike in warm weather in them.</p>

<p><strong>Mountaineering</strong> in the Alps and Tatras I did most of the time with the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/grivel-air-tech-new-matic-steigeisen/?pid=81">Grivel Air Tech New-Matic</a> (453 g per crampon) but I also tried the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/camp-xlc-390-steigeisen/">CAMP XLC 390</a> (254 g incl. optional Antibot). The weight difference between these two crampons is almost 200 g so not trivial. I did climb more with the Grivel Air Tech New-Matics and do like them a lot, and these two crampons show that you can use the Rebel Ultra with either a plastic harness or a front bale. The light weight and freedom of movement of the boot of course are great for alpine climbs and the sole is sticky on rock and allows for precise foot placements. I still would switch to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/06/scarpa-stix.html">climbing shoes</a> for more demanding/ technical climbs, but if it are easy routes you‚Äôre doing the Rebel Ultra GTX are more than capable. Add in good grip on snow &amp; ice and you have a very efficient mountaineering boot.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>The <a href="">Scarpa Phantom Ultra</a> is a warmer and heavier boot which might attract the same people who‚Äôre curious about the Rebel Ultra GTX. If we look at other brands the <a href="http://bit.ly/1xAiXwT">La Sportiva Trango Cube GTX</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/1AhNGww">La Sportiva Batura 2.0 GTX</a> are both lightweight mountaineering boots which can be used for the same activities as the Rebel Ultra GTX.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm hard-pressed to come up with something that could be better in this boot. I am sure Scarpa and Ueli had their reasons to use Gore-Tex¬Æ instead of OutDry¬Æ for this shoe, personally I feel OutDry¬Æ is slightly better at keeping moisture out, dries faster and breathes better, but I think the Gore-Tex¬Æ lining does a good job in this boot. So really nothing to complain.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>The Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX is a beautiful <em>and</em> ultralight mountaineering boot that is excellent for early and late season ice &amp; mixed climbing and summer mountaineering. It keeps your feet &amp; toes warm till at least -5¬∞C even if you‚Äôre just standing around in the snow or hang in the belay, and with the Vibram¬Æ sole it is also well suited for easy alpine climbs. I think if you look to up your ice, mixed and alpine climbing by shedding weight and going lighter the Rebel Ultra GTX is the right boot for you. I love my pair and am always happy to put them on, because I know a good day in the outdoors lies ahead of me with them on my feet.</p>
