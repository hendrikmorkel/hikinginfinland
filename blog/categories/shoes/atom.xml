    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the 2015 <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/06/arcteryx-alpine-academy-chamonix-2015.html">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a> I got a sneak peek at the new Arc’teryx Acrux AR Alpine Boot, the first alpine climbing boot from Arc’teryx. I was lucky enough to try it on and play around with it in Chamonix, and also take a look at the two new Approach and Crag shoes, the Acrux SL and Arakys.</p>

<h2 id="acrux-ar-alpine-boot">Acrux AR Alpine Boot</h2>

<p>The goal of Arc’teryx with the Acrux AR was to create a light, durable, weatherproof and well fitting double boot. The boot we saw and tried on at the Arc’teryx Academy arrived just that morning and so was an early pre-production model, but it should be relatively close to the boot that will be standing in the stores in 2016. I will share my impressions on the Arc’teryx boot and compare them to my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/scarpa-rebel-ultra-gtx.html">Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/scarpa-phantom-ultra-boots.html">Scarpa Phantom Ultra Boots</a>, both boots that I think are damn near perfect.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18458184033" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot in its natural Habitat by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3695/18458184033_16a7489781_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot in its natural Habitat" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18427468573" title="I &lt;3 my Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX Boots by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/290/18427468573_44079149bf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="I &lt;3 my Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX Boots" /></a></p>

<h2 id="the-lightness-of-being">The Lightness of Being</h2>

<p>My Rebel Ultra GTX are 773 g per boot in Size 42,5 or 1.546 g for the pair, and the Phantom Ultra Boots are 918 g per shoe in Size 42,5 or 1.845 g for the pair. Keep in mind that these both are single boots! The Acrux AR GTX is a double boot - it has a removable liner - and one boot will weigh 940 g or 1.880 g for the pair in UK Size 8.5. So it is better to compare it to something like the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/scarpa-phantom-6000-schuhe-orange-38/">Scarpa Phantom Ultra 6000</a> (2.000 g per pair in Size 42) and the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/la-sportiva-spantik-schuhe-grey-yellow-grey-yellow-38/">La Sportiva Spantik</a> (2.400 g per pair in Size 42). These are quite a bit more heavy than the Acrux AR GTX, and I am not aware of a lighter alpine double boot (there are lighter skiing boots available).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18891197418" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/370/18891197418_1fe5583699_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot" /></a></p>

<h2 id="durable--weatherproof-construction">Durable &amp; Weatherproof Construction</h2>

<p>The boot is made to last - how long that is depends on how often you’re out in the mountains. If that’s just once a year for two weeks these probably will last you several years, while if you’re a Mountain Guide they only might last a season or two. The boot made a very sturdy impression on me, with the weakest link probably being the T-Zip Zipper which makes the gaiter waterproof. Maybe a quick look at the construction is in order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inside you find a <strong>Removable Gore-Tex Liner Booty</strong> which also packs some insulation and so keeps your feet warm</li>
  <li>The Boot has on the inside a <strong>PE Inner Shell</strong> construction which does not absorb moisture and has a lacing system for a secure and good fit</li>
  <li>On the outside we have a <strong>Laminated Waterproof Gaiter</strong> which closes with the T-Zip zipper for complete protection from snow, water and the cold</li>
  <li>Around the bottom of the boot there’s a <strong>Laminated Watertight Construction</strong> which has a 0,6 mm thick TPU film for high abrasion and puncture resistance</li>
  <li>The <strong>Midsole</strong> is very elaborate and made from six pieces which are custom made for this boot, in every size! It’s made up of a Carbon Fibre frame, an EVA Midsole and is protected by a wrapped TPU moulded heel and toe cap</li>
  <li>And underneath this all is a <strong>Vibram Mountaineering Outsole</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18458178933" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot Sole Parts by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/420/18458178933_c6fb463767_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot Sole Parts" /></a></p>

<p>This all creates a durable boot which will be great for your alpine adventures and ice climbing alike. Oh, and a really cool is that the shoe can be re-soled, despite the elaborate sole construction.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19082087401" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/435/19082087401_7f2ebc7519_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot" /></a></p>

<p>The goal of the Acrux AR GTX Boot was to make a double liner boot that low in volume - more akin to the Scarpa Phantom Ultra - while bing warmer than the Rebel Ultra GTX. The boot we saw certainly achieved that goal, and was not much bigger than the Rebel Ultra GTX in volume, and lower in volume than the Phantom Ultras I have. I find low volume boots not just aesthetically better, but they also more practical in use in my opinion: I can climb better in a low volume boot, find easier foot holds in tight spots and it’s easier to get your pants over them, too.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18458165843" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/528/18458165843_aa936d77db_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot" /></a></p>

<h2 id="impressions--conclusions">Impressions &amp; Conclusions</h2>

<p>I’m used to very light footwear - <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a> I love for hiking and every day use, and on the trail I often sport a pair of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/inov-8-trailroc-235.html">trailrunners</a> - so boots always will feel heavy to me. I tried the Acrux AR GTX Boot on and walked a bit around in them - not really a test thus - and they certainly felt heavy to me, especially since I also had my Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX boots along for my clinics. But they weren’t uncomfortably heavy and of course it is better to evaluate them when using them in cold weather in the mountains and not in front of a Restaurant, where they will probably not feel heavy anymore, but I’d likely appreciate their warmth at -5°C at 3.800 m altitude.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18458171633" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3832/18458171633_4aa257f560_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot" /></a></p>

<p>The boot was comfortable on my foot, the inside lacing enabled a secure fit with a Velcro Strap which held it in place. The Gaiter is adjusted via a Drawstring in the back and the gaiter is easy to open and close with the T-Zip zipper. The liner was warm and comfortable, and the adaptive fit will mould the liner over time to your foot for a personal fit. The seamless construction of the liner should minimize blisters and pressure points if that’s something you have problems with in other boots, and because it can be removed you can dry it faster or use it as a hut/ camp bootie.</p>

<p>The <strong>Conclusion</strong> is that the Arc’teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot certainly is a boot waiting for if you’re often out on Multi-Day adventures in the mountains. At 600€ it is competitively priced, the low volume and being a double boot sets it apart from the competition and it is very well made. I hope to be able to put them through their paces in the future and share a detailed review on them after a lot of use.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18891192148" title="Acrux SL Men&#x27;s &amp; Women&#x27;s + Arakys Men&#x27;s by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/377/18891192148_e57cbdc64a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Acrux SL Men&#x27;s &amp; Women&#x27;s + Arakys Men&#x27;s" /></a></p>

<h2 id="acrux-sl--arakys-shoes">Acrux SL &amp; Arakys Shoes</h2>

<p>Besides the Acrux AR Alpine Boot Arc’teryx will also launch a <strong>S</strong>uper<strong>L</strong>ight version of the Acrux, which will tip the scales at 300 g per shoe. It has no Gote-Tex lining (Yay!), a Vibram Megagrip sole and is made for demanding approaches and descents. The Acrux SL comes in a Men’s and Women’s Version in four colours each. I think this will be a great crag/ every day outdoor shoe that will be popular, I certaily would pick a pair up.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19082127781" title="Acrux SL Women&#x27;s Above by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/308/19082127781_e5d1fcf646_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Acrux SL Women&#x27;s Above" /></a></p>

<p>And the other new shoe is the Arakys. Arc’teryx promotes it as a “<em>ultralight bouldering and single pitch approach shoe designed for indoor and outdoor climbers</em>”. The closure system can be operated with one hand and is easy to switch from climbing (closed) to belaying (open). The heel is collapsible and turns it into a slipper. It will weigh about 270 g per shoe in UK Size 8.5, has a Vibram MegaGrip sole and comes also in a Men’s and Women’s Version with four colours per sex. I probably wouldn’t use it for climbing &amp; bouldering, but for approaches, at the crag and scrambles it probably would be very nice.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19082093501" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Arakys Men&#x27;s Side by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/319/19082093501_3cc742e332_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Arakys Men&#x27;s Side" /></a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Acrux² FL GTX from <a href="http://arcteryx.com/">Arc’teryx</a> is the Canadian brand’s entry into the approach footwear business. Made of an hydrophobic outside and a Gore-Tex slipper with a Vibram MegaGrip sole, it is a unique shoe. How it performed in the outdoors, you can read here.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>The Acrux² FL GTX arrived in late March and has been along on the International Appalachian Trail in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/ireland/">Ireland</a>, where I wore it for seven days straight in rain and sunshine. I usually review gear only after a long period of time - often a year or longer - but as there’s a lot of interest in this shoe I wrote this initial review. I will update it after more use in the future.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16767071834" title="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX at the coast by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8700/16767071834_2caf372641_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX at the coast" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX is two shoes in one: A Gore-Tex liner (blue) and a Hydrophobic shell shoe (black). For simplicity’s sake I will refer to them as the liner and shell. As an approach shoe it’s function is to allow you to get easily to the crag and back and for that it has a grippy sole with a climbing zone in the toe area which allows you to do easy scrambles in them. The shell does not absorb water and the liner has a Gore-Tex lining, which makes it highly water-resistant.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Arc’teryx separated the shell and lining of a traditional shoe and made two separate ones out of it, while re-designing both. So the upper is made from a single-piece of fabric, with a TPU-coating on the non-perforated parts which make them abrasion-resistant and let them shed water easily. The shell is also not sewn, but all parts are laminated together for a seam-free feel, which minimizes the risk of blisters and chaffing.</p>

<p>While there might have been shoes like these before, Arc’teryx is the first brand in recent time that brings a shoe with a removable liner to market. What’s very special is that the liners of the Acrux² and the Bora² are interchangable - which means you can use the high, insulated liner of the Bora in your Acrux, or if you need more water-protection in the Acrux use the high Gore-Tex bootie liner - They all work together. The liner is also thought to increase the airflow inside the shoe, which should maximize ventilation. It’s made from stretchable materials which hug your feet for a comfortable feeling, all day long.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17363563336" title="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX 0.1 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7789/17363563336_c26f9bc77a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX 0.1" /></a></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The quality of these shoes - both liner and shell - is superb as you expect from Arc’teryx. The whole construction is very tidy and clean, with no little threads hanging around. The laminated upper is super smooth and stylish, while the liner bootie has minimal seams and is very comfortable.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17203302069" title="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX - Shell, insole and liner bootie by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7762/17203302069_35755460e2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX - Shell, insole and liner bootie" /></a></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX is a medium-weight shoe, in EU Size 42 they weigh:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Liner: 126 g</li>
  <li>Shoe: 371 g</li>
  <li>Total: 499 g</li>
  <li><strong>PAIR 998 g</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17389527005" title="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX - 0.5 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8710/17389527005_3de2af25d0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX - 0.5" /></a></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>The Acrux² FL GTX is a stylish shoe. If you travel a lot to go climbing &amp; hiking and also will spend some time in civilization, airplanes, hotels and B&amp;Bs the Acrux FL² GTX are great beacause while they are functional approach shoes they also could pass as a stylish city sneaker. I used them as a scramble and approach shoe as I was <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/sea-stack-climbing-in-ireland.html">sea stack climbing</a> and there they worked fantastic. The Vibram MegaGrip sole had superb traction on the wet slabs at the coast, and the small climbing zones at the toes allowed for good foot placements on small ledges.</p>

<p>Also for hiking the shoes were very comfortable, even in hot weather (more on that underneath). I was a bit worried before flying to Ireland if the shoe would be too hot and might give me blisters, but the truth was that even on long, high kilometer days the shoes were comfortable and I finished the trip without blisters, even on those close to 20°C sunshine &amp; blue-bird days. The laces were very good and did not come undone, something which has been a problem with some other shoes. The shoe is comfortable all day long, the liner hugs my foot nicely and you can lace up the shell as loose or tight as you like. At 499 g per shoe they’re medium weight but I didn’t get tired feet in the shoes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17203380689" title="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7681/17203380689_b77edb80bc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX" /></a></p>

<p>Now one of the design ideas of this shoes was that you can take the Gore-Tex liner out if it gets wet and can dry it overnight in your sleeping bag or tent. In practice I am not sure if it works, to get the liners dry again I needed to place them close to a radiator so that they would be dry the next morning; if there was no heat source then they were still moist the next morning. It could be that if you take the moist liners into your sleeping bag at a bivy that they will dry out well, but in my limited tests I am not sure if it works. An alternative could be to carry a 2nd pair of liner booties - at 126 g they’re not too heavy - and so ensure always dry feet. What I missed in this respect was that the shell did not have some drainage/ ventilation holes at the sole-level, this would help to get water out faster when you wade through a stream (or bog!).</p>

<p>What the liners are really great for is being used as a camp shoe. I used them to stroll around and the grippy rubber sole and light weight made them excellent for that. I also can imagine them to work very well for <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/packrafting/">packrafting</a>, where you can use them as your bootie in the packraft and the complete shoe for hiking. I jumped from rock to rock over the Atlantic with them on my sea stack adventure and they gave good grip on the wet &amp; salty rocks at the Irish coast, which means for me that they should be good as a paddling booty.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17182072687" title="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX - 1.0 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7786/17182072687_852f3232fb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX - 1.0" /></a></p>

<p>Fit-wise I found the liner and shell to be both spacious. The EU Size 42 shoe gave me plenty of space inside the liner bootie to move my toes around, and when laced tighly they gave me good control and feel on small ledges. The heel did feel a bit wider and could for me be more narrow, but with a sock that’s well-cushioned in the heel you will have a good feel and should be fine. Overall a good &amp; spacious fit for my normal feet with plenty of space for movement.</p>

<p>I have a couple of gripes thus far with the shoe: The black shell makes the shoe very hot. Even on the mild (+11°C) spring days we have currently here in Vaasa the shoe is getting very hot, very quickly. I wore <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/bridgedale-coolmax-liner-socke-doppelpack-black-black-36-39/?pid=81">Coolmax socks</a> which usually are good in warm weather, but in this shoe I got hot feet very quickly. I am not sure if another colour would mitigate this, or if the shell would just need more &amp; larger ventilation openings in the shell shoe so the ventilation is improved.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17203302519" title="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX - 2.0 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8702/17203302519_31521ebe12_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX - 2.0" /></a></p>

<p>The second thing I do not recommend: Walk through a bog with them. Along the IAT in Ireland I crossed several swamps, and the combination of bog flora &amp; fauna + my own sweat created an unbearable smell in the shoes. It was absolutely terrible and I felt slightly afraid to go sit with them in a plane for several hours. At home I first tried the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/grangers-universal-spray-cleaner-275ml/">Granger’s Universal Spray Cleaner</a> but that showed no success in terms of getting rid of the smell (probably should have used the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/grangers-odour-eliminator-60ml/?pid=81">Granger’s Odour Eliminator</a>), so they went into the washing machine with <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/nikwax-tech-wash-pflegemittel-002/?pid=81">Nikwax Tech Wash</a> which got rid of the smell for the most part. So I would not recommend them for walking in swamps right now, unless there’s a good way to get rid of the smell. If you’re in alpine environments where there’s no bogs this will not be of concern, but in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, England and Scandinavia you’re likely to encounter swamps in the hills, so keep this in mind (It might be of course that your sweat germs in combination with a bog’s flora &amp; fauna creates an irresistible odour and it’s just my sweat that’s wrong!).</p>

<p>Finally, I hope Arc’teryx will release at the coming <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2014/">OutDoor</a> an membrane-free bootie liner. It really is missing for me in their bootie line-up, and I think it would make the shoe even more attractive for those of us who don’t need a Gore-Tex or Insulated bootie. Make it highly breathable with good drainage, with a material that’s odour-neutral, and it could be a winner.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>I am not aware right now if there’s similar shoes that are made of a liner + shell, but I have no doubts that there could be. For ultralight backpackers and weight-conscious alpinists a combination of a unlined approach shoe + a <a href="http://bit.ly/1F5m1op">Gore-Tex sock</a> or <a href="http://bit.ly/1F5lXVO">Neoprene Sock</a> could also create this combination of a quick-drying shoe and a waterproof liner that you can dry easily over night.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>The Acrux² FL GTX is a shoe that brings fresh wind into the approach shoe market. A comfortable, removable liner paired with a hydrophobic, stylish shell and a grippy Vibram MegaGrip sole make this a great shoe for approaches, Via Ferratas and scrambles. The price of 250€ puts it at the high-end, but then you get essentially two shoes for the price of one. Add in the versatilty the Acrux² offers with the interchangable, removable liners and you have a great shoe for your mountain adventures, and you can get rid of a stinky liner bootie if you have hiked through a bog! Finally, as this is the first Generation of Arc’teryx footwear we can be curious to see what they will come up with the next Generations!</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I received the Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX over a year ago in November 2013. I climbed ice in Korouoma, Vaasa and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2014.html">Abisko</a> with them and was mountaineering in <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Chamonix</a> and the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/mountaineering-and-climbing-in-the-polish-tatras.html">Polish Tatras</a>. All in all they have seen over four weeks of use and have been used for ice climbing, mountaineering and hiking.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>Similar to the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/scarpa-phantom-ultra-boots.html">Scarpa Rebel Ultra</a> the Rebel Ultra GTX is made for technical mountaineering, rock climbing and speed climbing on ice &amp; mixed terrain with snow. It can be used with a wide variety of crampons.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Again Ueli Steck has helped to develop this boot, and you can see it from the weight and the technical features. While the sock-gaiter-construction isn’t new I have not seen a lot of mountaineering boots which use it. The Y-Structure, KCN-Tech fabric and Re-Active AC XT sole stand out on this booth, as does the very good fit &amp; the light weight.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15889704852" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7473/15889704852_aecafa05ca_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX" /></a></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The shoe is hand made in Italy and is from a quality point of view absolutely superb. The fit is impeccable and even after four weeks of hard use the boots still look like new. Only the reflective tape in the back of the shoe shoes some wear, otherwise boot and sole still look like new.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>773 g per boot in Size 42,5 or 1.546 g for the pair.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p><strong>Ice &amp; Mixed climbing</strong> I did with the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/grivel-g20-crampons.html">Grivel G20 crampons</a> to the boot and it’s a fantastic combination. The G20 are 424 g per crampon which means one shoe &amp; boot are 1197 g, which is about 150 g lighter than with the Phantom Ultra boots on. This might seem trivial but feels like a big difference. What I enjoy most with the Rebel Ultra GTX is, however, the freedom of movement my feet have in them. I can pretty much fully move my feet like I could in a trailrunner, with the difference that I can connect a pair of crampons to them and climb ice with them. This is especially useful for mixed climbing, but also on more tricky ice climbs in narrow places this freedom of movement helps in better foot placements. The high sock works like a gaiter &amp; keeps water and snow out and the carbon insert makes the sole nicely rigid for climbing. In short, the climbing in them is great, I really loved the freedom of movement they gave me.</p>

<p>The last winter was super mild and I wasn’t able to test the boots in severe cold weather, but the -5°C I used them in, often while standing around on snow and ice, where no problem for them and I had warm feet and toes in the boots. When constantly moving one might be able to wear them in even colder temperatures, say to -10°C, but beyond that I reckon they will be not warm enough and it’s better to put a warmer boot on. One option that I haven’t tried is using an overboot with them in colder weather for a little bit of extra insulation, though I almost think that just using a warmer boot would be lighter - though less versatile.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15864534166" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX in Chamonix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7496/15864534166_7c1da26c08_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX in Chamonix" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Hiking</strong> in these boots is possible but really wasn’t something I liked. While they allow great freedom of movement they are lined boots, so walking from the Chalet to the Cable Car in Chamonix, a 15 minutes walk, was not enjoyable as it was +35°C in the valley, which meant I had super-sweaty feet by the time I arrived at the house. In the Tatras I hiked on two occasions with the Rebel Ultra GTX boots, once in warm weather which again was not good, and once in the pouring rain, where they were fine. I had moist feet &amp; boots after hiking four hours in the rain in them, but they were warm so it was OK. They did also dry almost completely over night. However, when I know I need to hike long distances in the summer I would always take my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals OSO</a> along for it, as I much prefer to hike in warm weather in them.</p>

<p><strong>Mountaineering</strong> in the Alps and Tatras I did most of the time with the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/grivel-air-tech-new-matic-steigeisen/?pid=81">Grivel Air Tech New-Matic</a> (453 g per crampon) but I also tried the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/camp-xlc-390-steigeisen/">CAMP XLC 390</a> (254 g incl. optional Antibot). The weight difference between these two crampons is almost 200 g so not trivial. I did climb more with the Grivel Air Tech New-Matics and do like them a lot, and these two crampons show that you can use the Rebel Ultra with either a plastic harness or a front bale. The light weight and freedom of movement of the boot of course are great for alpine climbs and the sole is sticky on rock and allows for precise foot placements. I still would switch to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/06/scarpa-stix.html">climbing shoes</a> for more demanding/ technical climbs, but if it are easy routes you’re doing the Rebel Ultra GTX are more than capable. Add in good grip on snow &amp; ice and you have a very efficient mountaineering boot.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>The <a href="">Scarpa Phantom Ultra</a> is a warmer and heavier boot which might attract the same people who’re curious about the Rebel Ultra GTX. If we look at other brands the <a href="http://bit.ly/1xAiXwT">La Sportiva Trango Cube GTX</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/1AhNGww">La Sportiva Batura 2.0 GTX</a> are both lightweight mountaineering boots which can be used for the same activities as the Rebel Ultra GTX.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I’m hard-pressed to come up with something that could be better in this boot. I am sure Scarpa and Ueli had their reasons to use Gore-Tex® instead of OutDry® for this shoe, personally I feel OutDry® is slightly better at keeping moisture out, dries faster and breathes better, but I think the Gore-Tex® lining does a good job in this boot. So really nothing to complain.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>The Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX is a beautiful <em>and</em> ultralight mountaineering boot that is excellent for early and late season ice &amp; mixed climbing and summer mountaineering. It keeps your feet &amp; toes warm till at least -5°C even if you’re just standing around in the snow or hang in the belay, and with the Vibram® sole it is also well suited for easy alpine climbs. I think if you look to up your ice, mixed and alpine climbing by shedding weight and going lighter the Rebel Ultra GTX is the right boot for you. I love my pair and am always happy to put them on, because I know a good day in the outdoors lies ahead of me with them on my feet.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I picked up my pair of <a href="https://lunasandals.refersion.com/c/8168e">OSO sandals</a> in Munich as I was visiting the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/02/ispo-news-2014.html">ISPO</a> and have worn them on the trail in Luxembourg and Poland, on the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2014/">OutDoor 2014</a> and pretty much the last three months every day in Finland.</p>

<p>Sandals and innovations, right? Right. If you saw the features above you quickly will see some things which you likely haven’t read before. The MGT footbed, the ATS laces and the Tech Straps are all innovations when it comes to sandals, or then Barefoot Ted just paid close attention to how the Tarahumara indians made their sandals, and improved a bit on those with modern materials.</p>

<p>These sandals are hand-made by monkeys in Seattle, USA. I couldn’t find any fault with them, and I looked close. And walked a lot in them. They’re high-quality sandals.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The OSO is the heaviest Luna Sandal available and my pair in Size 43,5 weighs 412 g or 206 g for one sandal. The Tech Straps (two) add 18 g to the pair.</p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>Ah well, sandals are shoes. Here in Finland they go into the rubbish bin nowadays and are burned for energy. If the sole is still good you could probably just try to order a new ATS system and rig it yourself, if that was what was broken. And if the sole is walked through, maybe get your shoe maker apply a new one? Or then you really could just put them in the trash and start to walk barefoot.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I settled on the OSO because both <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/">Benjamin</a> and <a href="http://www.infiniteoutdoors.blogspot.de/">Marius</a> had them and liked them. And if those young men can walk in a pair of sandals in the mountains then the strapping young lad that is the author of this website most surely also could walk in them. Should. Would. And thus walking in the mountains with sandals he did.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/lake-district/">Lake District</a> I wished I would have taken the OSOs along. On the Escapardenne Trail I did and hiked 85 km of it in them. And in <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/back-from-the-polish-tatras.html">Poland</a> I hiked five out of seven days in them, much to the surprise of the Mountain Guide I was walking with. Minimal footwear is still an unusual view in the mountains and hills, and a pair of sandals at 2000+ m most certainly has people turn their heads. Which might be dangerous for them if they’re walking on a narrow ridge.</p>

<p>First you will need to learn to walk in them correctly. Walk wrong in these sandals - with your heel first as you might have learned by using high drop, thickly cushioned shoes - and you will get pain. Pain in the heel, knees and your back. The strap will pull uncomfortably into the front of your foot and hurt the top of it. After having used some cushioned shoes I switched into the OSO and walked wrong for a while and quickly experienced that pain. I realized that I walked wrong, and by walking as nature intended the human body to walk - the front first - the pain eased and walking became a pleasure. So much that I have barely used any other shoe in the past three months.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14550172205" title="Luna Sandals OSO by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3855/14550172205_4436dd8d70_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Luna Sandals OSO" /></a></p>

<p>Lets talk a bit about the construction of the OSO. The toe webbing is soft and comfortable and will mould to the space between your toes after a few days of wearing them. At the beginning it was something to get used to, but nowadays I don’t even realize that I have the sandal on and that there’s some webbing between my toes. Much of that has to do with the ATS strap which really is what makes a Luna Sandal a Luna Sandal in my opinion. This is a super-smart system. When they’re new you once need to sit down, fiddle around with the buckle and strap to get it to fit your foot just right, and then that was that. Unlike other Luna Sandals the ATS in the OSO is not elastic so you need to pull it a bit to slip it over your heel, but then it sits there. There’s a MGT rubber lining on the inside of the heel part which helps to keep the strap in place. The same MGT material is on the top webbing before the buckle, with the same comfortable effect. By the way: The whole strap really is just one piece of webbing with a buckle &amp; the plug, which are threaded through the sole and buckle to keep it connected to your foot.</p>

<p>If you go running in the OSO, and it’s perfectly capable of that, then I found the Tech Strap a good Add-on. It is included with the OSO and really is just a Velcro strap that helps to keep your heel strap and ankle secure. While this might sound trivial, it makes the OSO a completely different sandal. With the Tech Strap on the sandal is glued to your foot, no slipping, nothing. It’s just as easy to put the sandal on - it’s still slip-on-and-off-able - as the Tech Strap is just a Velcro strap but makes a world of difference. If you run and like the sandal to be glued to your foot, then you’ll love the Tech Strap.</p>

<p>So running. Trailrunning, really, because running on asphalt still sucks in my opinion. During the winter I ran in a different pair of shoes each day, and I looked forward to the Luna Sandals days. Sure, running on snow at -5°C is a bit fresh, but with a pair of <a href="http://bit.ly/VBOBYP">Injinji Toesocks</a> it’s just fine. You generate a lot of heat when running, so the feet were never cold. The OSO had superb grip on the snow and ice, which surprised me. The OSO kept on surprising me as I was hiking in Luxembourg on the Escapardenne Eisleck Trail, where it rained every day and I was hiking up some slippery, muddy hills. But like a bear the OSO just had grip and didn’t slip. Neither did my foot, thanks to the really grippy MGT footbed.</p>

<p>While my feet got wet and a bit dirty when it rained, they got a nice tan from the sunshine which we had in Finland the last months, including an ATS mark =) I already mentioned the Injinji Toesocks, which are nice on cool evenings or if it’s very windy &amp; rainy or you’re running on snow.</p>

<p>So yeah. The Luna Sandals are my de-facto everyday shoes since about May. Foodshopping. Going to the crag. Travelling. Visiting Fairs. Going to eat ice at the beach. Even now that it gets cooler I still slip into my OSOs when I go out, be it to pick up the Newspaper or going somewhere. Cycling. In the rain. Sunshine. On sand. Gravel. Asphalt.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>If we look at Minimalistic Sandals I’m only aware of <a href="http://bedrocksandals.com/">Bedrock Sandals</a> which have a slight variation on the toe webbing but otherwise are fairly similar to Luna Sandals. There’s a bunch of “traditional” <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/outdoor-sandalen/fuer--maenner/">hiking sandals</a> but honestly, these can not compare with Luna Sandals and are pretty heavy.</p>

<h2 id="what-could-be-better">What Could Be Better</h2>

<p>As they’re hand-made there can be bits of yarn standing over where things were sewn together, and that was what I had with my sandals. I called to Luna Sandals and asked what to do, and the solution to this was to singe the yarns briefly with a lighter to burn off the over-standing yarn or fabric. Done and never had a problem again.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14957855372" title="Luna Sandals OSO by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5564/14957855372_4e0b2a6310_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Luna Sandals OSO" /></a></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>To get back to the intro and elaborate a bit further, as I did to <a href="http://www.vincentkleine.com/">Vincent</a>: The Luna Sandals are one of my favourite bits of kit because they’re simple. They’re comfy. They’re light. They communicate to anyone who see me in them that I like it minimalistic. Going back to nature. Feeling the ground, the air, the mud &amp; rain on my feet. But also the sunshine. Cool breezes on hot summer days.</p>

<p>Sweaty feet are a thing of the past if you wear Luna Sandals. At the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy 2014</a> I was wearing another favourite pair of shoes which are awesome up high and when it’s cold (more on those soon), but down in the summery 35°C of Chamonix they were too hot. Way too hot. And I was happy indeed that I had my Luna Sandals along. Comfy, cool feet down in the valley.</p>

<p>To conclude this wee review: If you want to take the next step in terms of minimal footwear for hiking, backpacking, packrafting and everyday-life and you have a healthy, natural fore-foot stride, get a pair of Luna Sandals. The OSO, which by the way means bear in Español, is a superb, hand-crafted sandal that allows you to experience the nature much closer than in a closed trail running shoe, or God forbid, a boot. It’s a beautiful sandal that once you’ve put it on you will forget is there, and you can concentrate just on the trail ahead, and the hiking, wherever it may lead you.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-your-sandals">Where to buy your Sandals</h2>

<p>You can buy your Luna Sandals from <a href="http://luna-sandals.de/">Luna-Sandals.de</a> and <a href="http://www.racelite.de/luna-oso.html">Racelite</a> in Germany, <a href="http://www.fastway.fi/category/8/luna-sandals">Fastway</a> in Finland, <a href="http://moonlight-gear.com/?pid=44256135">Moonlight Gear</a> in Japan and of course at <a href="https://lunasandals.refersion.com/c/8168e">Luna Sandals</a> in the USA and else where on this globe.

<p>The accompanying book is “<a href="http://amzn.to/1pEbB5d">Born to Run</a>” and you might want to order that at the same time to get into the mood &amp; mind-set. If you are unsure about hiking barefoot but want to give these sandals a try, order a pair of <a href="http://bit.ly/1thAkNq">Injinji</a> <a href="http://bit.ly/1BwIrKM">Toesocks</a> which help to protect your feet a bit more.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Climbing shoes. Like other <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/shoes/">shoes</a> they can be a source of much discussion. The <a href="http://www.scarpa.net/en/stix.html">Scarpa Stix</a> was popular long before I started climbing, was shelved and now makes a return - and it’s easy to feel when climbing with it why this shoe was and is so popular.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14359890633" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3857/14359890633_7b1bf6b62b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I like Scarpa’s climbing shoes. The <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/08/ultralight-climbing.html">Feroce</a> still gets regularly used on rock and plastic, though since I got the Stix late in 2013 it has been my climbing shoe of choice. There’s much to like about the shoe: There’s the weight of just 402 g for the pair in Size 41, the sticky rubber and the precise feel. One thing which really rules for me is that they’re quick and easy to put on and take off. With the Feroce I had three Velcro straps to open and close and the <a href="http://www.scarpa.net/en/techno-x.html">Techno X</a> uses laces. The Stix uses neither - it’s a slipper that hugs my foot for a wonderful snug fit without being constricting or uncomfortable. In case you’re wondering if it easy to lose the shoe - for example when heel or toe hooking: Nope, no chance. The Stix fits like a glove and doesn’t budge.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14153208177" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3914/14153208177_215c9320e1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14153085520" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5477/14153085520_d4f50c85cd_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<p>Much of that superb fit can be attributed to Heinz Mariacher who designed the Stix - a name very closely connected to high-quality climbing shoes. And this shoe does pack a few high-quality features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <em>Vibram® XS Grip 2</em> sole gives grip on rock and plastic alike</li>
  <li>The <em>X-Tension Randing</em> cradles your foot and heel to enhance your toe power</li>
  <li><em>REB - Reinforced Elastic Band</em> are the blue stripes on top of the shoe which improve the fit of the shoe</li>
  <li>Superb craftsmanship and construction</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14316563156" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5526/14316563156_2cb639dd93_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<p>But back to fit for a moment. Once you slip into the shoe, which is easy thanks to the two large tabs at the back and the one on the instep, your large toe right away finds its spot, with the other toes falling in line. While the rubber isn’t super thin, it’s thin enough for a precise feeling of the rock underneath: With the pointy toe box you’ll find pockets without problems, while on tiny ledges you feel like you can reliably and safely weigh down on your foot and know that it will stick. If you prefer slabs (and I really do!) or the climb just has no footholds you will be glad to hear that it’s a fine shoe for smearing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14153076640" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2913/14153076640_520b2ace9f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14336362111" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3864/14336362111_e3dbfb6566_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<p>Which brings us to toe and heel hooking. I like Scarpa shoes because they fit me so well - it sometimes feels like they were designed for my feet - and the heel cup on the Stix is no difference here. A narrow, hugging heel cup without any dead space makes it easy to do precise heel hooks, with sticky rubber going far up the heel on all sides for extra friction. Toe hooks are similar: Because of the great fit for all my toes and the rubber on top it’s comfy &amp; easy to hook with the shoe. As it’s fast to put on &amp; off it’s easy to take the shoes off between pitches or when taking a break from a boulder problem. Even on hot, sunny days the shoe is comfortable to wear and does not create hot spots or overly sweaty feet.</p>

<p>The Stix is reasonably priced for such a high-quality shoe, and using it now since five months a couple of times a week on rock and plastic it feels like they still have a lot of climbing left in them. If you’re in the market for new climbing shoes and Scarpa’s shoes fit your feet well, I’d highly encourage you to try the Stix if you’re bouldering and sports climbing. It’s a highly comfortable shoe which is lightweight with great sensitivity and support that offers grip on narrow ledges, tiny pockets and lets you walk up steep slabs in comfort.</p>
