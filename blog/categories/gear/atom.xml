<p>Favourite gear articles are a staple of blogs and magazines at the end of the year. I see gear as an enabler to my trips, but it‚Äôs not the main thing of this hobby for me. Yes, I consider myself a Gear Nerd, and am happy to geek out about sustainable, lightweight and functional equipment &amp; garments, but being outside in nature is more important. Hence my four picks of ‚Äúfavourite gear‚Äù of 2020 actually only includes three pieces of equipment üòÜ I also want to discourage you from thinking that you have to spend ridiculous amounts of ‚Ç¨¬£$ to get this gear or go to the same places than me. Yes, it‚Äôs great kit, yes, it were amazing trips and the destinations should go on your bucket list. But at the same time: Stay local, minimize your environmental footprint and only buy what you need!</p>

<h2 id="more-time--local-trips">More Time // Local Trips</h2>

<p>I didn‚Äôt have a lot of work in 2020, which means I had a lot more ‚Äúfree‚Äù time. With the Pandemic being the main topic of 2020 and me being rather careful to not expose myself to the virus, I did not (<em>could not</em>) travel as much as usual. Instead I made the best of it and travelled locally - a few trips to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/lemmenjoki-national-park.html">Lapland</a> but mostly <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/nuku-yo-ulkona-kvarken-archipelago.html">locally in my Region</a>. This definitely was my favourite part of 2020, we had some fantastic day trips with the family where we were <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/06/sup-adventures-in-the-kvarken-archipelago.html">SUPing</a> and swimming, having picnics and enjoying the warm, sunny weather. This is something which I will continue to do in 2021 and onwards - mostly travelling in Finland, Norway and Sweden, with just the occasional work trip further abroad.</p>

<h2 id="houdini-fleece-jacket">Houdini Fleece Jacket</h2>

<p>I was thinking, while doing my research for this piece, if the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/11/patagonia-r1-air-review.html">Patagonia R1 Air</a> should be in this article. But the truth is, there is one Fleece Jacket which I have worn substantially more in 2020: The <a href="https://bit.ly/390vFwb">‚àû Houdini Power Air Houdi</a> (it‚Äôs replaced by the Mono Air Hoody nowadays!). I own also an <a href="https://bit.ly/3sJ0pJS">‚àû Outright Houdi</a> (3 years old) and a <a href="https://bit.ly/3o0F6zK">‚àû Power Houdi</a> (6 years old) and love both of those heaps, but the Power Air is what I have worn pretty much every day in 2020. A fleece jacket is part of my every day dress code (Yay for Homeoffice/ being an outdoor journalist!), which goes well with a T-Shirt underneath it and a Windjacket over it if I have to go out. My Power Air Houdi has an amazing purple colour üíú and is 633 g light in Size S - which makes it too heavy for backpacking, but perfect for everyday use and day hikes. I‚Äôve been wearing it while traveling, hiking, and working at home, and I also worn it on overnight trips and <a href="https://youtu.be/OCt38Ybiy7w">photo shoots in the middle of the night</a>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a durable piece of kit which is made from the still relatively new <a href="https://youtu.be/_DBPa0wBNZE">Polartec Power Air</a>; that fabric has a new knit construction which encapsulates air to retain warmth and reduce microfiber shedding - it sheds up to five times less microfibres as other fleece fabrics. It keeps you toasty by encapsulating the insulation in hundreds of tiny pockets, with channels running around them for greater breathability. The fabric is stretchy and the Power Air Houdi has an athletic fit, with a comfy hood for when I forgot to put my beanie on, and two zippered hand pockets if also my gloves stayed home. It‚Äôs a fantastic garment which I‚Äôm wearing while writing this article (I just went out quickly to take the underneath photo) and it makes me happy with its good features, sustainable credentials and purple colour. So it is definitely a jacket which I will continue to wear in 2021!</p>

<h2 id="anfibio-rebel-2k-packraft">Anfibio Rebel 2K packraft</h2>

<p>In the summer of 2020 I travelled to Lapland to go backpacking in the Lemmenjoki National Park and then packrafted alone down the Ivalojoki river. Along on that trip I had the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/09/anfibio-rebel-2k-the-most-versatile-packraft.html">Anfibio REBEL 2K</a> packraft, which I enjoyed from bow to stern üòÜ It‚Äôs compact, lightweight, nimble and can handle white water rafting without problems - everything I want from a packraft. I also had it along on local trips on rivers and on the Baltic Sea, and time and again it made me smile while paddling and carrying it. I‚Äôm already now planning new trips with it in the spring, summer and autumn, and if you are curious about packrafting then look no further than the Anfibio REBEL 2K packraft! <em>The best thing is that you can <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Rentals:::34.html?language=en">loan packrafts</a> starting from 70‚Ç¨ from the Packrafting Store, which is perfect if you want to try this sport without committing to a 1.000,00 ‚Ç¨ or more investment!</em></p>

<h2 id="huckepacks-phoenix">HUCKEPACKS Phoenix</h2>

<p>When Mateusz called me in 2019 and told me he will reopen his cottage, I was really happy for him! Since then I have carried his new pack creations on almost all of my trips in 2020, and the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/09/huckepacks-phoenix-lite-review.html">HUCKEPACKS Phoenix Lite</a> is hands-down the best backpacking rucksack I have used in the past year(s). It‚Äôs 474 g light with all bells &amp; whistles, and carries even heavy loads with lots of food like a dream. The pack handled <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/11/mullerthal-trail-route-1.html">constant rain</a> just fine, and Version 2.0 - which was released last autumn - even improves on the original design. This will also in 2021 be my pack of choice, and I can‚Äôt wait to go backpacking with it again this year!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For 10+ years, I haven‚Äôt worn any jeans. But in autumn 2019 the DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans arrived with me, and in the past two winters they have become my go-to trousers. So much so, that I am wearing it now since four months (and yes, that means it hasn‚Äôt been in the wash that long!).</p>

<p>Since around 2008 I haven‚Äôt worn a pair of jeans. My last jeans were from an Italian brand, but even when I still owned them I didn‚Äôt wear them much. My trousers, or pants, whatever you like to call them, were made from another fabric than denim. Mostly Polyester, but also linen, cotton and other synthetic fabrics were what I liked to wear, and actually still do for most of the year. But in the autumn of 2019 the <a href="https://bit.ly/3s2D4m2">‚àû DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans</a> appeared at my porch, and while I was sceptical at first - I love my Houdini pants to bits - I also was curious to try these jeans, as they feature a water repellant and breathable membrane underneath the denim fabric.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50808928773/in/dateposted/" title="DUER All-Weather Denim"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50808928773_56706b96d0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DUER All-Weather Denim" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809668396/in/dateposted/" title="Instructions // DUER All-Weather Denim"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809668396_7edd02e6f8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Instructions // DUER All-Weather Denim" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The denim fabric is what makes DUER jeans special, as it is not 100% cotton, but the fabric is called L2X Denim and consists of 70% Cotton, 28% Coolmax (that‚Äôs made from Polyester) and 2% Lycra. This makes the jeans more stretchy and rather comfortable to wear, especially for cycling. The denim fabric also has a Silvadur treatment, that‚Äôs a bacterial inhibition treatment to extend the time you can wear the jeans without washes. Right now, as depicted on the photos in this article, the jeans has been worn daily for four months without that it has been in the washing machine. My regular Houdini trousers I wear anywhere between two and four weeks, then it simply is too obvious that I have been wearing the pants for a long time because you can see dirt on them. These DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans have a quite dark fabric, which ‚Äúhides‚Äù dirt easier, but it probably also helps that I usually wear them when it starts to get around 0¬∞C and so there isn‚Äôt too much mud &amp; dirt around - it‚Äôs pretty much all frozen when I wear them.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809786542/in/dateposted/" title="DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans Pockets n Stuff"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809786542_6d8a11887e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans Pockets n Stuff" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Because these pants have a membrane on the inside underneath the denim fabric - that membrane has a water resistance rating of 18.150 mm and a Moisture Vapor Transmission Rate (MVTR) rating of 13.000 G/M2/M24hrs - these are WARM üî• pants. It has to be -5¬∞C or more and really windy for me to put on some <a href="https://tidd.ly/3b8r7VS">‚àû long underwear</a> on underneath them, for temperatures above that the pants are warm enough on their own for me. This makes them really great winter pants in my opinion, as this membrane in combination with the DUER L2X Denim is giving me a pair of trousers which keep wind and snow at bay and me toasty and warm, all while looking like a regular pair of jeans. I can not wear these jeans if it‚Äôs above 5¬∞C, as then I simply run to hot, so for me this is a cold weather jeans. However, it is comfortable also when inside - the usual inside temperature in Finland is around 22¬∞C - and if you‚Äôre not exercising on a bike indoors with these jeans on, then you should feel just fine - that‚Äôs where the <em>breathability</em> of the membrane comes in handy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809787602/in/dateposted/" title="Membrane lining of the DUER All-Weather Denim"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809787602_ed99c18089_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Membrane lining of the DUER All-Weather Denim" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809669991/in/dateposted/" title="DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans Back"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809669991_e11b9f5fd7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans Back" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Alright, they only almost look like a regular pair of jeans, as they have some smart details which make them stand out a wee bit. One detail is the reflective DU/ER logo font on the inside of the trouser legs (it‚Äôs called a cuff, I‚Äôm told =), which makes you more visible in traffic in the dark. This is a wonderful detail and really useful in dark Finland &amp; Scandinavia, and once you‚Äôd arrive at the office, library or Caf√© you could just roll the trouser leg down to hide the reflective detail again. Me, I keep them up, all the time. The pants are a length of 32‚Äù and rolled up it‚Äôs the perfect length for me, and stops just around my ankle.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809669601/in/photostream/" title="Cycling with the DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809669601_896a9fc249_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cycling with the DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There‚Äôs also a reflective logo patch at the waistband, so in case you aren‚Äôt wearing a reflector like every smart non-suicidal person in the North should in winter, you also could be seen via it if you have your jacket that high up. I don‚Äôt but then I have a reflector or two on my jacket. Other features include triple stitched inseams, gussets and back rises, so during all that cycling nothing rips open, double layered back pockets which should be equally durable and long-lasting, and in case you‚Äôre wondering: Yes, this is a five pocket jeans, and I‚Äôm wearing mine in the Slim Cut (there‚Äôs a <a href="https://bit.ly/3q1263g">‚àû Relaxed Jeans</a> available, too).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50809668926/in/dateposted/" title="DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans front"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50809668926_602254a21c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans front" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>These are my go-to pants in winter, usually between late September and around late March, when it starts to get warm again. During these six-ish months I happily put on my DUER All-Weather Denim Jeans every day, and go cycling to the grocery store, walking and sledding with the kids, for a walk in the forest or visit a Caf√© in town for a tasty coffee and some Pulla. They have great freedom of movement - they were made as a cycling jeans, after all - and look rather stylish, but the real selling point for me is that these jeans are made to be outside in cold weather, and that they don‚Äôt need to be washed that often. That‚Äôs good for the environment in several ways, and as these pants are made to last, I expect them to keep my toasty for another eight or nine winters!</p>

<p>If you‚Äôd like to grab a pair for yourself - they are available as a Men‚Äôs and <a href="https://bit.ly/3bhwthz">‚àû¬†Women‚Äôs version</a> - order them either directly from <a href="https://bit.ly/3s2D4m2">‚àû DUER</a> if you‚Äôre in North America, in Europe you can get them from <a href="https://tidd.ly/3b7VbRz">‚àû Bergzeit</a> and in Finland from <a href="https://varuste.net/p99564/duer-all-weather-performance-denim-slim-jeans">Varuste</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>It is toasty warm, it is really light for what it does, and it lets all the air through so you want to wear something over the <a href="https://bit.ly/2UtFMRK">‚àû Patagonia R1 Air</a> so the wind doesn‚Äôt blow away that lovely warm air layer around you! You can <a href="https://youtu.be/7vDo7rT7uv4">watch the Video</a> to get a good idea of this sweet piece of kit.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I bought the <a href="https://bit.ly/3nWwSsi">‚àû Patagonia R1 Air Zip-Neck</a> in October and have been using it for around 10 days as I write this Review, for short day hikes, cycling and picking up the post üòÅ</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583047341/in/album-72157716816476902/" title="Patagucci"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583047341_e4fe099eb1_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Patagucci" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>This is a Midlayer garment made for cold weather and high exertion activities like winter backpacking, trailrunning in cold weather, mountaineering and ski touring. It works well for picking up the Post and Day hikes, too.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>I bought my Zip-Neck in Size S and it fits me perfectly (this is a slim fit garment, and I‚Äôm still 175 cm tall with a weight of 65 kg). It weighs 258 g.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50582306183/in/dateposted/" title="258 g in Size S"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50582306183_f932ba6fdf_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="258 g in Size S" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The features of this Zip-Neck, according to the Patagonia website:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hollow-core fabric with a unique zigzag texture</li>
  <li>A tiny Zippered Chest Pocket</li>
  <li>Off-shoulder seams</li>
  <li>A Half-zip for venting</li>
  <li>Soft Cuffs and Hem</li>
  <li>Fair Trade Certified‚Ñ¢ sewn</li>
  <li>HeiQ Anti-Smell finish</li>
</ul>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50582306843/in/dateposted/" title="Zig. Zag."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50582306843_c6c887102c_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Zig. Zag." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>The fabric of the R1 Air is 100% recycled polyester, which is getting increasingly common nowadays and which is a positive development. Hollow fibres also have been around for a while (used for example in <a href="https://www.fiberpartner.com/products/fibers/hollow-polyester-fibers/">pillows and duvets</a>), and if my memory doesn‚Äôt betray me there are already a few outdoor apparel brands which have used hollow core fabrics in their garments.</p>

<p>Now that zig-zag pattern, which Patagonia says is <em>Unique</em>. I had to re-read my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/11/hoodylicious.html">Hoodylicious</a> article from 2012 as I was thinking that maybe the Silkbody Cellular Pilot Top had a similar fabric pattern, but it did not. My next step was to <a href="https://twitter.com/townsendoutdoor/status/1326852082708656128">consult Chris Townsend</a> as he has forty plus years more experience than me, and also he does not recall seeing such a pattern in outdoor garments before. So there we go, Patagonia indeed is the first to use this zig zag pattern <em>(and it‚Äôs warm &amp; good, as you‚Äôll read in a moment)</em>!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583048346/in/dateposted/" title="Open Zipper"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583048346_1ee8d9adba_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Open Zipper" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>This is a Patagucci, √§h, Patagonia piece. It‚Äôs a premium brand, and you pay a premium price, and so also the quality is premium. The R1 Air line of garments are Fair Trade Certified sewn in Sri Lanka, and the quality is indeed great, as you would expect.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50582304163/in/dateposted/" title="Made in Sri Lanka"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50582304163_89749533df_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Made in Sri Lanka" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>As it is made from 100% recycled polyester and is certified as bluesign¬Æ approved, with a HeiQ biocide finish (which is made from recycled silver salt) this is a garment which makes me smile - because it does well in terms of sustainability. <a href="http://www.kingwhale.com">Kingwhale in Taiwan</a> produces the hollow-core fabric, which is then shipped to Sri Lanka where is is made into the garments which we then wear outdoors. The Zip-Neck arrived with just a small hang tag and in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/plastic-wrapped-outdoor-gear.html">a small plastic bag</a>, so also on that front I am happy. If it is broken you can send it in to Patagonia to <a href="https://bit.ly/3kvDv3l">get it repaired</a>, and if you think it has served you enough over many cold winters, you could send it to Patagonia‚Äôs <a href="https://bit.ly/3eXq5f7">Worn Wear</a> initiative so that they can recycle it, or fix it and let it go on more adventures with someone else.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>Please treat this as an early review. This garment is available since late October 2020 - it was <a href="https://youtu.be/uYtkQtaUAq8">announced at the ISPO in January</a> and hence any ‚ÄúReviews‚Äù you see online should be treated as ‚Äúearly impressions‚Äù after a wee bit of usage - unless you read this in May 2021 üòâ</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583043546/in/dateposted/" title="Thin"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583043546_13f43df6eb_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Thin" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As I wrote above already, I have used this Midlayer now 10 days for short day hikes, cycling and picking up the post. I haven‚Äôt been out backpacking with it, and I also haven‚Äôt used it for <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning</a> as right now it‚Äôs too warm for me to use such a garment for running. Speaking of temperatures - it‚Äôs right now November, with temps between 0¬∞C and 8¬∞C during the day, with frost at night. Already from the little usage I have and my 12+ years experience of winter backpacking I think this garment is made for significantly colder weather than this warm November, so I‚Äôm looking forward to taking it out ski touring and winter backpacking once winter arrives.</p>

<p>But let‚Äôs talk about warmth. Because that‚Äôs the first thing which comes to my mind when I think of this midlayer - it is ridiculously warm. The zig-zag pattern of the fabric allows for really big <em>‚Äúair gaps‚Äù</em> between the tufts of the hollow-core fabric, and these air gaps is what traps the air which your body heat warms up. In practice I believe these hollow core tufts are only there to keep the garment above your skin or baselayer, so that it can create this warm air field around you. It‚Äôs genius, really, and in combination with a wind jacket, hardshell or an insulation jacket it creates a double-sided, really warm layer of air around you. Because the zig-zag pattern is also on the outside, and so under a wind jacket or similar it creates another warm layer of air. I‚Äôm not getting tired of highlighting how amazing the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody</a> is as a windjacket, and it has surprised me to no small means how warm the R1 Air is in combination with that jacket in these cool temperatures. I can cycle with a T-Shirt, the r1 Air and the Alpine Start hoody, in November. Usually I‚Äôd wear a much warmer, heavier and thicker Midlayer + Insulation or Hardshell to not get cold!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583050181/in/dateposted/" title="Running away."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583050181_c593620c04_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Running away." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now on its own, or just over a T-Shirt or another baselayer, I will not use it. The thin fabric, so not the hollow-core tufts, but the cut-outs in-between them, well, they are nothing more than a mesh. You can see it in my Video above at the 4:21 mark really well, where I hold it into the sun and you can see right through it. In practice I have tried using it  on its own, but as I‚Äôm living at the coast we have always a wind blowing, and that wind goes right through the R1 Air and blows away your warm air field. Also when walking faster when in a windless forest I had the same effect - the air goes through it and takes the warmth away. Hence why I say this needs to be used with a jacket above it!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583169452/in/dateposted/" title="More close-ups."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583169452_52eafda0c6_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="More close-ups." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The tiny pocket on it, it‚Äôs good enough for a some <a href="https://trailbutter.eu">Trail Butter</a> pouches or a <a href="https://tidd.ly/3eQpKLn">‚àû Clifbar</a>, you also can fit some batteries in it, but other than that it is small.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583168492/in/album-72157716816476902/" title="Trail Butter Sized Pocket"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583168492_e50038346c_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Trail Butter Sized Pocket" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The big zipper is great for venting, which might be necessary during ascents or when hiking for a longer time. I find it is easy for me to run ‚Äútoo hot‚Äù with the R1 Air in the warm November temperatures, and having the possibility to vent allows me to still use it. Plus, when slowing down, reaching the summit, or pottering around at camp, I simply zip it back up and am toasty warm. The collar on the Zip-Neck is really nice, it closes high and replaces a Buff for me.</p>

<p>Finally, the fabric is supposed to wick sweat quickly away from the skin making for a dry feeling. Now I haven‚Äôt undertaken any really sweat-inducing activities with it yet besides day hikes with a light pack, and on these I had a dry feeling. But if it was because of the moisture-wicking capabilities of the fabric or because I didn‚Äôt sweat that much, I don‚Äôt dare say. The fabric does have a none-smelly HeiQ finish, which is eliminating bad odours and keeps the garment fresh. That‚Äôs probably really useful (if it works) on longer hikes and when you‚Äôre wearing the R1 Air day-in, day-out for a few weeks.</p>

<p>By the way - the R1 Air is also available as a no-frills <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/patagonia-womens-r1-air-crew-fleece-jumper/?pid=10239">‚àû Sweater</a> and a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/patagonia-r1-air-full-zip-hoody-fleece-jacket/?pid=10239">‚àû Full-Zip Hoody</a>. All three styles are available as Womens and Mens versions, in different colours. But the best colour is purple üòé</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I have used this not enough to make some proper suggestions for improvement, but I have some things and features in mind which might make it better. First off are thumbloops. I‚Äôm a fan of these, and especially if gets cold it is nice to get more warmth to my hands with thumbloops. Then there‚Äôs the Pocket: I wonder if a larger pocket would make sense, or if maybe no pocket at all is better on the Zip-Neck (saving a tiny bit of weight)? Right now the Pocket is ok for some snacks or batteries, but even a Smartphone or a Notebook don‚Äôt fit in it. The question is if it needs to be any bigger - a map &amp; compass could go into the chest pocket of the jacket you wear over it, so what need is there for this pocket? It does well to keep snacks warm, though!</p>

<p>Finally, I wonder how durable the material will be. I fear it might be sensitive and only hold up for a few seasons, but it‚Äôs really too early to say this and in May 2021 I should know more about that.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50583166172/in/dateposted/" title="Pocket."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50583166172_0a5eb3ac78_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Pocket." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>It is too soon to call this warmest Midlayer I own just yet, but in the little time I have used it the R1 Air Zip-Neck really has made a very good impression on me. It is soooo warm (too warm for indoor use üòÜ), it is very comfortable on the skin, it is light, it is purple üíú and it has an 1A+ Environmental track record. I can not wait to take it skitouring and backpacking this winter, and see how warm I will be in it. My early use at least suggests that I won‚Äôt feel cold!</p>

<p><strong>If you too don‚Äôt want to feel cold</strong>, head over to <a href="https://bit.ly/3pe27Ru">‚àû Bergfreunde.eu</a> or <a href="https://tidd.ly/38O3AbN">‚àû¬†Bergzeit</a> to buy your own R1 Air when you‚Äôre in Europe. If you‚Äôre in North America, you can buy one from <a href="https://bit.ly/3qvdYKP">‚àû Patagonia</a>. Remember, all styles are available as <a href="https://tidd.ly/3pwXUsy">‚àû Women‚Äôs Versions</a> and <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/patagonia-womens-r1-air-crew-fleece-jumper/?pid=10239">‚àû in different colours</a> in case you don‚Äôt like purple =)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have wanted an ultralight rain jacket and pants since ages - something which is compact, very light and which keeps me dry when it starts to pour down üí¶. I‚Äôm happy to report that I finally got something which fulfils my expectations - the Montane Podium Pull-on &amp; Pants!</p>

<p>In the above Video you see everything which you need to know and I have to say about the <a href="https://www.montane.com/mens-c1/unisex-podium-pull-on-p911">Podium Pull-on Hoody</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.montane.com/search?query=Podium">Pants</a> from Montane - in the rain üåß ! These are Unisex rain garments made for trailrunning, but with a light or <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/under-2-kg-baseweight-sul-summer-backpacking.html">SUL backpack</a> on your shoulders they also work really well. Just don‚Äôt use it if you carry a 15 kg or more heavy pack!</p>

<p>If you squeeze them together in the included stuff sack then the pull-on in Size S weighs 103 g, and the pants is even under 100 g at a mere 98 g. The rain gear I have worn (and still wear on longer trips where more rain is expected) is closer to 1 kg in weight together, so this is a major update &amp; weight saving for summer trips where I can get away with such light kit.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49956161841/in/dateposted/" title="√ñjenskogen Impressions"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49956161841_6fc623970f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="√ñjenskogen Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I also used the pants and Pull-on on my recent <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/impressions-from-lemmenjoki-and-ivalojoki.html">packrafting trip in Lapland</a> as a waterproof jacket + pants while paddling (as I don‚Äôt yet own an <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Kleidung/Anfibio-ZipSuit::703.html">ultralight drysuit</a>!), where they did a great job. On the first day I forgot to switch jackets and the sleeves of my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody</a> got really (soaking) wet, a problem I didn‚Äôt have at all with the Montane Podium Pull-on. So it‚Äôs also multi-use, which is great!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50136774041/in/dateposted/" title="Psyched after running the &quot;hardest&quot; rapid on the trip"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50136774041_89a6246871_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Psyched after running the &quot;hardest&quot; rapid on the trip" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>It obviously also works well as a rainwear kit when <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning</a>, the small pack size means it fits in your trailrunning pack without problems. So if you practice trailrunning at home to keep fit and want something to take along on long runs to keep dry in the rain, this will suit just fine!</p>

<p>The only downside I found with both the pants and Pull-on are that I run really hot under them. Now both garments are made from Montane‚Äôs <em>Aqua Pro Lite</em> fabric which has a breathability rating of 15.000 g/ m2/ 24 h MVTR but in practice I found that it can get sweaty and warm underneath them if you throw them over your normal (hiking) garments. My solutions to this (and as a Disclosure, I do run hot easily!) is to only wear boxer shorts and a T-Shirt underneath them and have the zipper on the Pull-On open as much as possible. That keeps the temperature underneath at a bearable level, especially since I used these in summer temperatures where it was between 15¬∞C and 30¬∞C air temperature. Maybe in spring and autumn when it is cooler and less humid, that it will be less warm under it.</p>

<p>Finally, it‚Äôs not the most durable piece of kit, so do not wear this if you have to bushwhack or carry a heavy 20 kg backpack. The intended purpose is firmly for trailrunning, Ultra runs and not for backpacking - though it is completely fine to use it with an ultralight backpack in my experience. The material is really thin, and very stretchy, and hasn‚Äôt suffered on my trips in the past four months, but then it also hasn‚Äôt rained that much here and hence I haven‚Äôt worn it so often.</p>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, if these looks like something for you and you also want to carry a real UL rain jacket and pack in your pack, which does a good job of keeping you dry in the rain, then you can pick up the <a href="https://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/mens-clothing-c1/mens-waterproof-shell-c51/waterproof-smocks-c202/podium-unisex-waterproof-pull-on-p13318">Montane Podium Pull-on</a> at <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/04/one-stop-shop-ultralight-outdoor-gear.html">Ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk</a>, at <a href="https://amzn.to/31sGVvY">‚àû Amazon.co.uk</a>, where you also can get the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Pv3wTb">‚àû Montane Podium pants</a>. Currently both together cost around 178 ‚Ç¨, which is less than their combined weight üòÅ</p>

<h2 id="why-super-ultralight">WHY Super Ultralight?</h2>

<p>That questions is probably on a lot of readers minds. While I see more &amp; more lightweight backpacks and shelters when I am out <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/destinations/">backpacking in Finland</a>, there are still lots more people backpacking with heavy 80 l Volume backpacks, hiking on established trails &amp; sleeping in our Open Wilderness Huts. Which begs my question: Why so heavy? As you will see in this article, I own &amp; use UL gear since 10+ years, and yet things have to go broken. Which means ultralight equipment - backpacks, sleeping pads, shelters &amp; tents as well as garments, shoes and quilts - is durable and long-lasting, without being overbuilt.</p>

<p>While my base weight is usually somewhere around 3 to 5 kg, in the summer I do SUL trips as it‚Äôs very enjoyable to not carry the heavy camera and tripod, to leave the large backpack at home and simply to enjoy the small pack which carries everything I need for hiking on a trail on a warm summer day. People have a hard time believing that you can fit everything into a 24 l backpack, but hey - equipment materials have become lighter and can be compressed a lot more nowadays, so it‚Äôs pretty easy, as you can see in the accompanying video underneath. So for me going SUL in the summer is about enjoyment, being more connected to nature and the surrounding environment, while being able to cover longer distances without pain &amp; stress. It simply is fun to be out with a light pack, without sacrificing any comfort or safety. And yes, there‚Äôs also some gear-nerdery going on on such trips, and testing what is possible! <strong>You can view the complete list at the end of the article or <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/z1a081">here</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="carrying">Carrying</h2>

<p>Going SUL starts with the backpack for me. I want a comfortable, durable, and obviously really light backpack for short SUL Trips. HUCKEPACKS sent me their amazing <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/specials/packl-special/">PACKL Special</a> in Orange VX07 fabric, and I have been using this pack on short trips and day hikes since the spring. Now at 284 g and an extra 34 g for the foam CCF pad on the inside experienced hikers immediately will say <em>‚ÄúThere are lighter options!‚Äù</em> and they are right. For example the <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/packl-lite/">PACKL Lite</a>, also from HUCKEPACKS, is only 146 g <em>‚Äúheavy‚Äù</em> - that‚Äôs a whooping 138 g less, which in SUL Terms is A LOT. But I have the PACKL Special, and as my other equipment is really light, I can take this <em>slightly heavier</em> backpack üòÉ And with it‚Äôs three extra pockets for organizing and the two mesh pockets for water bottles, this pack keeps my stuff organized and easy to access. It‚Äôs also really pretty, and easy to see which is good if you‚Äôre hunting in areas where there‚Äôs hunting going on. But yeah, I‚Äôm tempted to maybe pick up the PACKL Lite next summer, to go even a bit more light‚Ä¶</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49955656098/in/dateposted/" title="√ñjenskogen Impressions"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49955656098_f20a8457a7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="√ñjenskogen Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sleeping">Sleeping</h2>

<p>MY SUL Sleep System is a combination of old and new gear. It is for me really amazing to see how some equipment has gotten progressively lighter over the last ten years, while other gear already was really light. The foundation of my comfortable &amp; warm sleep system is the <a href="https://tidd.ly/3jQB0JF">‚àû Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Uberlite</a> (<a href="https://youtu.be/5oXFCJi0TII">Here‚Äôs my Review</a>), an amazingly warm &amp; comfortable inflatable sleeping pad which weighs a mere 232 g in the Regular length. That is 120 g lighter than my previous summer UL mattress, the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite.html">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Xlite</a> (which I still own and use regularly). A CCF pad or two could lighter, but honestly - this mattress is so compact in pack size, is so warm, comfortable and easy to use, that I don‚Äôt see a reason to use any other mattress.</p>

<p>My Medium-Length and Standard Width <a href="https://zpacks.com/products/30f-classic-sleeping-bag">ZPACKS Classic Sleeping Bag</a> is 340 g light, and this quilt is 10-ish years old. It‚Äôs a quilt I use on warm summer trips where I know the night temperatures will not go below 5¬∞C (preferably a bit higher, though) and I absolutely LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è the amazing pack size of this quilt. It can be compressed to the size of a small loaf of bread with the cuben stuff-compression bag (18 g), something I can not do with my similarly great <a href="https://katabaticgear.com/shop/chisos-sleeping-bag/">Katabatic Gear Chisos 40¬∞F quilt</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, so keep the Mosquitos away and stay protected from dew and rain splatters, I use the <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/millaris-bivy-sack/">As Tucas Millaris Bivy</a>. It‚Äôs 180 g light including the stuff sack, and is really spacious and also fits my winter sleeping bags. It works best against Mosquitos with two pegs to stake out the front, and then you can create with the elastic string a spacious interior space to sleep in, Mosquito-free. I used this sleep system also on my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/impressions-from-lemmenjoki-and-ivalojoki.html">recent trip in Lapland</a>, where it did a great job.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50137012222/in/dateposted/" title="Bed"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50137012222_214854e72b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bed" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="shelter">Shelter</h2>

<p>In addition to the aforementioned Bivy I also carry a tarp on my SUL Trips. You simply never can know when it starts to rain, or when the wind starts to blow so much that you want more protection. Hence a tarp. This <a href="https://www.gossamergear.com/collections/shelters-sleeping-pads/products/twinn-tarp">Gossamer Gear Tarp</a> isn‚Äôt made anymore, as I have a SUL Cuben version which weighs a mere 167 g incl. the straps. I also own &amp; can recommend the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=47cd1998-e608-4548-aa0f-3d33e964ad3a&amp;website_id=a037a589-aec6-4e81-920c-77b10ab91eff&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hyperlitemountaingear.com%2Fcollections%2Fultralight-backpacking-shelters-tents%2Fproducts%2Fflat-tarp">‚àû Hyperlite Mountain Gear Flat Tarp</a> but it‚Äôs a bit heavier with all the straps. I still love tarps and especially with a bivy it‚Äôs a great setup, also in bad, rainy and windy weather. This tarp is really spacious, and pretty easy to pitch thanks to the Catenary curves - that way it‚Äôs simple to get a good, tight pitch.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50165394418/in/dateposted/" title="SUL Setup Summer 2020"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50165394418_6e73f70bca_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="SUL Setup Summer 2020" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="kitchen">Kitchen</h2>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/the-2nd-renaissance-of-esbit.html">Back in 2013 I wrote about Esbit</a> and the Solid Fuel Cook System from LiteTrail is still what I use today on SUL trips in the summer. It‚Äôs still amazingly compact, easy to use, efficient and at 90 g for the stove, ground + windscreen, pot with lid and the stuff sack hard to beat. I also have a tiny 8 g knife in the pot, my foldable Esbit Spoon - though in a pinch you also could simply use a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/lifeventure-titanium-long-handled-spoon/?pid=10239">‚àûlong-handled spoon</a> instead - and the Esbit fuel tablets.</p>

<p>For water filtering and transport I have an old <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/salomon-soft-flask-std-42-water-bottle/?pid=10239">‚àû 500 ml Flask</a> and a <a href="https://youtu.be/CneJY3F6zuY">Katadyn BeFree</a> - though I have heard a lot of good about the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/salomon-soft-flask-xa-filter-water-bottle/?pid=10239">‚àû Salomon Soft Flask XA Filter</a> which is a bit lighter, but has a smaller volume. Nevertheless, I‚Äôd be curious to try the Salomon filter at some point - sadly a Waterfilter is something which one nowadays also should use in Finland, especially in areas where there‚Äôs a lot of other backpackers and hikers.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50166216747/in/dateposted/" title="SUL Esbit Kitchen"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50166216747_c150b7bb0f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="SUL Esbit Kitchen" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="hygiene">Hygiene</h2>

<p>My hygiene stuff is properly light - everything together a scant 37 g. I was lucky enough to find a foldable toothbrush years ago and I should have bought a few to stash away for the future. I also bring tooth silk and a tooth pick along because clean teeth are a bliss. I am using <a href="https://amzn.to/3fd2AgD">‚àû Dent Tabs</a> since many years - they‚Äôre easy to pack and use, really light and leave less trash than a tube of tooth paste. I tried dehydrating my own Dent Tabs, but that wasn‚Äôt successful so the ones from DentTabs they are! For soap and cleaning I use nothing else than <a href="https://amzn.to/313znzB">‚àû Dr. Bronners Peppermint</a>, I also have a few painkillers along, and a <a href="https://amzn.to/2BIt1xd">‚àû Lipbalm from ClimbOn</a>. The Lipbalm also works really well for small scratches, wounds and blisters, so is proper Multiuse. It‚Äôs also made from 100% natural materials, which is always a plus in my book. All that hygiene stuff goes into a 10 year old ZPacks Cuben fibre bag, which still holds up really well. And yes, toilet paper is missing in the list and is needed, but won‚Äôt slow me down üòâ</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50168619983/in/dateposted/" title="SUL Hygiene kit"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50168619983_1b5e51d53f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="SUL Hygiene kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="appareal">Appareal</h2>

<p>Lets start with the last bits of civilization: My wallet, keys, Suunto watch and phone. I bought a nice <a href="https://www.treadlitegear.co.uk/tread-lite-gear-zip-coin-card-case-wallet-from-83g-336-p.asp">wallet from Treadlite Gear</a> in which I have some Credit Cards and cash. My keys I usually leave at home/ car/ hotel depending on the trip, so these are not carried. On SUL trips I don‚Äôt take a camera as my Full Format <a href="https://amzn.to/2X9sE6d">‚àûSony A7 III</a> with the <a href="https://amzn.to/3jQ8x6P">‚àû GMaster 24-70 mm f/ 2.8 lens</a> is <strong>REALLY</strong> heavy, and the camera of my iPhone 7 is still plenty good for snaps in good weather. I am tempted to take my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/sony-rx100-iv-field-report.html">Sony RX 100 IV</a> at times, but then that is an additional 291 g ‚Ä¶ I also use the iPhone together with the <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/383480947">‚àû Hikepack App</a> for navigation, and I can get 4 days of use out of the phone if it is in Airplane mode and with Battery Savings on. In addition I have the <a href="https://amzn.to/2X8JaUb">‚àû Suunto Spartan Ultra</a> on my wrist which I use for tracking and navigation.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50032347368/in/dateposted/" title="Selfie on the M√§lsorleden"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50032347368_ee84847a0d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Selfie on the M√§lsorleden" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Depending on the weather + bugs to be expected I either wear shorts or a long pants. I have been a Houdini Friend in the past, and still am buying and wearing their garments if they suit me well, so most things are from Houdini - even if there are lighter options available, but I have these, the company does well for both people and the environment, so there‚Äôs no reason for me to buy different things. So, my <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/en-eu/clothing/shorts/ms-daybreak-shorts-249874?color=249874106">Daybreak Shorts</a> come on if I don‚Äôt expect a lot of Mosquitos and a lot of sun, and if the bugs are out then I put on the <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/en-eu/clothing/pants/ms-motion-pants-245174?color=245174174">Motion Lite Pants</a>. Both have zippered pockets, are durable, comfortable, have great freedom of movement and I can wear them for days on end.</p>

<p>On top I usually have a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/houdini-activist-tee-t-shirt/?pid=10239">‚àû Houdini Activist T-Shirt</a> as the material mix of Merino Wool and Lyocell is working really well for me, I can have this on for a week without a problem. You might see white sweat stains after that time, but it doesn‚Äôt smell bad and is still comfy to wear. Depending on the bugs/ wind/ sunshine I also might be wearing the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start windjacket</a>, which is still - 7 years later! - my favourite wind jacket. Underneath I usually wear <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/ortovox-120-comp-light-boxer-merino-base-layer/?pid=10239">‚àû Ortovox Comp Light Boxers</a>, at 54 g and being without any seams these are after much testing the best boxer shorts I have found. Their wide elastic ‚Äúbelt‚Äù doesn‚Äôt push or anything bad, it‚Äôs simply a really well designed boxer shorts which is very comfortable, again with the benefits of Merino Wool. If I wear shoes and socks, then the latter usually are <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/darn-tough-unstandard-stripe-crew-lightweight-with-cushion-sports-socks/?pid=10239">‚àû Darn Tough Socks</a> as these are simply really good - comfortable &amp; durable.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50057615823/in/dateposted/" title="LUNA Sandals OSO Flaco"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50057615823_f1e1f665f9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="LUNA Sandals OSO Flaco" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Footwear-wise I like to hike in the summer in my <a href="https://bit.ly/2BFopb7">‚àû Luna Sandals OSO Flaco</a>, these are simply AMAZING sandals and as soon as it is warm enough in Finland I will pretty much wear them all the time. But if it looks like there‚Äôs going to be rain, cold weather, lots of swamps to cross or mountains to climb, then other shoes come on. On my last trip I tried the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/inov-8-mudclaw-g-260-trail-running-shoes/?pid=10239">‚àû inov-8 Mudclaw G 260</a> which let me done a bit durability-wise, in wet weather I‚Äôm a huge fan of the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/la-sportiva-crossover-2-dot-0-gtx.html">La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX</a>, but I also use shoes from <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/brands/salomon/trail-running-shoes/?pid=10239">‚àû Salomon</a>, <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/on-cloudventure-peak-trail-running-shoes-bf/?pid=10239">‚àû On Running</a> and many other models from <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/brands/la-sportiva/trail-running-shoes-bf/for--men/?pid=10239">‚àû La Sportiva</a>.</p>

<p>In my pack I have three extra garment pieces on SUL Trips: The <a href="https://www.phdesigns.co.uk/waferlite-down-jacket-k-series">PHD WaferLite Down Jacket</a> which is hands-down the lightest and best down insulation piece I own for summer trips. 132 g light with a full zipper, it‚Äôs just the right jacket for fresh summer evenings where a cold wind blows or you need to huddle down in the rain under the tarp. The second and third apparel pieces are the <a href="https://www.montane.co.uk/mens-c1/unisex-podium-pull-on-p911">Montan Podium Pull-On</a> and <a href="https://www.montane.co.uk/unisex-c314/unisex-podium-pants-p910">Podium pants</a>. I wanted an SUL rain pants + jacket since ages, and was happy when Montane asked if I‚Äôd like to try them. These are quite a treat to carry at a combined weight of 203 g, and in the rain showers and thunderstorms I used them they have performed just fine and as you‚Äôd expect: They keep you dry.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49956161841/in/dateposted/" title="√ñjenskogen Impressions"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49956161841_6fc623970f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="√ñjenskogen Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As seen above, I also wear a cap and sunglasses. My eyes are sensitive to the sun, so a pair of protective shades like the <a href="https://tidd.ly/3094EBX">‚àû Oakley Latch</a> are mandatory for me on summer trips. The <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/patagonia-boardshort-label-funfarer-cap-cap/?pid=10239">‚àû Patagonia Boardshort Funfarer Cap</a> is comfortable and has a closed back, which I prefer in Mosquito season. And while it isn‚Äôt in my list, if I expect <strong>A LOT OF MOSQUITOS</strong> then the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/sea-to-summit-nano-mosquito-headnet-mosquito-net/?pid=10239">‚àû Sea to Summit Nano Mosquito Headnet</a> comes along (11 g extra, and so worth it!).</p>

<h2 id="food">Food</h2>

<p>I have a 95% Vegan diet since two years now, and it‚Äôs amazing how easy it is to eat healthy and tasty vegan food when outdoors. There‚Äôs a host of companies which make amazing vegan backpacking meals, so for people without the time to make meals yourself these are a really good option. I‚Äôm a huge fan of the <a href="https://tentmeals.co.uk/collections/main-meals">Tentmeals</a> meals &amp; breakfasts (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">My Patreons get a 25% Discount!</a>), the <a href="https://www.firepotfood.com/collections/firepot-dehydrated-meals/vegan">Firepot Vegan meals</a> are absolutely delicious and also the Vegan options from <a href="https://tidd.ly/2X2n0CX">‚àû LYO Food</a> are always something to look forward to after a day of hiking or packrafting. From back in the day when I also was eating meat, fish and poultry I can recommend meals from the aforementioned brands and also <a href="https://realoutdoorfood.com/products/">REAL Turmat</a>.</p>

<p>Snack-wise I mix Chili Nuts and Honey-Roasted Nuts together, this is my absolute ‚Äú<strong>Feel-Good Food</strong>‚Äù which helps me to stay motivated when I have a long day or a steep climb up a mountain. Similiarly I use <a href="https://tidd.ly/2P6YYSG">‚àû Clif Bar Shot Bloks</a> as these are easy to consume, tasty, and the ones with coffein allow me to skip the coffee breaks if the day calls for it. Speaking of coffee, I use <a href="https://www.naturata.de/bio-produkte/kaffee-kakao/espresso-kaffee-sticks-bohnenkaffee-instant-25g/">Naturata Espresso Sticks</a>  since this year, it‚Äôs easier to get than than Starbucks Via, in my opinion even tastier, and it‚Äôs also Fair Trade and Organic.</p>

<p>This article, <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/z1a081">list</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/sYMGl8INJMo">video</a> show that it is nowadays extremely easy to carry really little &amp; very light equipment on your backpacking trips while still being safe, comfortable, well-fed, dry in the rain and warm at night. 95% of people hiking on maintained trails don‚Äôt need much more than what is shown in the article - and even if they do (a map and compass is a good addition, as could be a powerbank and maybe some fresh clothes for camp) the added weight still will have them carry less than what the majority of people seem to carry outdoors in Finland. Which is not to say those carrying more are doing something wrong, as they are not, though I often encounter these people bent forward from their heavy backpacks, which they put down as soon as an opportunity arises.</p>

<p>That gives the appearance that with a heavy backpack the hiking part of a backpacking trip isn‚Äôt enjoyed a lot, and for me that is where I see most of nature and I get the most enjoyment. With a light pack I can walk straight and unencumbered, I am able to let my eyes take in the surroundings - be it the Black-throated loon on the lake, the Reindeer which is grazing a few meters besides me on the fjell, the Marmot which is alerting it‚Äôs family of my arrival or the beautiful wildflowers which grow along the trail. For me the hiking part is where I see most on my trips, which makes me feel happy, and hence it is for me a lot more enjoyable to hike with a SUL Pack in the summer! I hope you try some of the things in this article, and if you have questions, feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a>!</p>
