Definitely not for beginners, but for advanced backpackers a way to get even more enjoyment when hiking, while also sleeping comfortably &amp; warm at camp! Don‚Äôt ponder around, read on and see my SUL Gear List for short summer trips!</p>

<h2 id="why-super-ultralight">WHY Super Ultralight?</h2>

<p>That questions is probably on a lot of readers minds. While I see more &amp; more lightweight backpacks and shelters when I am out <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/destinations/">backpacking in Finland</a>, there are still lots more people backpacking with heavy 80 l Volume backpacks, hiking on established trails &amp; sleeping in our Open Wilderness Huts. Which begs my question: Why so heavy? As you will see in this article, I own &amp; use UL gear since 10+ years, and yet things have to go broken. Which means ultralight equipment - backpacks, sleeping pads, shelters &amp; tents as well as garments, shoes and quilts - is durable and long-lasting, without being overbuilt.</p>

<p>While my base weight is usually somewhere around 3 to 5 kg, in the summer I do SUL trips as it‚Äôs very enjoyable to not carry the heavy camera and tripod, to leave the large backpack at home and simply to enjoy the small pack which carries everything I need for hiking on a trail on a warm summer day. People have a hard time believing that you can fit everything into a 24 l backpack, but hey - equipment materials have become lighter and can be compressed a lot more nowadays, so it‚Äôs pretty easy, as you can see in the accompanying video underneath. So for me going SUL in the summer is about enjoyment, being more connected to nature and the surrounding environment, while being able to cover longer distances without pain &amp; stress. It simply is fun to be out with a light pack, without sacrificing any comfort or safety. And yes, there‚Äôs also some gear-nerdery going on on such trips, and testing what is possible! <strong>You can view the complete list at the end of the article or <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/z1a081">here</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="carrying">Carrying</h2>

<p>Going SUL starts with the backpack for me. I want a comfortable, durable, and obviously really light backpack for short SUL Trips. HUCKEPACKS sent me their amazing <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/specials/packl-special/">PACKL Special</a> in Orange VX07 fabric, and I have been using this pack on short trips and day hikes since the spring. Now at 284 g and an extra 34 g for the foam CCF pad on the inside experienced hikers immediately will say <em>‚ÄúThere are lighter options!‚Äù</em> and they are right. For example the <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de/store/packs/packl-lite/">PACKL Lite</a>, also from HUCKEPACKS, is only 146 g <em>‚Äúheavy‚Äù</em> - that‚Äôs a whooping 138 g less, which in SUL Terms is A LOT. But I have the PACKL Special, and as my other equipment is really light, I can take this <em>slightly heavier</em> backpack üòÉ And with it‚Äôs three extra pockets for organizing and the two mesh pockets for water bottles, this pack keeps my stuff organized and easy to access. It‚Äôs also really pretty, and easy to see which is good if you‚Äôre hunting in areas where there‚Äôs hunting going on. But yeah, I‚Äôm tempted to maybe pick up the PACKL Lite next summer, to go even a bit more light‚Ä¶</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49955656098/in/dateposted/" title="√ñjenskogen Impressions"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49955656098_f20a8457a7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="√ñjenskogen Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sleeping">Sleeping</h2>

<p>MY SUL Sleep System is a combination of old and new gear. It is for me really amazing to see how some equipment has gotten progressively lighter over the last ten years, while other gear already was really light. The foundation of my comfortable &amp; warm sleep system is the <a href="https://tidd.ly/3jQB0JF">‚àû Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Uberlite</a> (<a href="https://youtu.be/5oXFCJi0TII">Here‚Äôs my Review</a>), an amazingly warm &amp; comfortable inflatable sleeping pad which weighs a mere 232 g in the Regular length. That is 120 g lighter than my previous summer UL mattress, the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite.html">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Xlite</a> (which I still own and use regularly). A CCF pad or two could lighter, but honestly - this mattress is so compact in pack size, is so warm, comfortable and easy to use, that I don‚Äôt see a reason to use any other mattress.</p>

<p>My Medium-Length and Standard Width <a href="https://zpacks.com/products/30f-classic-sleeping-bag">ZPACKS Classic Sleeping Bag</a> is 340 g light, and this quilt is 10-ish years old. It‚Äôs a quilt I use on warm summer trips where I know the night temperatures will not go below 5¬∞C (preferably a bit higher, though) and I absolutely LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è the amazing pack size of this quilt. It can be compressed to the size of a small loaf of bread with the cuben stuff-compression bag (18 g), something I can not do with my similarly great <a href="https://katabaticgear.com/shop/chisos-sleeping-bag/">Katabatic Gear Chisos 40¬∞F quilt</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, so keep the Mosquitos away and stay protected from dew and rain splatters, I use the <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/millaris-bivy-sack/">As Tucas Millaris Bivy</a>. It‚Äôs 180 g light including the stuff sack, and is really spacious and also fits my winter sleeping bags. It works best against Mosquitos with two pegs to stake out the front, and then you can create with the elastic string a spacious interior space to sleep in, Mosquito-free. I used this sleep system also on my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/07/impressions-from-lemmenjoki-and-ivalojoki.html">recent trip in Lapland</a>, where it did a great job.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50137012222/in/dateposted/" title="Bed"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50137012222_214854e72b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bed" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="shelter">Shelter</h2>

<p>In addition to the aforementioned Bivy I also carry a tarp on my SUL Trips. You simply never can know when it starts to rain, or when the wind starts to blow so much that you want more protection. Hence a tarp. This <a href="https://www.gossamergear.com/collections/shelters-sleeping-pads/products/twinn-tarp">Gossamer Gear Tarp</a> isn‚Äôt made anymore, as I have a SUL Cuben version which weighs a mere 167 g incl. the straps. I also own &amp; can recommend the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=47cd1998-e608-4548-aa0f-3d33e964ad3a&amp;website_id=a037a589-aec6-4e81-920c-77b10ab91eff&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hyperlitemountaingear.com%2Fcollections%2Fultralight-backpacking-shelters-tents%2Fproducts%2Fflat-tarp">‚àû Hyperlite Mountain Gear Flat Tarp</a> but it‚Äôs a bit heavier with all the straps. I still love tarps and especially with a bivy it‚Äôs a great setup, also in bad, rainy and windy weather. This tarp is really spacious, and pretty easy to pitch thanks to the Catenary curves - that way it‚Äôs simple to get a good, tight pitch.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50165394418/in/dateposted/" title="SUL Setup Summer 2020"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50165394418_6e73f70bca_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="SUL Setup Summer 2020" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="kitchen">Kitchen</h2>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/the-2nd-renaissance-of-esbit.html">Back in 2013 I wrote about Esbit</a> and the Solid Fuel Cook System from LiteTrail is still what I use today on SUL trips in the summer. It‚Äôs still amazingly compact, easy to use, efficient and at 90 g for the stove, ground + windscreen, pot with lid and the stuff sack hard to beat. I also have a tiny 8 g knife in the pot, my foldable Esbit Spoon - though in a pinch you also could simply use a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/lifeventure-titanium-long-handled-spoon/?pid=10239">‚àûlong-handled spoon</a> instead - and the Esbit fuel tablets.</p>

<p>For water filtering and transport I have an old <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/salomon-soft-flask-std-42-water-bottle/?pid=10239">‚àû 500 ml Flask</a> and a <a href="https://youtu.be/CneJY3F6zuY">Katadyn BeFree</a> - though I have heard a lot of good about the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/salomon-soft-flask-xa-filter-water-bottle/?pid=10239">‚àû Salomon Soft Flask XA Filter</a> which is a bit lighter, but has a smaller volume. Nevertheless, I‚Äôd be curious to try the Salomon filter at some point - sadly a Waterfilter is something which one nowadays also should use in Finland, especially in areas where there‚Äôs a lot of other backpackers and hikers.</p>

<h2 id="hygiene">Hygiene</h2>

<p>My hygiene stuff is properly light - everything together a scant 37 g. I was lucky enough to find a foldable toothbrush years ago and I should have bought a few to stash away for the future. I also bring tooth silk and a tooth pick along because clean teeth are a bliss. I am using <a href="https://amzn.to/3fd2AgD">‚àû Dent Tabs</a> since many years - they‚Äôre easy to pack and use, really light and leave less trash than a tube of tooth paste. I tried dehydrating my own Dent Tabs, but that wasn‚Äôt successful so the ones from DentTabs they are! For soap and cleaning I use nothing else than <a href="https://amzn.to/313znzB">‚àû Dr. Bronners Peppermint</a>, I also have a few painkillers along, and a <a href="https://amzn.to/2BIt1xd">‚àû Lipbalm from ClimbOn</a>. The Lipbalm also works really well for small scratches, wounds and blisters, so is proper Multiuse. It‚Äôs also made from 100% natural materials, which is always a plus in my book. All that hygiene stuff goes into a 10 year old ZPacks Cuben fibre bag, which still holds up really well. And yes, toilet paper is missing in the list and is needed, but won‚Äôt slow me down üòâ</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50168619983/in/dateposted/" title="SUL Hygiene kit"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50168619983_1b5e51d53f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="SUL Hygiene kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="appareal">Appareal</h2>

<p>Lets start with the last bits of civilization: My wallet, keys, Suunto watch and phone. I bought a nice <a href="https://www.treadlitegear.co.uk/tread-lite-gear-zip-coin-card-case-wallet-from-83g-336-p.asp">wallet from Treadlite Gear</a> in which I have some Credit Cards and cash. My keys I usually leave at home/ car/ hotel depending on the trip, so these are not carried. On SUL trips I don‚Äôt take a camera as my Full Format <a href="https://amzn.to/2X9sE6d">‚àûSony A7 III</a> with the <a href="https://amzn.to/3jQ8x6P">‚àû GMaster 24-70 mm f/ 2.8 lens</a> is <strong>REALLY</strong> heavy, and the camera of my iPhone 7 is still plenty good for snaps in good weather. I am tempted to take my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/sony-rx100-iv-field-report.html">Sony RX 100 IV</a> at times, but then that is an additional 291 g ‚Ä¶ I also use the iPhone together with the <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/383480947">‚àû Hikepack App</a> for navigation, and I can get 4 days of use out of the phone if it is in Airplane mode and with Battery Savings on. In addition I have the <a href="https://amzn.to/2X8JaUb">‚àû Suunto Spartan Ultra</a> on my wrist which I use for tracking and navigation.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50032347368/in/dateposted/" title="Selfie on the M√§lsorleden"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50032347368_ee84847a0d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Selfie on the M√§lsorleden" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Depending on the weather + bugs to be expected I either wear shorts or a long pants. I have been a Houdini Friend in the past, and still am buying and wearing their garments if they suit me well, so most things are from Houdini - even if there are lighter options available, but I have these, the company does well for both people and the environment, so there‚Äôs no reason for me to buy different things. So, my <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/en-eu/clothing/shorts/ms-daybreak-shorts-249874?color=249874106">Daybreak Shorts</a> come on if I don‚Äôt expect a lot of Mosquitos and a lot of sun, and if the bugs are out then I put on the <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/en-eu/clothing/pants/ms-motion-pants-245174?color=245174174">Motion Lite Pants</a>. Both have zippered pockets, are durable, comfortable, have great freedom of movement and I can wear them for days on end.</p>

<p>On top I usually have a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/houdini-activist-tee-t-shirt/?pid=10239">‚àû Houdini Activist T-Shirt</a> as the material mix of Merino Wool and Lyocell is working really well for me, I can have this on for a week without a problem. You might see white sweat stains after that time, but it doesn‚Äôt smell bad and is still comfy to wear. Depending on the bugs/ wind/ sunshine I also might be wearing the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start windjacket</a>, which is still - 7 years later! - my favourite wind jacket. Underneath I usually wear <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/ortovox-120-comp-light-boxer-merino-base-layer/?pid=10239">‚àû Ortovox Comp Light Boxers</a>, at 54 g and being without any seams these are after much testing the best boxer shorts I have found. Their wide elastic ‚Äúbelt‚Äù doesn‚Äôt push or anything bad, it‚Äôs simply a really well designed boxer shorts which is very comfortable, again with the benefits of Merino Wool. If I wear shoes and socks, then the latter usually are <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/darn-tough-unstandard-stripe-crew-lightweight-with-cushion-sports-socks/?pid=10239">‚àû Darn Tough Socks</a> as these are simply really good - comfortable &amp; durable.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50057615823/in/dateposted/" title="LUNA Sandals OSO Flaco"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50057615823_f1e1f665f9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="LUNA Sandals OSO Flaco" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Footwear-wise I like to hike in the summer in my <a href="https://bit.ly/2BFopb7">‚àû Luna Sandals OSO Flaco</a>, these are simply AMAZING sandals and as soon as it is warm enough in Finland I will pretty much wear them all the time. But if it looks like there‚Äôs going to be rain, cold weather, lots of swamps to cross or mountains to climb, then other shoes come on. On my last trip I tried the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/inov-8-mudclaw-g-260-trail-running-shoes/?pid=10239">‚àû inov-8 Mudclaw G 260</a> which let me done a bit durability-wise, in wet weather I‚Äôm a huge fan of the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/la-sportiva-crossover-2-dot-0-gtx.html">La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX</a>, but I also use shoes from <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/brands/salomon/trail-running-shoes/?pid=10239">‚àû Salomon</a>, <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/on-cloudventure-peak-trail-running-shoes-bf/?pid=10239">‚àû On Running</a> and many other models from <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/brands/la-sportiva/trail-running-shoes-bf/for--men/?pid=10239">‚àû La Sportiva</a>.</p>

<p>In my pack I have three extra garment pieces on SUL Trips: The <a href="https://www.phdesigns.co.uk/waferlite-down-jacket-k-series">PHD WaferLite Down Jacket</a> which is hands-down the lightest and best down insulation piece I own for summer trips. 132 g light with a full zipper, it‚Äôs just the right jacket for fresh summer evenings where a cold wind blows or you need to huddle down in the rain under the tarp. The second and third apparel pieces are the <a href="https://www.montane.co.uk/mens-c1/unisex-podium-pull-on-p911">Montan Podium Pull-On</a> and <a href="https://www.montane.co.uk/unisex-c314/unisex-podium-pants-p910">Podium pants</a>. I wanted an SUL rain pants + jacket since ages, and was happy when Montane asked if I‚Äôd like to try them. These are quite a treat to carry at a combined weight of 203 g, and in the rain showers and thunderstorms I used them they have performed just fine and as you‚Äôd expect: They keep you dry.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49956161841/in/dateposted/" title="√ñjenskogen Impressions"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49956161841_6fc623970f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="√ñjenskogen Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As seen above, I also wear a cap and sunglasses. My eyes are sensitive to the sun, so a pair of protective shades like the <a href="https://tidd.ly/3094EBX">‚àû Oakley Latch</a> are mandatory for me on summer trips. The <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/patagonia-boardshort-label-funfarer-cap-cap/?pid=10239">‚àû Patagonia Boardshort Funfarer Cap</a> is comfortable and has a closed back, which I prefer in Mosquito season. And while it isn‚Äôt in my list, if I expect <strong>A LOT OF MOSQUITOS</strong> then the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/sea-to-summit-nano-mosquito-headnet-mosquito-net/?pid=10239">‚àû Sea to Summit Nano Mosquito Headnet</a> comes along (11 g extra, and so worth it!).</p>

<h2 id="food">Food</h2>

<p>I have a 95% Vegan diet since two years now, and it‚Äôs amazing how easy it is to eat healthy and tasty vegan food when outdoors. There‚Äôs a host of companies which make amazing vegan backpacking meals, so for people without the time to make meals yourself these are a really good option. I‚Äôm a huge fan of the <a href="https://tentmeals.co.uk/collections/main-meals">Tentmeals</a> meals &amp; breakfasts (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">My Patreons get a 25% Discount!</a>), the <a href="https://www.firepotfood.com/collections/firepot-dehydrated-meals/vegan">Firepot Vegan meals</a> are absolutely delicious and also the Vegan options from <a href="https://tidd.ly/2X2n0CX">‚àû LYO Food</a> are always something to look forward to after a day of hiking or packrafting. From back in the day when I also was eating meat, fish and poultry I can recommend meals from the aforementioned brands and also <a href="https://realoutdoorfood.com/products/">REAL Turmat</a>.</p>

<p>Snack-wise I mix Chili Nuts and Honey-Roasted Nuts together, this is my absolute ‚Äú<strong>Feel-Good Food</strong>‚Äù which helps me to stay motivated when I have a long day or a steep climb up a mountain. Similiarly I use <a href="https://tidd.ly/2P6YYSG">‚àû Clif Bar Shot Bloks</a> as these are easy to consume, tasty, and the ones with coffein allow me to skip the coffee breaks if the day calls for it. Speaking of coffee, I use <a href="https://www.naturata.de/bio-produkte/kaffee-kakao/espresso-kaffee-sticks-bohnenkaffee-instant-25g/">Naturata Espresso Sticks</a>  since this year, it‚Äôs easier to get than than Starbucks Via, in my opinion even tastier, and it‚Äôs also Fair Trade and Organic.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50165422998/in/dateposted/" title="Light &amp; tasty food"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50165422998_a9c6bcd8a2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Light &amp; tasty food" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>

<p>This article, <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/z1a081">list</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/sYMGl8INJMo">video</a> show that it is nowadays extremely easy to carry really little &amp; very light equipment on your backpacking trips while still being safe, comfortable, well-fed, dry in the rain and warm at night. 95% of people hiking on maintained trails don‚Äôt need much more than what is shown in the article - and even if they do (a map and compass is a good addition, as could be a powerbank and maybe some fresh clothes for camp) the added weight still will have them carry less than what the majority of people seem to carry outdoors in Finland. Which is not to say those carrying more are doing something wrong, as they are not, though I often encounter these people bent forward from their heavy backpacks, which they put down as soon as an opportunity arises.</p>

<p>That gives the appearance that with a heavy backpack the hiking part of a backpacking trip isn‚Äôt enjoyed a lot, and for me that is where I see most of nature and I get the most enjoyment. With a light pack I can walk straight and unencumbered, I am able to let my eyes take in the surroundings - be it the Black-throated loon on the lake, the Reindeer which is grazing a few meters besides me on the fjell, the Marmot which is alerting it‚Äôs family of my arrival or the beautiful wildflowers which grow along the trail. For me the hiking part is where I see most on my trips, which makes me feel happy, and hence it is for me a lot more enjoyable to hike with a SUL Pack in the summer! I hope you try some of the things in this article, and if you have questions, feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a>!</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> <em>If you‚Äôd like to pick up just one or two pieces of gear from this article then I‚Äôd recommend getting the <a href="https://youtu.be/5oXFCJi0TII">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Uberlite</a> and the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody</a>.

<p>Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic we‚Äôre all mostly <em>‚Äústuck at home‚Äù</em> in our countries - which isn‚Äôt a bad thing at all, as this allows us to go explore where we live and pay taxes! This pandemic also has brought a lot of people into the outdoors, and obviously the first thing you should familiarize yourself with are the <a href="https://lnt.org">Leave No Trace principles</a> so you don‚Äôt <em>accidentally</em> leave your trash and poo somewhere where it does not belong - don‚Äôt be one of those jerks who throws trash into nature. Now that we have these essential rules out of the way, let me show you the gear you need when you go backpacking. The idea is to help you <strong>save money and only get what you REALLY need</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quick Definition! Hiking: The activity of walking in nature, but sleeping indoors. Backpacking: The activity of walking AND sleeping outdoors in nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="clothes">Clothes</h2>

<p>The Easiest and most difficult point right at the start. The easiest because I firmly believe that most people can go hiking in their normal sports clothes on their first trips. If you have a synthetic/ wind-resistant pants or shorts for running or sports, chances are these are fine for your first backpacking trip. Some things to keep in mind, though:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don‚Äôt wear jeans when backpacking. They are too warm, too heavy, stay wet forever if it rains, and are mostly uncomfortable and restrict your movement.</li>
  <li>Except on the hottest 30¬∞C or more days, don‚Äôt wear cotton shirts. Like jeans, they need too long to dry and if it gets cool don‚Äôt keep you warm.</li>
  <li>Avoid heavy ‚Äúhiking‚Äù boots, use trailrunning or sport shoes with a good, grippy sole instead.</li>
  <li>Invest into some good socks and underwear for hiking!</li>
  <li>You can take a (fleece) jogging pants, a comfy shirt and possibly some woolen socks for camp along</li>
</ul>

<p>It is very easy to spend thousands of ¬£$‚Ç¨ on clothes for hiking, and completely unnecessary for a beginner. Some sports clothes or airy fabric trousers with good freedom of movement and maybe some wind resistance are fine, together with a synthetic or Merino wool T-shirt. Most people own a fleece jacket, which works fine for insulation on summer days, and most also own a rain jacket. If you really want to start to invest into clothes for backpacking I‚Äôd recommend getting a good pair of light trailrunning shoes. Now, you won‚Äôt be running, but these types of shoes are comfortable all day long, you are unlikely to get blisters in them, they have great grip on muddy, wet and slippery terrain and they also are light. Go on a few day hikes before you take them backpacking, to see if they work for you. In 99% of the cases, they do üòä!</p>

<p><em>A detailed article on garments for hiking and backpacking will follow this month, so stay tuned if this topic interests you!</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7807588712/in/album-72157630936718764/" title="You can&#x27;t climb mountains in trailrunners"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7131/7807588712_df00e66139_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="You can&#x27;t climb mountains in trailrunners" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And finally, under clothes - <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/swix-pro-trail-carbon-120-trekking-pole.html">trekking poles</a>. Some people swear on them for hiking, others are happy without them. I both like them when I need them - for example when fording rivers, hiking through swamps, and demanding terrain, and I also am happy without them. Hence I like Poles which fold up small and are light, so that when I carry them they fits nicely to the side of the pack. If trekking poles are for you - you might want to see for yourself and test some, maybe loan a pair from friends for a hike and see how you get on with them. However, if your shelter needs Poles - you probably will not get around using them!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7807416278" title="HMG Porter &amp; BD Z-Poles"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/8432/7807416278_d55bc283b3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="HMG Porter &amp; BD Z-Poles" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="kitchen--water">Kitchen &amp; Water</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs also easy to spend a few hundred ‚Ç¨$¬£ on the kitchen and water carrying stuff. For the start of your backpacking hobby, get a good water filter like the <a href="https://youtu.be/CneJY3F6zuY">Katadyn BeFree</a>. This filter is very easy to use, and while there sometimes are some durability issues with the flask the customer service from Katadyn is very good and quickly sends out replacement flasks. You might want to pick up a second light water bottle (I can recommend the <a href="https://cnocoutdoors.com/collections/vecto-family/products/2019-vecto-2l-28mm?variant=20550036357209">CNOC Vecto 2l</a>) if you hike in environments where there‚Äôs not a spring every few kilometres and for camp. I also always carry a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/10/kupilka-review.html">Kupilka Kuksa</a> - the bigger one is the ideal size to prepare TentMeals in, and also for a big cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998094941/in/photostream/" title="Water and drinking"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998094941_5880327b29_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Water and drinking" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I believe that gas stoves with a Piezo ignition are the most user-friendly for beginners and experts alike, and the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/primus-lite-gas-stove/?pid=10239">Primus Lite+ Stove</a> is the most affordable one in this segment. It is light, compact, available in a variety of nice colours and very easy to use. It works well for two people, and it is fast to bring water to a boil, too. Once you want to go backpacking more it is fine to do your research on <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/the-2nd-renaissance-of-esbit.html">other stoves</a>, but for beginners an easy and convenient to use gas stove is the best investment.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30287286992/in/album-72157675269849996/" title="Camp on the fourth morning"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/5680/30287286992_aeb90feb6a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Camp on the fourth morning" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="food--snacks">Food &amp; Snacks</h2>

<p>On a longer backpacking trip food and snacks will be the heaviest thing in your backpack. Food for a week weighs for me around 5 kg, give or take, and happily this gets lighter every day. I have a plant-based diet and it‚Äôs completely possible to have nutritious, tasty vegan backpacking meals every day for a week without that you feel like <em>‚ÄúUuuagh, again the same?!‚Äù</em>. If you eat everything, it gets even easier. My favourite vegan meals are from Tent Meals and my Patreons get a 25% discount on their orders, so it‚Äôs totally worth it to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">join my Patreon tribe</a> and save on these tasty meals. Also FirePot, LYO Food, Bl√•Band and REAL Turmat make good vegan backpacking meals, and as this is going to fuel your adventure, don‚Äôt save money on these. I made that mistake on my first backpacking trips, thinking that a normal ‚Äújust add water‚Äù meal from the Supermarket is just as good, and I <strong>a)</strong> didn‚Äôt feel like eating them after two days and <strong>b)</strong> they don‚Äôt deliver the same amount of calories than the specialized backpacking meals. It feels expensive to spend 7 to 10‚Ç¨ on one backpacking dinner, but it‚Äôs really worth it - and if you‚Äôd be in a city, you would easily spend more than that on a dinner!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/41423900054/in/dateposted/" title="Dinner!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/950/41423900054_46cce273b3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dinner!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As for Snacks, I am a huge fan of honey-roasted and chili nuts with some chocolate raisins thrown in for variety. I also know that especially the Nuts will make you hugely popular with fellow hikers, so take enough to last you and a friend through the trip :) I also consume the <a href="https://www.clifbar.com/products/clif/bloks-energy-chews/black-cherry">ClifBar Bloks</a> as they are excellent to get fast energy, are tasty, and really easy to use. I have tried normal ClifBars on various trips, but for me they simply are <em>‚Äútoo much‚Äù</em> and I prefer the Bloks + Nuts.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998095301/in/photostream/" title="Snacks"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998095301_6d1a8796db_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snacks" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Coffee, Tea and Hot Chocolate are my hot drinks staples when outdoors. I have a minimum of three <a href="https://www.naturata.de/bio-produkte/kaffee-kakao/espresso-kaffee-sticks-bohnenkaffee-instant-25g/">Naturata Espresso Sticks</a> per day with me, these are easier to source than the equally good Starbucks Via, then one or two bags of tea per day, and one bag of Hot chocolate per day, as my little treat before going to sleep. Other than that I drink water, water, water, just like home =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998346927/in/dateposted/" title="Tea, Coffee, Hot Chocolate"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998346927_3a6581e412_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tea, Coffee, Hot Chocolate" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="hygiene--first-aid">Hygiene &amp; First Aid</h2>

<p>Thanks to the Pandemic we all know that we should wash our hands, outdoors this is maybe even a tad more important as we usually touch stones, trees, roots, plants and dirt when we scramble up places or walk through nature. So a good bio-degradable soap (I recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/2URUK51">Dr. Bonners Mint</a>) needs to come along, as well as a small bottle of Disinfectant. You always should brush your teeth, so a tooth brush, some tooth silk or a tooth pick, and a bio-degradable toothpaste (I prefer <a href="https://amzn.to/3hf6aJz">Dent Tabs</a> by far) need to go into the Hygiene kit, and then anything else one might want or need (stuff for contact lenses for example). I also always carry a ClimbOn LipBalm as it is great to not get dry lips and also can be applied to mosquito bites or small cuts. If you are popular with Mosquitos, an insect repellant is good to take along, or you use a headnet and long clothes to keep them off. Similarly sunscreen is useful on hikes where there is no shade and you expect to hike in the sun. You don‚Äôt need to buy these things except maybe the soap and disinfectant - use on your first hikes the same things you have at home.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998094766/in/photostream/" title="My Hygine Kit"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998094766_6ca06ba24a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="My Hygine Kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My First Aid kit is absolut minimalist, there‚Äôs a small bottle of mint oil (it works great against headaches for me), a few painkillers and band-aids in there, and that is it. I also have here a small repair kit - some patches for my air mattress, some duct tape, a security needle and that‚Äôs that. If I <strong>really</strong> need medical attention I prefer to call for help instead of trying to patch myself up with some surgical dressings which you find in the 1st Aid kits you can buy everywhere. And as in my Hygiene and First Air Kit I also have a <em>‚Äúlarge‚Äù</em> towel I can use that as a bandage if I feel I can take care of myself. Speaking of the towel, I long thought I don‚Äôt need it, but it has proven to be something that is multi-functional and hence comes along again: I can dry myself after a dip in a river or lake, wipe the dew from my shelter in the morning, hold a hot pot with it or, as above, use it as a band-aid üòÉ</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49997574068/in/photostream/" title="FA Kit"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49997574068_231c047b73_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="FA Kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="backpack">Backpack</h2>

<p>Now actually I‚Äôd put the backpack as the latest item you buy, but as this item sits totally in-between day hiking and backpacking I feel I can not talk about it at the end. However, I recommend getting this as the last item if possible, simply as it means you can purchase one which fits all the gear and food which you will have for your backpacking trips. Backpacks are a difficult topic and what works for one person does not necessarily work for another one. If you have a small, local outdoor shop go visit them, but don‚Äôt let them sell you the most expensive or heavy backpack. Osprey and Gregory are two brands which make nowadays good lightweight backpacks with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/01/osprey-levity-45-review.html">Exos</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/11/osprey-exos-48-review.html">Levity</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/gregory-optic-48.html">Optic</a> (women models are available for these, too!) and these are the models you should ask for in your shop. A backpack which has around 50 l is a good volume to aim for, with some careful packing it is good for all the gear a backpacking beginner takes along, plus the food, and this size pack also still works fine for day hikes as you can compress them nicely.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49997573963/in/photostream/" title="Packs!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49997573963_f4ee567bc6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Packs!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now real ultralight backpacking brands like <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de">HUCKEPACKS</a>, Sierra Designs, Six Moon Designs and Gossamer Gear, to name just a few, are pretty much only available online. If you want, it is totally worth it to purchase one of their backpacks, though you‚Äôll need to measure your back length, make decisions on materials and features you want, which is already quite a bit of research - of course you just can <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">read my reviews</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hendrikmorkel">watch my videos</a> to do that research, and buy accordingly üòÉ But again, I believe that a beginner should visit a independent, local gear shop and ask for one of these backpacks mentioned above, and try if they work for her or him. So far 100% of the people who got one of these packs after my recommendation are really happy with them, which is why I feel confident in recommending them (they are great packs, too!). If you then decide to pursue backpacking as a hobby you can get one of the lighter packs from the cottage brands!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44199759745/in/album-72157702073100795/" title="Stor√•d√∂rren Valley from the other side n better weather"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1903/44199759745_b4b7e1753e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Stor√•d√∂rren Valley from the other side n better weather" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="shelter">Shelter</h2>

<p>While a backpack usually doesn‚Äôt cost more than 200‚Ç¨ with the shelter and sleep system we get into an area where things get pricey. My recommendations here are to get good quality kit which does not break the bank for a beginner, if one wants to go backpacking more there‚Äôs always the option to get something different. I think most people want something which keeps bugs out (as them  üï∑ ü¶Ç are out in force in the summer). The <a href="https://www.tarptent.com/product/double-rainbow/">Double Rainbow from Tarptent</a> is a proven design at a really good price. A tent with a similar construction, slightly heavier but way easier to get in Europe and elsewhere, is the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/msr-elixir-2-2-man-tent/?pid=10239">MSR Elixir 2</a>. If your budget is a bit higher then the <a href="https://www.outdoorline.sk/en/tents/big-agnes-fly-creek-hv-ul2-ultralight-tent">Big Agnes Fly Creek HV UL2</a> or the <a href="https://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/equipment-c3/tents-shelters-c25/two-person-tents-c26/lunar-duo-explorer-2p-tent-p3325">Six Moon Designs Lunar Duo Explorer 2P Tent</a> are very good picks.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49997180938/in/dateposted/" title="Camp"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49997180938_ed7115939b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Camp" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I myself really like to sleep under a Tarp or in a Pyramide-style shelter. The <a href="https://locusgear.com/items/hapi-sil/?lang=en">Locus Gear Hapi Sil</a> is an amazing Pyramide tent, the <a href="https://www.gossamergear.com/collections/shelters-sleeping-pads/products/twinn-tarp">Gossamer Gear Twinn Tarp</a> is an absolute Classic which is easy to pitch and has a lot of dry space under it, and the <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/millaris-bivy-sack/">As Tucas Millaris Bivy Sack</a> works with either of these shelters or on it‚Äôs own if the sky is clear!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/38085020741/in/dateposted/" title="Locus Gear Hapi Sil in the morning"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4469/38085020741_56f5f2ece7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Locus Gear Hapi Sil in the morning" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If you go backpacking in Finland, Sweden or Norway you also might be able to not take a shelter at all, as you could sleep simply in one of the hundreds of free, open Wilderness Huts. The problem which might arise is that the hut is full and you can‚Äôt sleep there, so having a shelter along is always recommended. There are Huts in Finland which you can reserve, so the <em>‚ÄúThe Hut is full‚Äù</em> Problem won‚Äôt arise. And while these huts are AMAZING I do like to sleep outside, hear the birds chirp and the wind blow through the leafs. Plus you won‚Äôt be awoken by other hut inhabitants when they leave at 5:00 o‚Äôclock.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37340978576/in/dateposted/" title="Str√∂mskojan Inside"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4435/37340978576_f69dcfda81_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Str√∂mskojan Inside" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sleep-system">Sleep System</h2>

<p>Your sleep system consists of a sleeping pad, a quilt or sleeping bag and possibly a pillow (I use a insulation jacket and fold it into a pillow). The <a href="https://youtu.be/5oXFCJi0TII">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Uberlite</a> is an outstanding mattress, but maybe beginners are a bit better off with getting a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite.html">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite</a> as it is more durable and cheaper while still being light and compact. If you like to sleep on a hard underground, then the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/exped-flexmat-plus-sleeping-mat/?pid=10239">Exped Flexmat Plus</a> is a great pick as it can not break and at 40‚Ç¨ it is really cheap, while being very comfortable.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998095396/in/photostream/" title="Sleeping well"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998095396_73cbece14b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sleeping well" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At home you sleep under a duvet, and outdoors the next best thing is a quilt. I really like my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/as-tucas-sestrals-quilt.html">As Tucas Sestrals Quilt</a>, also the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/enlightened-equipment-revelation-quilts.html">enLIGHTened Equipment Revelation Quilts</a> are a very good pick, and if money is no issue I suggest getting a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/01/katabatic-gear-sawatch-quilt.html">Katabatic Gear Quilt</a>. If social and sustainable issues are important to you, have a look at the good <a href="http://tidd.ly/3d3b83f5">Vaude Alpstein 450</a>, which is a really good quilt. Again, there‚Äôs a lot of options here, but amongst those which I mentioned you can find something which suits your budget and needs!</p>

<h2 id="navigation-maps-and-extras">Navigation, Maps and Extras</h2>

<p>The final point on my list is about the small items which are needed to not get lost and to remember. A map and compass are pretty useful when going into nature, and I recommend for the first few trips that you stay on trails and use the map to get safely from A to B. Also an App like <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/383480947">HikePack</a> is very good to navigate (and there‚Äôs a free version!), and might be easier to use than a compass and map for beginners (despite this, the latter are important skills to learn and master!). I also carry a small <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/expedition">Field Notes Brand notebook</a> + pen with me, and obviously a camera. Unless you‚Äôre already a photographer and own a good camera, just use your phone for photos. If this is an aspect you‚Äôd like to pursue more passionately at some point, feel free to hit me up on Twitter and ask me about camera recommendations! Finally, a headlamp like the <a href="http://tidd.ly/d33332f9">Petzl Bindi</a> is good to have along if you need to get out at night or if you get up early/ stay up late. Here in the North it‚Äôs something you not necessarily need in the summer, as it doesn‚Äôt really get dark.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The best thing is if you simply could ask a good friend (like me, right Tumppi ;) who totally is into outdoor stuff and has a bunch of gear to kit you out for your first backpacking trip. That way you can see what works for you and don‚Äôt need to make purchases which may work well for you. But not everyone has that friend, so the next best thing is to do your research online, learn from other people‚Äôs mistakes and experience, and buy the right gear from the start (this does involve trusting these friends, and not deciding to throw away all the recommendations and simply buy what you think is best, just to realize after some use that the knowledgable friend actually was right all along‚Ä¶). To make checking the gear you have &amp; need easier I made <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bjsgcr5KmPblSjvjvQs3To6iCU7LYqNBczFazSJNX80/edit?usp=sharing">this Checklist</a> which you can copy &amp; paste or print out. With the list in your hands you make sure you don‚Äôt waste money on kit which you don‚Äôt need, and my tips here hopefully help you figure out which gear is worth getting. The most important thing, however, is to enjoy being outdoors.</p>

<p>Backpacking in nature is the single best way to connect to the natural environment, learn to appreciate it and see why it is so important to protect wild places. For us humans going into nature has a tremendously positive effect on our mental health, creativity and also our physical health, as several scientific articles have highlights in the past couple of years. And the whole experience of backpacking gets more enjoyable &amp; fun the less unnecessary &amp; heavy equipment we carry along while outdoors. With this article read you now know what gear you need for your first backpacking trip, and I hope it will be a most memorable one!
