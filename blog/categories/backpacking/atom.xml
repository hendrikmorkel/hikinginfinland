<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>Simple to pitch, spacious for one, and good for dry environments where you will encounter a lot of bugs, that’s where the <a href="http://bit.ly/2YQRTZD">Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2</a> shines as an ultralight shelter. In humid and wet environments, if you’re tall or you hike with a friend then you might not find this shelter the best option.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I received the Dirigo 2 in the spring of 2019 and slept in it a dozen nights in Finland and Germany.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48753207373/in/album-72157710871736107/" title="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48753207373_825a024484_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The function of this tent is to keep you protected from bugs, critters and rain when you are sleeping outdoors. It’s a hybrid single + double wall design which pitches with two trekking poles and has two entries and vestibules.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>In the last couple of years I have felt there haven’t been that much innovations in backpacking. This time I’d say the use of breathable DCF-WPB (that’s the breathable Cuben material, the same which is used in The Shell) is an innovation, although I’m not totally convinced that the small panels are enough or at the right place. Also, other companies already have used breathable cuben (with eVent) for several years in shelters.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48753274923/in/dateposted/" title="Breathable Side Panel of the Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48753274923_94371a0d71_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Breathable Side Panel of the Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>I found the quality of the Dirigo 2 excellent. High-quality materials assembled by precise craftsmen &amp; women in Maine - yes, this is a “Made in the USA” product that is superbly crafted and deserves this label.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48753529646/in/album-72157710871736107/" title="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48753529646_2af71a3486_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The weight of my <a href="http://bit.ly/2YQRTZD">Dirigo 2</a> was 802 g, that includes all guylines. The included Drawstring Stuff Sack is 13 g, while the stake set with 8 Easton Stakes is 114 g or ~14 g per stake. So everything together is 929 g for this shelter.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48753723652/in/album-72157710871736107/" title="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48753723652_4d2054ecc6_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>As I was just writing about weight, you’ll need to also think about the weight of your Poles, though these do not count directly to the weight of the shelter. I use Ruta Locura Yana Poles (together with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-ultra-distance-trekking-poles.html">Black Diamond Ultra Distance Poles</a> probably my favourite trekking poles) which are 106 g per Pole. As I also use these throughout the day and do not carry them they aren’t included in the weight of the shelter, but obviously are needed. And as you read above, I use the <a href="http://bit.ly/30vnBf2">Hyperlite Mountain Gear Stake Kit</a>, and those are heavy. You could use much lighter Titanium pegs which are 5 g or less, then your stake set of 8 would be 40 g - quite a saving. However, I trust the Hyperlite Mountain Gear Stakes more in soft, wet ground and high winds, so I rather carry these instead of having some pegs pulled out by the wind.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48753722837/in/album-72157710871736107/" title="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48753722837_a371cb3886_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now at 802 g the Dirigo 2 is lightweight, but there are lighter alternatives - especially for two persons. The <a href="http://bit.ly/30yZUm5">Ultamid 2</a> from Hyperlite Mountain Gear themselves is 534 g but does not include a bug netting (that would be 418 g extra if you take their own) or ground sheet. Personally I take a bivy with the Ultamid 2 as it adds to the flexibility of the shelter (I only have to pitch it when I know it will rain, and can sleep with just the bivy when the stars are out). Competitors like Big Agnes have the <a href="http://bit.ly/2IfqJpd">Scout 2</a> out, which in the Platinum Version weighs around 500 g - but also has no vestibule or dual entry. From the cottages both the StratoSpire Li from Tarptent and the ZPacks Duplex are of similar construction, weight and price.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48759613841/in/dateposted/" title="Packed Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48759613841_1ea25a9d4b_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Packed Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Dirigo 2 has a good interior height, this is achieved by the two trekking poles and the short carbon strut at the peak which creates more inside space. The trekking poles are angled and go into a grommet at the bottom and into a small reinforced pocket at the peak, this makes for a solid frame in high winds when the doors are closed. If you open the doors and roll them up you can enjoy great views, though this weakens the tent in high winds quite a bit. However, in reality you only will roll up the doors when the weather is good, so it really is a non-issue. Also on the inside is a small mesh pocket, I have used this for my headlamp to illuminate the tent and that has worked well. I really like the high roof and comfortable sitting height.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48744202071/in/album-72157710871736107/" title="Hammastunturi Wilderness"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48744202071_6e6180c9f3_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Hammastunturi Wilderness" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>OK, for where is this tent made? It has a groundsheet (= GREAT for very wet environments) and No-See-Um mesh walls which keep the Bugs out (GREAT against mosquitos, ticks, deer flies and other critters and insects). However, in wet environments condensation is an issue and so I feel the Dirigo 2 is much better suited for trips in dry and bug-infested environments. If you mostly go backpacking in the spring and summer and encounter at your camp spots lots of bugs, this is a great choice. If you’re out year around, often in wet conditions, then this might not be the best option for you (then the <a href="http://bit.ly/30yZUm5">Ultamid 2</a> should be your choice).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48753208173/in/album-72157710871736107/" title="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48753208173_b6624a2071_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Something I also really liked about the tent was how easy it is to pitch. Spread it out in a square, peg out the corners, enter the trekking poles and adjust their height, peg out the doors and then the side panels and <em>Voilá!</em> you’re done. After some practice you’re able to pitch this tent in two to three minutes, and thanks to it’s design the inside will mostly stay dry if you pitch in the rain. Putting the tent down is equally simple, I like to fold it up once from each long side to the middle and then once in the middle, this lets me squeeze out any trapped air easily and I can roll up the Dirigo 2 into a small package. Attention only has to be paid to the carbon fibre strut and that it stays where it’s supposed to be, as sometimes it slips out and needs to be put back into place when you’re setting up the tent. The Dirigo 2 can be set up higher or lower depending on how much airflow you wish or how much drafts you want to avoid. I had no problems with drafts even when the outer was pitched 10 cm or more high, by choosing not completely exposed sites.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48744192771/in/album-72157710871736107/" title="Hammastunturi Wilderness"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48744192771_6544ae0676_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Hammastunturi Wilderness" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then there’s the packed size. I was surprised by how large the tent is packed, and had to carry it usually in my front mesh pocket (which was the best choice after rainy nights). It packs, even when dry, fairly big, and I often found the included Drawstring bag too small for it - though as I usually just stuffed the rolled-up tent into the front pocket, this was not a problem.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48759804762/in/album-72157710871736107/" title="Packed Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48759804762_45bc9adae5_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Packed Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I do think the Dirigo 2 could do with more interior space to make it less cramped for two people. Right now it is a solid 1-Person tent, though I would not use it with another adult. I also wonder why the Breathable Cuben was only used in the lower parts of the design, and not also at the top or over the whole side panel (it’s probably a cost thing). This would likely help to minimize or even eliminate the condensation issue. Also, while not really an issue for me, I do think the Dirigo 2 doors would benefit from a buckle at the bottom of the zipper which takes the stress of the zipper, that would make the zippers survive longer and also allow you to open the zipper while keeping the structural integrity more solid I imagine.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>Are you mostly out in the summer, like to camp above the treeline, do encounter lots of bugs, like to have a groundsheet and generally a fully enclosed shelter? Then the <a href="http://bit.ly/2YQRTZD">Hyperlite Mountain Gear Dirigo 2</a> is a good choice for you. It is excellently made, spacious for one, durable and sheds wind very well, while keeping the bugs and rain out. It is simple and easy to use, and does it’s job of protecting you from rain and bugs very well. All that does come at a price, as at $795 you almost pay $1 per gram of shelter. If you’re usually out with friends in wet and humid environments then you might be better off to use a modular setup with more space, something like the <a href="http://bit.ly/30yZUm5">Ultamid 2</a> or one of the many other pyramid designs out there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you want to spend an active week of holidays in Scandinavia, Åre is the place to go: Kayaking, trailrunning, hiking, kite surfing and downhill biking are just some of the activities you can do in this wonderful little village in Western Sweden. In the autumn the village is especially pretty, as the hills with their bilberry shrubs turn red and the birches add their golden leafs for that wonderful relaxing autumn feel!</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-re-sweden">Getting to Åre, Sweden</h2>

<p>As sustainability grows more and more important to me I find it harder and harder to book a flight. While you can fly to Åre I have a <a href="https://www.wasaline.com">ferry</a> in my town, that allows me to be very quickly in Umeå, Sweden. From there I can hop on a <a href="https://www.sj.se">train</a> and be in six hours in Åre, arriving right in the centre of the village. This is a very affordable and relaxing way to travel for me, as I can watch my favourite Youtube channels, read books, plot down ideas for articles and of course study the map for my upcoming backpacking trip in Vålådalen! From Finland you can also leave from Helsinki and Turku with the <a href="https://www.tallinksilja.fi">ferry to Stockholm</a>, and then take the sleeper train to Åre - allowing you to arrive well-rested in the morning and start your day in the active outdoor capital of Sweden!</p>

<h2 id="learning-downhill-biking-at-scandinavias-largest-bike-park">Learning Downhill Biking at Scandinavia’s largest Bike Park</h2>

<p>“<em>Are you Hendrik?</em>” my Guide Jesper asked me when I entered the Skistar Shop on the Main-square of Åre. “Yes, and I’m here to learn downhill biking. And I’m afraid.” “<em>That’s good!</em>” Jesper replied, and from then on I knew I was in good hands. Odin helped me get dressed in my “full-body harness” as I referred to it, a combination of a chest and back protector, hand and elbow protectors, shin and knee protectors and of course a helmet and googles. “<em>Have you ever sat on a Full-Suspension Bike?</em>” Jesper asked me when I was dressed. “No” I replied. “<em>No Problem, I’ll teach you everything there is to know about Downhill biking, from braking, getting up the mountain with the lift and safely getting down!</em>”</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/45002158152/in/dateposted/" title="Downhill Bikes are fun!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1966/45002158152_acf8fcdc3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Downhill Bikes are fun!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<em>Have you ever sat on a Full-Suspension Bike?</em>” Jesper asked me when I was dressed. “No” I replied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After I got my full-suspension bike we headed out and up towards the lift, where we stopped on a flat space and Jesper gave me the instructions I needed to get down the mountain, from the position of my feet (parallel to the ground), how to brake (with both brakes at the same time) and where to look while riding (as far ahead as possible). Then I needed to demonstrate what I was just told, and after a couple of circles Jesper decided I was ready to hit the tracks. A short instruction on how to put the bike into the chair lift followed, though attentive staff also was on hand and ready to help in case I’d mess up (I didn’t 😊).</p>

<p>On the top of the hill it was just as easy to get the bike out and walk away, and then we were ready to drop in. “I’m still afraid” I mentioned to Jesper, upon seeing the tracks and how &amp; with what speed other bikers where racing them down. “<em>You’ll be fine. We take this slow, just brake a little all the time and you’ll just do what we talked about earlier.</em>” Jesper calmed me down, and to make it a wee bit easier we also skipped the first part of the track on this first run, and went in a wee bit further down the hill.</p>

<p>Well, it went really just as fine as Jesper said. Maybe my experience of riding bike every day, bikepacking and riding on local trails had given me a good foundation and idea on how to ride downhill, but soon I was whooping as I took a curve high and fast or racing over the narrow trails. Yes, I was braking and definitely not as fast and good as many others riding in <a href="https://aresweden.com/en/are-bike-park/">Åre Bike Park</a>, but damn did it feel good to turn that fear into confidence, joy and hollers as I was riding down Åreskutan!</p>

<p>That first day we were two and half hours out in the Bike Park, and I not only got to see the best view over Åre, but I also got to ride many different trails - from the Beginner-friendly Serpentinen to the gorgeously scenic Organic. I really was overjoyed about the experience, and even if I didn’t master the jumps very well (taking off to early, with too much speed or not landing right) it was an amazing afternoon!</p>

<p>The next day - because all good things come in pairs! - I headed back in the morning to the Ski Star Shop, and with some luck &amp; good timing Jesper and me were the first people on the lift up. There’s several chair lifts which bring bikers up the mountain, as well as the cable car, though sadly it was too windy and so the latter was grounded. That meant we wouldn’t be able to ride from the top as Jesper had planned, but he had some great trails for me to ride nevertheless. I asked if it’d be OK to ride down Serpentinen again as the first ride, so I can “<em>get back into the groove on familiar terrain</em>” and that was just what Jesper had planned.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31177213698/in/dateposted/" title="Åre Bike Park and Åresjön"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1970/31177213698_ecf52e3eb1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Åre Bike Park and Åresjön" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then we took another lift up, rode to the other side of the mountain and enjoyed another scenic trail which brought us back down to Åre. Back up Jesper decided I was ready to ride Shimano, Åre’s most famous red trail. Shortly my fear flickered back up, but with some confidence inspiring words from Jesper I dropped in. Shimano has some 50 or so jumps (and I rolled over at least 40 or so of them 😬🤣) and 20 fat bank curves where you almost ride parallel to the ground, and it’s a trail which had me hollering quite a bit when I mastered a curve or a jump! After Shimano we had a small Fika in town, and then hit the trails a few more times before it was time for me drop off my gear and bike, say many thank yous to Jesper and leave the shop with a big, fat smile!</p>

<p>Downhill biking thus. It is strangely relaxing to ride down that narrow trail, always looking far ahead, not going too slow so you can take that curve as high as possible, and also trying to taking in that amazing scenery. You life in the present, things which you had on your mind while walking to the lift - remember that fear from the beginning? - are pushed aside, to be pondered about at another time, if ever again. The focus is on the trail in front of you, and when you arrive down at the lift station - a big smile and the excitement of that adrenaline rush leaving your brain. It’s addicting, and after years of wondering what people find in this “dangerous sport”, I know: Focus, relaxation and joy.</p>

<p>(<em>And while I feel that I already have enough hobbies, I think I need to etch out some time to go more downhill biking. And maybe I need to visit the <a href="http://arebikefestival.com">Åre Bike Festival</a> in 2019!</em>)</p>

<h2 id="trailrunning-to-totthummeln">Trailrunning to Totthummeln</h2>

<p>Since the summer I am <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning</a> several times a week at home. Now, as some of you know, I life at the coast in Finland. Unlike, for example, the Norwegian coast, the Finnish coast is pretty similar to the Dutch coast. Which means it’s prettttttty flat over here. And while I run up and down several “hills” every week, these 15, 20 m of elevation did not really make me ready to run in the mountains. That’s the realization I came to when I was running with Björn up to Totthummeln, a scenic hill with a great view which lays between Åre and Björnen. We started from Granen, the Hotel I stayed at, and after a few hundred meters of asphalt we soon hit the Trollstigen Trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44138672535/in/dateposted/" title="Trailrunning on Totthummeln"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1909/44138672535_55bcb74c1a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Trailrunning on Totthummeln" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>From then on it were sweet trails that took us around the mountain, with great views over Åre, the lake and Björnen, and then up to the top of Totthummeln. Björn’s personal best time around the mountain is 35 minutes, though with my help and the visit to the summit we made it in double the time back to my Hotel… Nevertheless, it was a great run, despite the rain, and if you don’t want to run to this easy summit - you always can make it a nice day hike with the family &amp; kids!</p>

<h2 id="hiking-on-reskutan">Hiking on Åreskutan</h2>

<p>Before trailrunning with Björn I was out on my own in the morning, exploring the hiking trails of Åreskutan. There are over half a dozen trails which go up, around and across the mountain, and if you’re looking for a fun day hike - Åreskutan will not disappoint. Yes, you will cross the ski slopes once in a while, but most of the time you’ll be hiking in pretty forests on nice trails. There’s Cafés where you can enjoy a warm cup of coffee and a Kanelbullar, and if you don’t want to hike down you always can take one of the lifts back to the village. If the weather is good I can imagine that the hiking is very nice, and especially the Trollstigen Trail with it’s hidden treasures and wood nymphs is great for kids (it’s also only about a kilometre long, so also doable for 3 year olds!).</p>

<h2 id="exploring-the-village">Exploring the village</h2>

<p>After all that hiking, running and cycling I was hungry. Already before I left to Åre I heard about the <a href="http://www.creperielogi.se/are/">Åre Crêperie &amp; logi</a>, and the place did not disappoint! It was very cozy with super-friendly staff, and the Vegan Crêpes were amazing &amp; soooooo tasty. I also went and had coffee at the <a href="http://arekafferosteri.se/">Åre Kafferosteri</a> which roast their own coffee - definitely a recommndation. As a Houdini Friend I also of course had to check out the <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/se/vara-butiker?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzMDAhcXn3QIV7p3tCh2bEAokEAAYASAAEgK1s_D_BwE">Houdini Store Åre</a>, though I also went to see the Shops of Peak Performance (which was founded in Åre in 1986!), Stellar Equipment and Haglöfs! Besides these stores you’ll find a couple other sports stores, and plenty of Cafés and Bars to spend the afternoons and evenings.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-stay">Where to stay</h2>

<p>There’s over <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=-2468311&amp;aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">30 Hotels and B&amp;Bs in Åre</a>, so there’s something for each wallet. I stayed my first two nights at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/se/hotell-granen.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Hotell Granen</a> which is a wee bit up the hill and offered a scenic view. The Hotel had an amazing breakfast, was super-beautifully decorated (I would have wished I’d had more time to just lounge in the comfy chairs by the fire place and read or drink a 🥃 in the bar) and not even three minutes on foot and one was in the centre of Åre!</p>

<p>My last night in Åre I slept and dined at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/se/holiday-club-are.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Holiday Club Åre</a> which was equally impressive. This is a Holiday Club Hotel unlike any other I have seen - it’s modern, stylish and in the middle of town -  you get to the railway station via a bridge! The Holiday Club Åre has a Spa and Swimming Pool, and also is a popular Lunch place for the locals. I had twice a very delicious lunch here, and the Vegan 3-Course dinner was outstanding and so much that I couldn’t even finish my dessert! The room was very nice, I was sitting on the terrace in the sun and enjoying the view over the lake and town and a bit sad I had to leave so soon again.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping it up</h2>

<p>A holiday in Åre can be many things: Exciting, relaxing, and tasty. I so much enjoyed my days in this small ski town, which unlike many other ski towns in the Alps or Northern Europe is open year-round. That’s right - Åre’s shops &amp; hotels are open almost the whole year, and the <a href="https://www.skistar.com/en/ski-destinations/are/">cable cars and lifts</a> run in the winter, spring, summer and autumn: In the winter they bring skiers and snowboarders up the slopes, while from spring till autumn it are hikers and downhill bikers who take a ride up to Åreskutan. Add in its proximity to several beautiful nature places like Vålådalen and just a short trip to Norway, and like me, you probably soon will fall in love with the authentic vibe of this small town &amp; its friendly people and you’ll wonder: When can I come back?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ask a Swede about Åre and they will know: This is the place to be in the summer for Downhill biking, hiking, kayaking and many more outdoor activities, while in the winter this small village with it’s cozy Cafés, outdoor shops and restaurants becomes a bit bigger as people come to ski on Åreskutan and the surrounding mountains. I spent the last week in Åre and Vålådalen enjoying the Swedish nature &amp; hospitality - here is what you can expect!</p>

<p>I travelled via Ferry and train to Åre, which is very easy but it takes some time. A good book, your favourite Youtube show and naps will make the time go by fast, and before you know it you’ll be in Åre, not far away from the border with Norway. You’ll get the full information on how to get there, where to stay and what to eat soon, for the moment just enjoy these images and short tidbits about my autumn week in Åre and Vålådalen 🍂</p>

<p>On my first day in Åre I went hiking, trailrunning and explored the little village. Even in the off-season that is now there were plenty of people out on the mountain and in the village, and after some rain throughout the day it cleared up and became a nice evening with a spectacular sunset.</p>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/06/the-ul-fellowship.html">Eight years ago I have been in Vålådalen</a> (<em>and go read that article it’s still AMAZING!</em>) and I was excited to go back. Heck, to be honest, I want to go back there right now. The autumn colours were on point, the bilberries sweet and big, and the scenery just sublime. A detailed article only about the backpacking trip comes soon so stay tuned for that, too.</p>

<p>After 92 amazing kilometres of backpacking it was back to Åre and doing something which I have never done before: Downhill Mountain Biking. A sport I had &amp; still have a massive amount respect for, and was scared of. But with my Guide Jesper I became confident and had so much fun ripping down the trails, taking these high turns, learning to jump (still learning 😂) and feeling confident on these narrow trails. Wow, that was soooo good.</p>

<h2 id="hello-sweden">Hello Sweden!</h2>

<p>It’s one o’clock as I cycle over to the ferry harbour in Vaasa, lock my bike and check in. Before me are four hours of ferry boredom but happily it’s much cheaper and more environmentally friendly to take the boat than to fly first to Stockholm and then to Umeå. Besides, Umeå is the closest city to Vaasa if one wouldn’t take the Baltic in account! I spend my time on the boat reading a book on the Kindle App and watching Youtube Videos while drinking coffee and enjoying a tasty Pulla in the Café. Then, finally, we start to see the first islands and it ain’t too long until we arrive at the harbour in Umeå. Usually I’d would have to take a Bus and then another Bus to get where I need to go, but I’m lucky as Elisabeth from the Bjurholm kommun was in town and can give me a ride to Agnäs, where I will spend the first night as a guest of <a href="http://agnasstugby.se">Agnäs Stugor</a>.</p>

<p>I have a own cozy cottage where I roll out my quilt, boil some water and eat one of the meals I brought, along with an Astronaut ice cream - because the sooner that food bag gets lighter and smaller, the better! As I lounge around on the sofa I realize I forgot to bring my Powerbank, which isn’t a smart move - I need it to keep the phone charged as I need it for flying my <a href="http://amzn.to/2hu4iPU">drone</a>. Ah well, I’ll make it work, I think, and then head to sleep after a final hot shower.</p>

<h2 id="rtrsk-to-nsland">Örträsk to Näsland</h2>

<p>It’s a misty morning as my alarm rings at 6:30 am and I get up. I boil hot water in the kitchen for coffee and Müsli, pack up my backpack and then am waiting outside for Claudia, who works for the Bjurholm Community and will drop me off at the start of the trail as she has business in that direction that morning either way. It’s a perk to not needing to stand and wait for a bus up North, which makes the whole logistics part a wee bit easier. I drop off the key to my cottage, say bye to the sheep and then promptly Claudia arrives and we start the ride to Örträsk.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37340950796/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Morning sky"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4401/37340950796_f8e5fa74cc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Morning sky" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The road is very scenic and sometimes I’m almost asking her to stop the car so I could take some photos, but then I re-consider and just let her drive. After some 45 minutes we take a turn and I already see the Öreälven river. A minute later she backs up into a small road and tell’s me <em>“We are here!”</em>. The sky is grey and I much rather would be sitting in a warm car or Café, but hey - lets get started!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37340952986/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Start of the trail"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4482/37340952986_f8d2a6583d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Start of the trail" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37305380575/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Start of the trail!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4441/37305380575_55f457cb81_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Start of the trail!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The sign shows the way, and up here in the Bjurholm community the trail is superbly marked - sometimes every tree has a red or orange dot! I walk two minutes along the gravel road, and that were exactly the two minutes my shoes were dry on the trail: I make a turn down to the river and after six steps through the high grass my shoes are soaking wet.</p>

<p>And then I see the river, and a not that silent <em>DAMN!</em> leaves my mouth: In a last minute decision the previous day I decided to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BY83wAtBy9S/?taken-by=hendrikm">not take my packraft</a>, a decision which I highly regret that moment standing in front of this river. Swiftly it floats past by me, and I picture myself sitting in my packraft and just leisurely floating the river down. Alas, packraft and paddle are at home and I’ll need to use my two feet to get to the Baltic.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37388438031/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Old Flating Dam south of Örträsk"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4466/37388438031_8e13568663_b.jpg" width="1024" height="767" alt="Old Flating Dam south of Örträsk" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A couple of minutes later I arrive at the Floaters Dam, and the small hut besides the river is inviting with it’s beds and table by the window. But as I plan to walk around 30 km each day it’d be a bit pre-mature to call it a day after one kilometre, and so I shoulder my backpack and enter the wild forest along the Öreälv river. And wild it is: The narrow path is never far away from the river, which runs next to me. Sometimes I need to back-track because parts of the trail are so deep under water that I rather look for a dry way around it than trying to jump over it, other times the trail is climbing high up a steep shoulder of a ridge and should one lose the footing one might end up with very wet pants, standing in the river. These sections will not present any problems for an experienced backpacker with a light backpack, though if you haul 20+ kg through the forest on your second or third trip you might feel like you’ve been presented a real challenge.</p>

<p>As it is autumn - <em>PRIME AUTUMN</em>, to be correct - the Mushrooms are in abundance along the trail. Small, big, colourful or inconspicuous, edible and poisonous - there’s so many of them that at some point I gave up to document them all.</p>

<p>And then something unexpected happens: The sky clears up and the sun shows up. I rejoice, shed the hardshell and enjoy the golden light finding it’s way through the leaves of the birches whose leafs try to match the colour of the sun. The blue sky appears over me and the green, yellow and orange forest, while the dark river continues to flow never-ending towards the Baltic. <em>“Ah, if I’d just had my packraft along!”</em> is a thought I more than once utter that day. I pass smaller rapids and the most lovely little cottages and simple lean-to shelters. Water for drinking is never far away - just hold the <a href="http://bit.ly/2h29SMs">Katadyn BeFree</a> into the river, screw on the lid and drink!</p>

<p>I hike at a for me slow 3 km/h and at around 17:00 o’clock reach the Näslandsforsen Hut, a lovely cabin with a green roof, not far from the river, plenty of wood and a large sleeping platform. While I planned to sleep at the Mariebäck Hut I decide to stay here, and quickly set up my camp, collect water, carry in wood and clean up the mess others had left before me. As night starts to fall I light the fire, lay on my mat and <a href="https://youtu.be/4jBr_W4iGi4">eat a Trek’N Eat Meal</a>. With a full belly and some 23 km covered it doesn’t take long for me to fall asleep in my warm cabin that night.</p>

<h2 id="nslandsforsen-to-storforsen">Näslandsforsen to Storforsen</h2>

<p>The next morning I wake up before dawn, light a little fire to get the cabin warm and boil the water I got the previous evening. Laying under my Quilt I drink a coffee and eat a Müsli, pondering how to structure my day and where to sleep tonight. As my phone’s battery is still quite good at some 70% full I decide to hike this morning into Bjurholm, have coffee and a Kanelbullar while charging the phone back to 100%. The black &amp; white map I have gives little infos about distance, though I reckon it shouldn’t be more than 8 km to the town.</p>

<p>The morning starts with a blue sky but quickly clouds start to race through the sky. The trail is lovely again, just like the previous day it is very well marked with plenty of trail blazes. Well before 11 o’clock I walk into town and find a Café where I can charge the phone, while studying the map and drinking coffee. After an hour the phone is charged and I set off out of town again. Even if I saw the trail sign I dully ignored it and just hiked down to the river, just to realize after a while that I lost the trail. Happily I found a dirt road which led into the right direction, and after some time of uncertainty I reach the trail again. At Lagnäset there’s a hanging bridge - though sadly it is closed. Claudia from the Bjurhom kummun later told me that there will be a new bridge coming in the future.</p>

<p>I follow the sign and soon hike up a slope which is like a yellow-golden tunnel of Birch-and-Rowan-Awesomeness. I utterly love the colourful forest around me and the kilometres go by just easily. I pass several huts and rest places to which roads lead, but the only person I saw that day was a woman picking berries just outside of Bjurholm. At Petnäset the river makes one of the most beautiful curves, something I tried to capture with my drone, but alas the high wind didn’t allow me to capture the frame I had in mind. Still, the underneath photo should give you an idea of how pretty it is!</p>

<p>The scenery now starts to get more civilized, just as the river. While the day before it ran through deep gorges and I felt at times like I’d be in Lapland or Alaska today the meandering curves and the closeness to fields make it feel closer to civilization. It’s a gradual and nice change, and I enjoy this new scenery. After the Petnäset Hut the river makes lots of curves, and a look on my watch tells me that I already have hiked close to 30 km.</p>

<p>As I’m hiking along the river on along a fine trail at once a small Elk arrives. It stands there, taking a good look at me and lets me take its photo, and then turns back into the forest where I also hear its mother. It’s a beautiful experience and gives me new power to reach Agnäs, which I do by 16 o’clock and after some 35 km. Alas, unless I’d like to stay another night at Agnäs Stugor, Agnäs doesn’t offer much in terms of scenic camp spots.</p>

<p>So onwards it is. I follow a bit of the Klangvägen trail and prompt lose the Öreälvsleden trail, and after some searching I find it again and follow its signs. By now I really feel the distance I have hiked already today, and just wish that I soon arrive at the Storforsen Hut. That, however, doesn’t happen until 18 o’clock and some 42+ km hiked. I drop my gear into the hut, which looks like it’s well visited, and go out and enjoy the spectacular sunset over the Storforsen rapids. After that it’s time for one of the tastiest Meals I have along, <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/real-turmat-chicken-curry-bf/?pid=10239">Chicken Curry from REAL Turmat</a>. I put some logs into the small stove inside and am amazed at how quickly it has heated up the hut - it’s so warm that I soon sit just in my boxer shorts inside, eating my tasty Dinner, looking forward to calling it a night!</p>

<p>The next morning rain is hitting the tin roof and I decide to sleep till 7 am. By the time I get out of my quilt the weather looks better and while the sky is grey it isn’t raining for the time being. I’m surprisingly feeling really good even after the Marathon distance of the previous day, and by 9 o’clock am packed up and hiking again - but before that I explore the Hanging Bridge and the rapids!</p>

<p>Less than four kilometres later I reach the Långholmarna Hut, and this was the last really nice hut along the trail - but this I didn’t know yet. I put down my pack and cleaned my feet in the river here - the water was easier to reach than up at the Storforsen Hut - and am wondering where I will sleep tonight.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Långholmarna Hut I left the Bjurholm community and entered the Nordmaling community, and the difference was seen quite clearly: While there were well-established sections of trail on the southern part, there were also a lot of sections of trail where one was bush-whacking through chin-high undergrowth, searching for trail blazes and wondering if one was right, and generally the trail was not as well maintained as in the northern part. However, there were also very beautiful parts: High esker ridges which gave wide views across the landscape, colourful forests and pretty places along the river which were very inviting for a break!</p>

<p>I arrived around 16 o’clock at the very nice and new camping place of the tiny village Hummelholm, and just as I was sitting down in the fire shelter the heavens opened and it started to pour down like mad. I was happy that I was lucky enough to sit under a roof that moment, and I observed the rain from the shelter, waiting for it to stop. After 20 minutes the rain passed and I shouldered my pack again, and though I rather would have stayed right there as I already had hiked over 24 km I knew I needed to push on till Torrböle and the Lean-to there. I hiked on the street through Hummelholm and happily left the asphalt road behind at the end of the village. Here the trail was super-well maintained: Trail blazes in regular distances, little benches along the river, bridges and even duck boards over especially swampy sections. The trail released me into a scenic field and I knew that I now was close to my intended camping spot.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37375863944/in/album-72157688561043576/" title="Fields"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4512/37375863944_4d714af688_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Fields" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>What I didn’t knew was that the signs for the trail in the tiny village of Torrböle were well hidden, and so I was searching for 45 Minutes for where the trail should continue, until I finally saw the right street and the bridge over the river. However, the confusion of signs and marks on the trees on the other side did cost me another 20 minutes until I finally found the lean-to shelter. Slightly annoyed I pitched the Hapi Sil, got water and built up a fire in the lean-to. I didn’t linger to long around the fire and soon went off to my shelter to catch some sweet dreams.</p>

<h2 id="final-section-to-the-baltic">Final Section to the Baltic</h2>

<p>I had some 25 km left until the end of the trail, and as I needed to still get to Nordmaling to catch a Bus back to Umeå I wanted to be well in time. As the birds started singing I was up, and by 8 o’clock I was back on the trail. Sadly the confusion of which direction to go was still the same as the day before, but after some bullish following of the compass bearing I found the trail. Along several nice rapids for packrafting and fishing I followed the river towards the Baltic, happy to reach it but also sad that my solo hike would soon be over.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long and the trail was following pretty much exclusively forest roads and even asphalt roads. There were some enjoyable sections of nice, narrow forest trails intertwined along the way, but of the 25 km I hiked that day over 20 km were on forest roads and asphalt roads. That made the hiking not very nice - I very much prefer soft forest paths or mountain trails for moving in nature. It was thus quite nice to finally reach the end of the trail in Alvik. I could see the Baltic in the distance, and after having hiked so many kilometres on roads my feet were hurting. I had luck, though - Claudia and her family were picking berries close by and would pick me up and give me a ride to the Bus and Railway Station in Nordmaling! So I got out of my shoes and enjoyed the feeling of gravel and grass, while looking on the river Öreälv and how it now slowly was reaching the end of its journey, a journey which I now had accompanied for 124 km from Örträsk till here!</p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that I highly recommend the Öreälvsleden trail. I enjoyed the wilderness of the northern part which is just a couple of hours away from Umeå, which makes it very easily accessible. I want to visit the trail again - and take my packraft this time! Hence I would recommend if you’d like to visit the trail to take a packraft and hike from around the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/B8dYU3S7eQ42">Tallbergsbroarna</a> North to Örträsk and then paddle back down - that way one can explore the best part of the Öreälvsleden Trail and one avoids the not so nice hiking on forest roads. If you’re into (fly) fishing you also should take a rod with you, as there’s lot of places along the river where you can try your luck. You can even order a permit via your cellphone!</p>

<p>Finally, make sure to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/sets/72157688561043576">check out the Flickr Album</a> with over 150 photos from along the trail to get an even better impression of it.</p>

<h2 id="getting-there-food--accommodation">Getting There, Food &amp; Accommodation</h2>

<p>To get to the start of the trail you’ll first need to <a href="https://www.visitumea.se/en/travel-to-umea">get to Umeå</a> - if you’re coming from Finland hop on the <a href="https://www.wasaline.com/en/">Wasaline Ferry</a> like me and enjoy the scenary on deck when the weather is good. From Umeå you can take either a Bus to Bjurholm or Agnäs to spend a night indoors before you hit the trail, or head directly to Örträsk and camp at the lake or at the Floaters Dam. <a href="https://reseplanerare.resrobot.se/index.html">Resrobot</a> helps you plan the trip with public transportation to the start of the trail and back to Umeå when you have reached the Baltic.</p>

<p>In Umeå I slept at the YMCA Hostel which I can not endorse this time (unlike previous times, when it has been fine). I’d recommend finding a nice <a href="www.airbnb.com/c/hmorkel">AirBnB</a> or stay at one of the <a href="https://www.visitumea.se/en/stay">Hotels</a> in the city. I ate at <a href="http://vezzo.se">Vezzo</a> and it was DELICIOUS, the Calzone and the Goat-cheese Salad are highly recommended and they also have some tasty local beers on tap. There’s other nice places around, best is you use Tripadvisor when in town to find something which suits your wants.</p>

<h2 id="maps--gear">Maps &amp; Gear</h2>

<p>There’s a Swedish language Hiking and Fishing Map of the complete trail, but it isn’t very detailed and also slightly outdated. You can <a href="http://www.visitbjurholm.nu/sites/bjurholm/files/orealven_2013_liten.pdf">see it here</a>. For more Infos on the trail visit the <a href="https://www.visitumea.se/fi/varaa/tehtava/a475875/vandra_langs_orealven__475875/showdetails?filter=c%3D24264">Öreälven River Trail website</a>.</p>

<p>Because of the camera gear, drone and the forecasted rain I opted to use the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/arcteryx-bora-ar-50-backpack-trekking-backpack/?pid=10239">Arc’teryx Bora AR 50 Backpack</a> because it was slightly larger in volume than the Osprey Levity 45 which I planned on using. I slept under the Vaude Alpstein 450 quilt on my trusty <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/therm-a-rest-neoair-xtherm.html">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XTherm</a>. I slept one night in the <a href="http://locusgear.com/items/hapi-sil/?lang=en">Locus Gear Hapi Sil</a> and had the <a href="http://www.rutalocura.com/trekking_poles.html">Ruta Locura Yana Poles</a> along, water was boiled with the <a href="http://bit.ly/2xKSMG0">Jetboil MicroMo</a>. I used the <a href="http://bit.ly/2z2OFsC">La Sportiva Akyra</a> for the first time and they were OK, as it was very rainy the shoes stayed wet from start to finish (never mind the 10 minutes the first two mornings where I managed to dry them a wee bit). Other gear were tried &amp; trusted favourites: The <a href="http://bit.ly/2fij250">Arc’teryx Satoro AR Zip Top</a> as a long-sleeve, over which I wore the <a href="http://amzn.to/2dO11Gm">Black Diamond Coefficient Vest</a> or a <a href="http://bit.ly/2jQ9i4U">Arc’teryx Proton LT Hoody</a>. I mostly wore the <a href="http://bit.ly/2wawi0l">Houdini Aegis Jacket</a> over all those, and on my legs there were the <a href="http://bit.ly/2fiiGer">Arc’teryx Gamma Rock Pants</a> while on my head there was the well-used <a href="http://bit.ly/2dZuBfn">Arc’teryx Neutro Visor</a> and the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/06/julbo-trek-zebra.html">Julbo Trek Sunglasses</a>.</p>

<p>Our seven day backpacking trip through the Cairngorms is now over and it was fantastic. It was my first time in Scotland (I’ve been to the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/lake-district/">Lake District</a> before) and I loved every moment of it - except maybe those few hours where I was hiking on a terrible “path” up to Corrour Bothy! Expect a full trip report in the next weeks and some accompanying articles, but for the moment enjoy these impressions from the Cairngorms.</p>
