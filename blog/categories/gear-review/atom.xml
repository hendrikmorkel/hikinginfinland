<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>The <a href="">Gregory Optic 48</a> is a lightweight backpack that can carry heavier loads up to 17 kg in good comfort, though it really shines when used with a lightweight load of 9 to 11 kg. Smart details like easily accessible side mesh pockets, good hipbelt pockets and a large front mesh pocket make this a great entry of the 40 year old brand into the lightweight backpacking niche. <a href="https://youtu.be/NQsQYYp34qU">Watch the video</a> to see the pack in action:</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>The pack arrived during the summer at the Hiking in Finland HQ and has been out for dayhikes and a 90+ km off-trail trip in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/09/impressions-from-are-and-valadalen.html">Vålådalen</a>, Sweden.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>As you can imagine, the function of a backpack is to carry your gear. The Gregory Optic 48 wants to do this in comfort, in a light package, and one that last you a life time.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30173126507/in/dateposted/" title="Taking in that view"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1969/30173126507_822b2a8317_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Taking in that view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>Straight from the Gregory Optic Website, here’s the list of features this pack has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An included raincover</li>
  <li>A removable lid and an included lid flap</li>
  <li>An internal hydration sleeve and a port</li>
  <li>A Sunglass stow on the shoulder strap</li>
  <li>Spacious front mesh pocket</li>
  <li>Side mesh pockets with quick access waterbottle stow</li>
</ul>

<p>The backpack is available in a small, medium and large back length and you should measure your back to get the right size.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/45061734512/in/dateposted/" title="Break on the pass"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1927/45061734512_5baf247e39_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Break on the pass" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>I didn’t find any technical innovations in the pack, all the features have been seen before, also in packs of a similar or lighter weight. Gregory probably disagrees, as they find their AeroSpan Suspension an innovation (it is a lighter version of their VaporSpan suspension).</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>As I told in the video, the first backpack I ever bought from my own money was a Gregory (Model Weekender, some 60+ l if I remember correctly, in green and black) way back in 1999. I used this pack for 11 years, backpacking in Central America (I lived in Honduras for one year as I was 18/ 19), hiking in Finland, and for lots of travelling. That pack was bombproof and if I wouldn’t have lost it in an accident I still might be using it. Also the Optic 48 inspires the same durability, it’s made from a 100D High Tenacity Nylon in the main body and a 210D High Tenacity Nylon in the bottom, with a 7001 Hollow Aluminium Frame and the hipbelt and shoulder straps use a Multi-Density - Lifespan EVA for cushioning. I have no doubt that you could thru-hike several long trails with this pack and it wouldn’t look worse than on the first day on the trail!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44199753085/in/dateposted/" title="Whoop whoop!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1971/44199753085_7c07579527_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Whoop whoop!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The main pack with all straps and the lid pocket weighs 1181 g in back length L, the lid flap weighs 34 g and the rain cover 90 g. I haven’t weigh the lid but if you don’t need the extra storage + organizational space it gives you I imagine you can save another 150 g or so. I also think that by cutting down the straps to my length I could save a maybe another 30 or so grams. This puts the Optic 48 in the lightweight backpack category for me.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I’ll base my assessment of the pack mostly on my 90 km hike in Vålådalen, as that was when I carried a lot of gear with the pack for four days. I have used the pack on day hikes, though as I then carry usually not a lot of weight I find that not representable. On that backpacking trip in Vålådalen I did some very long days - the longest was 38 km, of which were 21 km off-trail. Yes, on that day I really felt the pack and got quite familiar with it, and as you can imagine I was happy when I found around 22:00 clock in the beam of my headlamp a good spot to pitch the tent and lay down.</p>

<p>OK, so the pack. I really like the very stretchy mesh side and front pocket, especially the front pocket can take a lot of gear - first I carried my hardshell pants and jacket in them, then later on the flysheet of the tent and the rubbish (empty packaging from meals and snacks). Also the side pockets are really big, I carried in one both my tripod and the Gorillapod, and in the other one my 1l BeFree Bottle and my Kuksa cup. The side pockets I also can access with the pack on my back, which is good when I want to have my cup to drink from a stream. The hipbelt pockets are also very well designed, they open &amp; close easily with one hand and are big enough for several snacks each.</p>

<p>The Optic 48 is easy to pack, I can stow my UL kit with plenty of room to spare for food and camera gear in it. I have not used the raincover ever, for me this is unnecessary and even hiking in the rain and strong wind the gear stayed dry in it. The top of the pack is really easy to open and close, if you have a lot of kit with you you could strap some of it on top, affix it with the strap and lid, and be good to go. At the front I had my trekking poles attached, which worked OK - the baskets on my poles are small and tended to slip through the loop at the bottom, but the adjustable strap at the top kept them securely in place. If your trekking poles have larger baskets than mine, you’re fine! I really haven’t used the side compression straps or the possibility to strap something underneath the pack, but it’s good to know they’re there.</p>

<p>The harness, shoulder straps and ventilated back work well together, especially the harness and straps are very comfortable and carry well, though I do wish the shoulder straps would be a bit more apart at the top, which should make them even more comfortable. As I left the Vålådalen Fjällstation I was carrying 17 kg of weight (that is including food for four days, 1 l of water and an unreasonable amount of camera gear). Yes, the pack felt heavy, but not uncomfortable. Once the straps were correctly adjusted the weight was transferred nicely to the hipbelt and shoulders, and even when I was boulder hopping I never felt unsafe or burdened. Generally I don’t see much use in ventilated back panels, maybe it is because I either way sweat a lot, I am not hiking in 30°C or more temperatures or something else, I don’t know. The idea certainly is good, I just don’t know if they work.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>While the shoulder straps do work for me, I think they could be made even better by making them wider at the top where they connect to the pack. As they are the straps are rather close together, which can be uncomfortable for some people. I also would like if the shoulder straps would be slightly more narrow so that it would be easier to connect my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/10/gear-of-the-year-2015-peak-design-capture-pro-camera-clip.html">Peak Design Capture Clip V3</a> to it, right now it is a rather tight fit. And if a future Gregory lightweight pack gets rid of the ventilated back and puts the shoulder straps further apart I think they could have a really amazing pack!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44199763275/in/dateposted/" title="The Shoulder Straps"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1950/44199763275_9943a38b67_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Shoulder Straps" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I am very happy with how the Optic 48 has carried a rather heavy load in Sweden, kept the gear inside dry and was comfortable also on very long &amp; strenuous days. It is a lightweight pack which is best suited to people who carry heavier loads (for example who go out backpacking to take photos and carry a tripod, heavy lenses and accessories, in addition to the camping kit) and those who want a backpack which will last them a long time, no matter how careless they treat the pack when they are out. With its easily accessible side and hipbelt pockets you don’t need to take the pack off when you want to eat or drink something, and the lid with its two zippered pockets offers a good place to store smaller items like your phone, keys, wallet, spare batteries and the map + notebook. The well cushioned shoulder straps and hipbelt feel great and are a nice change to thinner UL carrying systems. In conclusion, I’m looking forward to take the Optic out again in the future on long hikes where I carry heavier loads - and everyone who does not carry 5 kg of camera gear likely will really enjoy this backpack on their wilderness hikes!</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/sestrals-quilt/">As Tucas Sestrals Quilt</a> is a very light, comfortable and very well made synthetic quilt. It packs small, has little problems with condensation and other sources of moisture, and keeps you toasty at night. Watch the Video to get the full low-down in moving images:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LobFMfTkPsU?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I received the As Tucas Sestrals Quilt in time for my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/10/impressions-from-the-scottish-cairngorms.html">Cairngorms Traverse</a> last October and have used the quilt on half a dozen trips in the autumn and spring since. Overall it has been slept under for some 14 nights and been used since nine months.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/41397124365/in/album-72157669299782358/" title="Sleeping in the Cairngorms"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/958/41397124365_8491cce6ce_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sleeping in the Cairngorms" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The function of a quilt, like a sleeping bag, is to keep you warm at night. Ideally it is light and packs compact during the day, and is comfortable, easy to use and warm during the night when you are resting.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42298583301/in/album-72157669299782358/" title="Bivy camp in Sipoonkorpi NP"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/950/42298583301_a946a2896b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bivy camp in Sipoonkorpi NP" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The Sestrals packs a bunch of features, here’s the list straight from the As Tucas Website:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is <em>Longer than most quilts</em></li>
  <li>It is <em>Wider than most quilts</em></li>
  <li>It has a <em>Closed footbox</em></li>
  <li><em>Very easy to use</em></li>
  <li>Made from <em>schoeller®-ftc fabric with ecorepel® finish</em></li>
  <li>Uses <em>Climashield® APEX</em> synthetic insulation, available in three weights</li>
  <li><em>Handcrafted in the Pyrenees, Spain</em></li>
  <li>Available in four lengths, two widths and three insulation strengths (for a total of 24 different configurations - without the colour options!)</li>
</ul>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42298586971/in/album-72157669299782358/" title="As Tucas logo patch"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/886/42298586971_75b6398069_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="As Tucas logo patch" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>I have used dozens of (down) quilts and have seen lots of different designs, so it’s hard to see something new. However, I really like that As Tucas uses a schoeller fabric for this quilt, schoeller from Switzerland make some of the best UL fabrics out there, and they’re not just light &amp; functional but also have a solid environmental record.</p>

<p>Oh, and while I’m not 100% sure, I think this quilt qualifies as being Vegan 🌿💚</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The craftsmanship is top-notch. It is a very well designed and manufactured piece of kit and I found nothing to complain about.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>My As Tucas Sestrals Quilt is a Size M with a Regular Width and an Climashield Apex 200 insulation, and weighs 658 g. That is a wee bit heavier than the claimed weight of 625 g but still acceptable.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/41397110345/in/album-72157669299782358/" title="Size comparison"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/976/41397110345_26cbe02531_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Size comparison" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I have used some 18 years ago a light and compact synthetic sleeping bag. It packed about the same size as the Sestrals quilt, but it was nowhere near as warm or easy to use as this quilt. Happily I used it mostly in Central America, where it didn’t get too cold at night! As I started to pay attention to the weight of the gear in my backpack some 10 years ago I quickly switched to a quilt. The advantages for me were just too good to pass up, and it has improved my nights outdoors so much that I would encourage anyone who camps outdoors to try a quilt. The Sestrals Quilt from As Tucas is my first synthetic quilt, and thus far I really enjoy using it.</p>

<p>I love how simple it is constructed and how seams have been kept to a minimum, but at the same time paying attention to useful features like the longer hood. It packs down to a compact package and with some pushing and getting the air out I can pack it down to a size of around 6 l volume (that Helsport drybag it is in on the photos is a 10 l sack). It fluffs out easily when in camp, and condensation and dew do it no harm. I have had in the past some sketchy nights in the mountains when from the really warm day temperatures the thermometer suddenly plummets towards 0°C as soon as the sun sets - in those conditions gear that lays outside immediately starts to accumulate small droplets of water, and I had some uncomfortable nights with down quilts in the past.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28425850028/in/album-72157669299782358/" title="Morning dew on the quilt"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/881/28425850028_0ffdbeace8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Morning dew on the quilt" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With the Sestrals Quilt that is no longer a worry. There’s two fabrics to thank for that: First is the schoeller ftc fabric with the ecorepel finish, which is water repellant and the dew or rain just forms in little drops on the top of the fabric (as seen in the photo above, which I shot during my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/microadventure-sipoonkorpi-national-park.html">Sipoonkorpi Microadventure</a>) and that sweet fabric is also free from fluorocarbons (PFC), so it is not harmful to humans, animals and nature. Secondly, the Climashield APEX insulation is synthetic and does not collapse from moisture, unlike down (Hydrophobic down is another story). I had a down sleeping bag collapse on top of me on a winter trip (I sweated it wet) and that was a very uncomfortable night. Even when the quilt would get wet the insulation would not collapse, so while you still might have an uncomfortable night under a wet synthetic quilt you actually could wring it dry and possibly have a halfway decent sleep (now there’s an idea for a future article!).</p>

<p>But away from such horror scenarios! A quilt for me needs to pack small while I am hiking and be light, and on both accounts the Sestrals quilt convinces. At camp I want to easily unpack it and not need to worry about condensation, where it also scores top marks. And then it obviously needs to be warm, comfortable and easy to use while sleeping. I tuck in the quilt at my sides when I go to sleep, and usually have a leg out to “cool down”. I also turn a lot while sleeping, from my left to my back to my right to my stomach and back, and with a quilt that is no problem. I remember nights in a sleeping bag where I ended up trapped inside because I turned too much, and well, that just ain’t nice. All quilts give you that freedom of movement, and the Sestrals maybe even gives you a little bit more freedom because there’s no drawstrings and straps which can trap you.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42251990132/in/album-72157669299782358/" title="Side view"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/978/42251990132_73498f30bd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Side view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Warmth-wise the Climashield Apex 200 is rated to -5°C Comfort, and I found that a realistic rating. In Scotland we had some cold nights which were around the -2°C mark, and I was toasty under the quilt. I am a very warm sleeper so these kind of ratings are always dependent on the person, your metabolism, and many other factors. If you easily feel cold at night take at minimum the APEX 167 quilt if you want to use it from spring to autumn, or maybe even the APEX 200 if you really, really easily feel cold.</p>

<p>In the morning the quilt dries fast in the sun if some dew collected on it (in black at least), and it is easy to pack up again to a compact package, ready to hike. And while I haven’t washed it yet (it hasn’t seen <em>that</em> much use yet) it should be easy to clean this quilt, just toss it in the washing machine, wash it at 40° and then hang it to dry. No need to send it to a special dry cleaner or throw tennis balls into the dryer, like you have to with a down sleeping bag.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>The quilt itself is for me pretty much perfect, but I would like that it also comes with a stuff sack or dry bag when you buy it. A spacious storage bag is included, so the absence of a stuff sack for hiking was a bit strange - a cuben dry bag would be perfect!</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>In ultralight backpacking you always try to optimize the gear to the conditions of the trip ahead. The As Tucas Sestrals Quilt is my spring, summer and autumn quilt when the temperatures at night are expected to be around 0°C but can go colder, and when I expect a lot of rain and wet ground. For these trips the Sestrals quilt has performed admiringly and I had never any concerns that I might have a cold night - be it hiking in the rain in Scotland and camping out or on the Microadventure near Helsinki earlier this month. It is light, compact and very easy &amp; comfortable in use, and I like to take it along on most trips as it’s just a very well made piece of kit that I know will perform and which I don’t need to worry about. With that it makes my backpacking trips more relaxing, and I have had great nights of sleep under the quilt. I look forward to take it along on a trip with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/eno-sub6-hammock-review.html">ENO Sub6 Hammock</a> later this summer and see how it works in a hammock 🌳🌲!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Finland, Sweden and Norway we have plenty of 🌳🌲🌲🌳🌲🌲🌳🌳🌲🌲🌲, a logical conclusion is thus to carry a hammock when you want to relax in the forest! In the past hammocks have been bulky, heavy and difficult to set up - that is not the case if you carry the ultralight ENO Sub6 Hammock and the amazing ENO Helios Suspension System. They let you lay in your hammock in less than two minutes on your next backpacking trip or day hike - reason enough for me to check them out!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42175363991/in/dateposted/" title="Chilling"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/910/42175363991_ba6803793f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Chilling" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I have tried several hammocks over the last years, but never really fell in love with them. Either they were too bulky, too uncomfortable or just too troublesome to set up. That changed as the <a href="https://www.partioaitta.fi/shop/eagle-nest-outfitters-sub6-hammock-1005617-charcoal/">Sub6 Hammock</a> and the <a href="https://www.partioaitta.fi/shop/eagle-nest-outfitters-helios-suspension-system-1005620-grey/">Helios Suspension System</a> from <a href="https://www.partioaitta.fi/tuotemerkit/eagle-nest-outfitters/">Eagle Nest Outfitters</a> arrived at Hiking in Finland HQ. At first I couldn’t believe how tiny and light the hammock and tree straps were, so I went out in the garden to see if they really work.</p>

<p>Well, they do! I came back in, showed them to my wife (who loves hammocks!) and told her that I got a nice hammock in which she can relax the next time we go on a day hike or visit the beach. She too couldn’t believe how light and compact they were, but after another demonstration in the garden she was convinced! <em>“So how light are they?”</em> you might be wondering. Well, according to my scale the Sub6 Hammock is 163 g including the Stuff Sack, and the Helios Suspension System is 123 g total, that’s 5 g for the stuff sack and 58 g per strap. Together they are 286 g, which is pretty amazing in my books!</p>

<p>Since then I had the hammock along on some bike rides and day hikes and was always again amazed at how light and how easy to set up this combo is. That alone means it’s almost a no-brainer to take these two along instead of a sit pad, as they are smaller than a 500 ml water bottle (in Fact they are so small that I sometimes need to rummage through my backpack to find them =). It now takes me less than two minutes to put up the hammock to the trees and lay down in it, and after some practicing I also have it down to operate the stove from the hammock and prepare the coffee while chilling! It adds a whole new layer of relaxation in nature to my hikes, and I have found myself napping in the shade of the trees while the wind plays with the leafs far above me.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42175346741/in/dateposted/" title="Boiling water from the hammock"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/968/42175346741_2d7f8f5f84_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Boiling water from the hammock" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But that ain’t all: ENO makes everything you would need for hammocking, including an underquilt so you don’t get cold, the Underbelly Gear Sling which is a Mini-Hammock for your backpack &amp; gear, a bug net to keep the Mosquitos out and a Tarp which keeps you dry. That means if you fall in love with hammocking after you’ve had the Sub6 along on some day hikes and feel like you want to sleep in it, you now can add the gear you need and are ready for sleeping elevated in the forest! I have a bunch of ENO hammocking gear here and plan to try hammock camping again this summer, and I have a feeling that I will like it much better this time around.</p>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong> it is safe to say that for day trips in the forest and afternoons at the beach we have a tiny &amp; light addition to the backpack with the ENO Helios Suspension System and the Sub6 Hammock. They are easy to put up, so very comfortable to chill in and don’t need a lot of space in the backpack. And with all the 🌲🌲🌳🌲🌲🌲🌳🌲 we have here in Finland it’s about time we elevate ourselves from the ground! If you’d like to try the Sub6 Hammock and Helios Suspension System yourselves, head over to <a href="https://www.partioaitta.fi/tuotemerkit/eagle-nest-outfitters/">Partioaitta</a> who carry the gear here in Finland!</p>

<p>I met GoPro at the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/ispo-2016-news-iii.html">ISPO</a> earlier this year and had a nice chat with them, and when they asked if I’d be interested in testing their HERO4 Session I said yes. While my experience with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2011/10/gopro-hd-hero2.html">GoPro Hero 2</a> was more like <em>Meh</em> and also the Garmin Virb was something I seldom would take along, I have had the HERO4 Session a lot outdoors in the last months. As a Photographer video is usually just a side-consideration for me, but as I am pondering videos more seriously it is nice to have a small, light and good video camera.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>As usually I put my <a href="http://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/cameras/hero-session/CHDHS-102-master.html">HERO4 Session</a> through a serious testing period to see how it performs in many different situations. The HERO4 Session arrived in February at Hiking in Finland HQ and has been along ski-touring in Norway, hiking, paddling and caving in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/07/multi-adventures-in-macedonia.html">Macedonia</a>, bouldering and sea kayaking on <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/08/cycling-and-bouldering-on-aland.html">Åland</a> and climbing, hiking and watching the sun set in Greece, and comes with me when I am going to South Tyrol next month and most likely also to Mexico in November. As the Session 5 was just announced last week I felt it is about time to review this wee camera cube (though GoPro wished I’d done it ages ago =).</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The GoPro HERO4 Session’s function is summed up pretty easily: Document your adventures, be they skiing in Lyngen, climbing in Greece, hiking in Finland or enjoying the beach with your family. It takes crisp 1080 HD Videos, makes pretty Timelapses and photos from your activities, and lets you easily share them.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5XH4xSksyo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>One Button Video Recording - and push it once more to stop recording and turn the camera off</li>
  <li>One Button Timelapse out of the box, easy to adjust via the camera or the GoPro app on your phone</li>
  <li>Wifi and Bluetooth allows you to control the Session via your tablet or smartphone</li>
  <li>Waterproof to 10 m without a housing</li>
  <li>Dozens and dozens of mounts to attach it to almost anything imaginable</li>
</ul>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810989151/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="On the way back to Mariehamn from Kobba Klintar"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8695/28810989151_e0db3046b1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="On the way back to Mariehamn from Kobba Klintar" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>The Session is one of the smallest action cameras on the market. It’s a tiny cube which is why I found it so useful to take along on my trips. The “Press one button and it records” feature is also great, gone the times of where you’re wearing a GoPro and first push it on and then hit the record button, often not sure if it actually is now recording or not. That same button you can push a wee bit longer and it records a Timelapse, and this I found pretty cool as video and timelapse with one push of a button is a great step forward in user friendliness.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The camera itself is high-quality and bumps into the rock wall, dropping it into my pack and letting it go dive in the salty Baltic and fresh water lakes didn’t bother it at all. The front lens glass protector has been kept scratch-free during all this time, one just needs to be careful to not touch it with greasy fingers as that can get messy (but easy enough to clean). I believe this camera can survive several years of use and abuse without problems.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26634868293/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Exit through the Gift Shop"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7419/26634868293_442d643a1e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Exit through the Gift Shop" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The Session weighs a mere 71 g. Add in a case (16 g) and a mount like an <a href="http://amzn.to/2dt32sU">adhesive mount</a> (11 g) or the <a href="http://amzn.to/2cZCP9C">Tripod/ Selfie Stick</a> (215 g) and it’s a bit more, but especially with the latter you can take pretty ace photos and videos of yourself in action or fold the legs out and take a time-lapse of the sunset, all for a combined weight of 303 g (That’s the 3-Way Arm, a cage for the camera and the Session itself).</p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>You can <a href="http://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/refurbished/">buy refurbished cameras from GoPro</a> directly, which is a cool move and puts less GoPros into the waste streams of the world. Also on their website they have a lengthy website dedicated to <a href="https://gopro.com/casupplychaindisclosure">social and environmental matters</a>, while <a href="https://gopro.com/goproforacause">GoPro Cause</a> lets you get involved or donate with social projects around the world.</p>

<p>How to get rid of an old GoPro, though? If you life in Europe you should be aware of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/index_en.htm">WEEE Directive</a> which means electronic waste does not belong into your normal household waste. It gives you ideas where you can get rid of your old camera (and other electronic garbage, like that TV, the old Playstation and the broken cellphone from 2003).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29857913641/in/dateposted/" title="The tiny GoPro HERO4 Session likes the autumn"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5542/29857913641_e98d176270_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The tiny GoPro HERO4 Session likes the autumn" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I have used the HERO4 Session more as I thought I would. Unlike some of my blogger friends (Hey there <a href="http://www.travelingjackie.com">Jackie</a>!) who often only use a GoPro and their smartphone my main tool is a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/photography/">camera</a> as I earn money with my photography. Now while the Session does take photos they’re usually not something a magazine is looking for, hence I carry my <a href="http://amzn.to/2drNeXo">Sony RX 100 IV</a> wherever I go. But the HERO4 Session is so small, light and intuitive that it’s a great addition to a small camera, especially for activities like climbing, skiing and cycling where it’s nice to attach the camera to yourself or your equipment and film your adventure.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lI1uuFphJSU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>What I like most about the HERO4 Session - and I might repeat myself here - is that it is so easy to use. Push the button and it records - push again and it’s finished. Push the button 3 seconds and it starts to record a timelapse. Push again and it stops. Accessing the settings is easy on the device as the User Interface is really smartly designed, and you can change the camera angle (from wide to medium), timelapse settings - from 0,5 seconds to 60 seconds - and a bunch more, all via the two buttons on the camera</p>

<p>All you need to start is a <a href="http://amzn.to/2cFiX8B">MicroSDXC Card</a> and you’re ready to head out. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2cZCP9C">GoPro 3-Way Grip &amp; Tripod</a> aka a fancy Selfie Stick with tripod legs that hide away has been something that I was very sceptical of (who wouldn’t be sceptical of Selfie Sticks?) but after using it a couple of times and seeing what great footage one can shot with it I was a convert. Now my Session is usually connected to the 3-Way Grip, as it allows for cool angles on the go, a more stable flow when hiking (though I’d like a gimbal for it) and the Tripod legs make it great for filming a timelapse.</p>

<p>The camera is also really durable - bumps against the rock when climbing didn’t bother it, it dived in and out of salt and fresh water without problems, and also took the daily abuse of being carried in a sidepocket or backpack without problems.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29826592252/in/dateposted/" title="GoPro 3-Way Arm &amp; Tripod + legs"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8212/29826592252_1c7fa02698_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="GoPro 3-Way Arm &amp; Tripod + legs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The battery life depends quite a bit on how you use the camera, the temperature, and also if you have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on or off (off means longer battery life but then you can’t control it with your phone). I had the HERO4 Session along in Macedonia and Greece and got a solid two weeks of use out of the camera, and if my memory doesn’t betray me I only once topped it shortly up in the middle of the trip. I take short clips - anything between 10 seconds and 3 minutes, as well as timelpases. Overall I got some 5 timelapses and around 60 clips shot during those two weeks, almost on a single charge (topped up once!). As the HERO€ Session can be charged via USB it is easy to charge it on the trail with a power bank, too. GoPro themselves also answers the <a href="https://gopro.com/support/articles/hero4-session-battery-life">battery life question</a> in detail.</p>

<p>What I found really great is that you can connect the Session to your smartphone, grab a photo or video, edit it on your phone and share it on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">Instagram</a>. Put the camera down and control the Session from your phone - hit record, adjust settings, whatever. It is so easy, you’ll love this feature if you use Social Media and previously just sat on a ton of footage but never did anything with it. There’s even the possibility to <em>find your GoPro</em> in case you’ve lost it under a bunch of papers!</p>

<p>Speaking of editing, GoPro has its own <a href="https://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/softwareandapp/">Apps</a> - for free! - which help you make a movie out of that footage. On the phone and desktop you even can let the App do all the work and you just sit back and see what it comes up with!</p>

<p>As for the footage coming out of it, I found it very nice indeed - for online publication. The photos (see the kayaking photo above) are of good quality for blogs and Social Media and probably could be used in a pinch in a magazine. The videos in 1080 HD are crisp with nice colours &amp; good sound, and the file size is wonderfully small in comparison what my other cameras throw out (as I already own four <a href="http://amzn.to/2dm7Z6l">HD External Hard Drives</a> storage is always a concern!). The HERO4 Session is a big step forward from my older action cameras, as adjusting from dark to bright is now quick &amp; good, and it even works great when <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/videos/1193176694045994/">spelunking in dark caves with bats</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, while I got the HERO4 Session for free without obligations you can find the action camera for as little as 200€ (GoPro themselves ask for <a href="http://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/cameras/hero-session/CHDHS-102-master.html">230€ on their webstore</a>). That’s a pretty good price for such a well-designed camera, although there are action cameras out there which cost just half or less of that. If you’d like to support a company which in those cases rips off GoPro is up to you, I wouldn’t.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>It is hard to pin-point things that I think could be better with the HERO4 Session, but as the HERO5 Session  was just launched I’d say GoPro addressed at least some of my concerns: Better video quality (now with 4K!) and Image stabilization. It now also has 10 Megapixel Photos but remains just as simple &amp; easy to use out of the box as the HERO4 Session I review here. But these were just tiny complaints from my side and I have been more than happy with the HERO4 Session.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>There’s a range of Action Cameras which try to grab some of GoPros market share, most notably Garmin with the VIRB and Sony with its action cameras. Also DJI has tried to enter the market with the <a href="http://amzn.to/2d3fCkD">Osmo</a>, though it serves a slightly different niche. And then there’s the low-cost but still impressive action cameras which cost even less than the Session - I linked to some of these in recent <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/the-week-in-review/">The Week In Reviews</a> so browse them to read about these.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29826592702/in/dateposted/" title="GoPro HERO4 Session Outdoors"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7559/29826592702_395ccb285d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="GoPro HERO4 Session Outdoors" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>In the end the question you should ask yourself is: Do I need a one-click action camera? Are you out enough hiking, climbing, skiing, swimming, paddling, mountaineering, surfing &amp; cycling and wishing you had a small video camera along which films you &amp; your adventurous activities? Do you have the time afterwards to edit your footage and share it with your friends (or will you <a href="https://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/softwareandapp/">use the GoPro Quick Desktop or smartphone app</a> to do so)? Are you ready to drop around 300€ on the HERO4 Session, a MicroSDXC Card and some mounts?</p>

<p>If the answer is yes to all of these questions then I think you will find the GoPro Session a great little action camera. While I was sceptical if I’d use the Session at all - after all I hadn’t used the previous two action cameras I own in many years - it quickly has become something I take along on assignments &amp; when I head out for fun. Because it is so easy to use I am way more likely to actually take it out of my pack and push that button - knowing it will record crisp, cool videos of my friends &amp; me doing what we like most - being outside and having fun! Add in that it does so in an almost unobtrusive way, and that viewing, editing and sharing the footage I have recorded has never been easier and you have a winning package that fits in the palm of your hand.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-it">Where to buy it</h2>

<p>As the Session 5 will come out in a few weeks the HERO4 Session - the one reviewed here - is available for good discounts already. <a href="http://bit.ly/2d9nrnr">REI</a> has a great package and you also find it at <a href="http://amzn.to/2cDx7aA">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/2d1EmYT">Amazon.co.uk</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2du8aA6">Amazon.de</a> for a good price.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I got the <a href="http://www.swixsport.com/Products/Poles/Trekking-Poles/Swix-Sonic-Pro-Trail-Carbon">Swix Sonic Pro Trail Carbon 120</a> in July 2016 and have been using them on day hikes, a trail run and as poles for pitching my shelters on Microadventures. They haven’t seen as much use as I usually would put a piece of kit through before I write about them, but this being a sponsored post I sadly didn’t have the freedom to test them for 12 months &amp; longer =) However, I intend to take them along to a trip to the Alps this autumn where I’ll be backpacking for a week and after that I will feel more confident about a final statement.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>As I highlighted in my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-ultra-distance-trekking-poles.html">Black Diamond Ultra Distance Trekking Poles</a> Review, trekking poles have many advantages outdoors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They help you to keep your balance on difficult terrain</li>
  <li>Useful in fording rivers</li>
  <li>Can be transformed into a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/trailpix-ultralight-tripod.html">tripod</a> or used with a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/interview-rod-java-from-thestickpic-com.html">StickPic</a> for photography</li>
  <li>They can pitch your tarp or shelter</li>
  <li>They train your upper body muscles when hiking and running</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The Swix Sonic Pro Trail Carbon is available in fixed lengths from 100 to 135 cm in 5 cm intervals. All of the poles have the following features in common:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compact folding system</li>
  <li>Comfort Connection system</li>
  <li>Multi grip from cork with EVA extension</li>
  <li>Flexi basket system</li>
  <li>Swix carbon technology Swix CT1 grade</li>
  <li>Folded pack size is 39 cm</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>I’ve used a fair share of trekking poles, some lighter, some heavier. I can’t really say that these poles have any mind-blowing innovations in them, although there’s a few things I do like about them - read on to find out what.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The quality is very good. The trekking poles make a solid impression, the construction of the segments is clean and smooth and they fit well together, and also the grip is well made (from European cork!). As Swix has many years of experience in the making of carbon poles (for cross country skiing) they were able to use this expertise and apply it to the production of their trekking poles.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28867841714/in/dateposted/" title="The Tip protector"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7493/28867841714_414d044771_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Tip protector" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>My poles in 120 cm length weigh 153 g per pole including the little baskets, so the pair of them weighs 306 g. This makes them more heavy than my BD Poles, but I imagine this weight will reflect positively on the durability of the poles. On the plus side, that’s 29 g lighter as Swix claims they would be!</p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>Swix has a page about their interaction with the <a href="http://www.swixsport.com/Environment">environment</a>. On their page about <a href="http://www.swixsport.com/Environment/Swix-Products-and-the-Environment">Swix Products and the environment</a> they tell us rather broadly that <em>“Swix maintains a strong social responsibility program and has a focus on environmental awareness in product production. This is repeated in all aspects, both in the choice of raw materials, the use of recyclable packaging and more.”</em> This is not really going into details and doesn’t tell us much besides that they use recycable packaging. Happily there’s some more info on the <a href="http://www.swixsport.com/Environment/Swix-Environmental-Ethics">Swix Environmental Ethics</a> page, where they tell us that they do Climate accounting (with quite old data from 2009) and in which organizations they’re members. I would have wished for more infos on how &amp; where I could get a pole fixed and how I should get rid of them in case they break one day.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28867841314/in/dateposted/" title="The folding mechanism"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8679/28867841314_2f380b0500_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The folding mechanism" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>The Swix Sonic Pro Trail Carbon 120 Trekking Poles are for me a 3-season pole because of their cork grip - I imagine they would be OK when hiking in the winter as long as you don’t let the cork get wet. They come with indicated Left &amp; Right hand straps that sadly are not easy to remove. They are OK to use and don’t have any hard plastic parts which could push uncomfortably into the skin, but I really feel I don’t need them and want the option to easily remove them. <strong>Update</strong>: <em>Stian Hagen from Swix informed me that cork is great for winter use and that Swix has used all cork grips already since 20 years on the XC skiing poles. The friction of the cork is good, its light, and its warm.</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28872979203/in/dateposted/" title="L &amp; R straps"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8334/28872979203_778998eb0d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="L &amp; R straps" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In use the cork handles are very comfortable, the cork grip lays good in the hand when hiking in flat terrain and up, while the rounded top is good to hold when descending. When navigating through steep terrain the longer EVA part makes gripping the pole lower nice, though as I said - I’d prefer a full cork grip. Even with sweaty hands in hot weather the cork feels more comfortable and doesn’t slip as easily as EVA. <strong>Update</strong>: <em>Stian Hagen from Swix let me know that they decided to use cork on the lower part as it saves weight and as it is not used that often they felt this was a good trade-off.</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28867837064/in/dateposted/" title="Handle of the Sonic Pro"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8020/28867837064_02007c24fe_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Handle of the Sonic Pro" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Because I don’t use poles all the time and often fly in a plane to go backpacking the weight and pack size are important to me. The Sonic Pro carbon are pretty good in that respect, as they fold small and fit into the side pocket of my LAUFBURSCHE pack or can be wrapped into a insulation jacket when travelling by plane. Because they fit inside of my pack I even was able to take them along as a carry-on, which is great when you’re flying without checked in luggage!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28873223823/in/dateposted/" title="Folded up for travel, fitting into a carry-on compliant pack!"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8512/28873223823_883a00e6a7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Folded up for travel, fitting into a carry-on compliant pack!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Flexi basket system is really great, I long have wished for an easy way to switch baskets on poles and this has been so easy to use, it’s a pleasure. Where other poles let you change baskets only with the use of lots of force or tools here I simply could unscrew the basket and screw on another one. The small baskets are fine for normal forest trails and established mountain trails, but for swamps and the crossing of summer snow fields a larger one would have been useful. Anyhow, the thread system is great.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28867842054/in/dateposted/" title="Basket of &amp; thread exposed"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8333/28867842054_1b6d9e805c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Basket of &amp; thread exposed" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29203720670/in/dateposted/" title="Flexi basket system, partly unscrewed"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8802/29203720670_d574455666_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Flexi basket system, partly unscrewed" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then to the most important job of my trekking poles: Pitching a shelter! For pitching tarps and pyramides I found the Sonic Pro Trail Carbon splendid because they are very stiff - much more stiff than my BD poles. This is especially good when a single pole is used for putting up a pyramide shelter as it flexes less when gusts hit the shelter, which I find feels safer.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28867841064/in/dateposted/" title="As a tent pole, looking up"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8045/28867841064_833e651a8b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="As a tent pole, looking up" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And finally deploying them and folding them up. Both are a breeze, fast &amp; easy. For getting them ready for hiking you simply hold the hand grip and pull the part out which automatically straightens the pole, until you hear a click and the button jumps out and locks the segments in place. Folding the poles together is just as simple: Push the button back in and the upper part moves slightly back into the handle. Then just push the segment completely in and fold the pole together! Swix wrote that you can use the strap to keep the pole folded together, but I haven’t found out how to do that with a single pole. With both poles I just put them together with the straps on the opposite ends and then thread the segments through them, that way they stay together well. <strong>Update</strong>: <em>Stian Hagen from Swix showed me how to fold them together with one strap - see the photo underneath</em> =)</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I really like the cork grip and would wish the Sonic Pro Trail Carbon pole would have a complete cork handle, thus that the lower EVA part is also cork. It just feels more comfortable on the hand to me, and it’s a shame the lower part is made from EVA. I also would have wished that the strap would be easy to remove. I rarely use straps with poles in the summer and am sure I’d liked it better to save a few more grams than being forced to have it along. I also think that if one buys these poles that it’d be nice to get a choice of baskets with them, because the small trekking baskets aren’t really great in summer snow, swamps and boulder fields where a larger basket would make it easier for the pole not to penetrate too deep. Finally, a notch in the basket so they stay locked together when folded would have been useful, too.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <em>Stian Hagen from Swix wrote me a lengthy Email with some more infos, which I included above already. Apparently it is super easy to remove the strap by just pushing the pin out with a narrow tool like a screw driver at home and then take out the strap. I tried this with some narrow tools but couldn’t get the pin pushed out. Either I’m too weak or possibly I still have a pre-production sample where it isn’t as easy. I’ll update this when I managed to get rid of the strap!</em></p>

<p>The at the beginning mentioned <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-ultra-distance-trekking-poles.html">Black Diamond Poles</a> are a worthy competitor which I know are very long-lasting &amp; robust, and if you can life with poles that have a larger pack size also the <a href="http://www.rutalocura.com/trekking_poles.html">Ruta Locura Yana poles</a> are great poles that I have used since many years very happily. If you need adjustable poles I’d check out the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/swix-sonic-x-trail-carbon-trekkingstoecke/?pid=10239">Swix Sonic X-Trail Carbon</a> which some of my friends will surely write about in a while!</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>Despite not having used them as much as I’d like to the Swix Sonic Pro Trail Carbon 120 Trekking Poles have made a good first impression on me. They are light and comfortable when out hiking and backpacking, allow me to pitch my Pyramide shelters and tarps and let me train my upper body when out for a hike. Keep in mind that I still am not a big trekking pole user when hiking (I use them usually in difficult terrain and for river crossings) although I almost always carry a pair because I need them for my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/shelters/">shelters</a>. As I will be backpacking several more weeks this autumn and will take the Swix Sonic Pro Trail Carbon 120 poles with me for hiking and pitching my shelter I will try to update this article then and reflect on them again after more use.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-it">Where to buy it</h2>

<p><em>Only BUY stuff if you really need it!</em></p>

<p>You can get the pole in every length from <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/swix-sonic-pro-trail-carbon-trekkingstoecke/?pid=10239">Bergfreunde</a> (On offer for 135€!) and <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/swix-sonic-pro-trail-carbon-trailrunningstock/?pid=81">Bergzeit</a>.</p>
