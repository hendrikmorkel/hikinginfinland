<h2 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h2>

<p>Ten years ago, at the beginning of April 2009, I opened up my blog at the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/archives/">hikinginfinland.com</a> domain (<em>actually, back then I was still at Blogspot, but that changed soon</em>). Why did I start my blog? Well, I’ll need to start a few years earlier for that story.</p>

<p>In 2008 I hiked with my best friend Martin on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2009/06/karhunkierros-i.html">Karhunkierros Trail</a> in Lapland. Back then I was far from hiking ultralight, and both Martin and me hiked with well over 20 kg on our backs this popular trail in Finland. On the the last day, motivated by the thought of a nice warm Sauna at home, cold beers and Pizza, we hiked as fast as possible to reach the early bus from Kuusamo to Oulu. This is where things went wrong: Sitting in our sweaty and smoke-smelling clothes in the bus, a fire alarm went on in the bus toilet - NOT caused by us 😊. The Bus pulled over, and a few minutes later it was burning with meter high flames flickering in the sky. Not only did we miss our connecting train to Tampere, but also lost all our backpacking gear which burned to ash in the luggage compartment of the bus.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40820173553/in/dateposted/" title="And it burns, burns, burns"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40820173553_4eacfc83e0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="And it burns, burns, burns" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I still loved hiking, and so decided to buy with the insurance money new backpacking gear. But I remembered that carrying 20+ kg on my back didn’t add to a pleasurable experience, and so, little by little, I found out that <a href="">ultralight backpacking</a> was a thing. So why the blog?</p>

<p>Back then the Summit &amp; Valley blog, <a href="http://www.christownsendoutdoors.com">Chris Townsend</a> and a few others were a huge inspiration for me to start blogging. I enjoyed the accounts of Bristish backpackers going out into the hills and documenting their trips, and as I felt there was no blog documenting the hiking and backpacking possibilities in Finland I registered the Hiking in Finland domain without much thought for a brand name or such. I published trip reports, gear reviews, and even made videos back in 2009 already, though they were quite different from what I produce nowadays. Together with Roger, Joe, Jörgen, Martin and Gustav we founded <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nordiclightpacking/">Nordic Lightpacking</a> and even got together to go <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/06/the-ul-fellowship.html">backpacking in Vålådalen</a> in 2010.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/46997178644/in/dateposted/" title="Ultralight Backpackers!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46997178644_a578059447_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ultralight Backpackers!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Things took off for me well and magazines and companies started to ask if I could write and photograph for them. As the financial crisis from 2008 still made my work as an environmental management consultant quite hard, I decided to switch careers and have been working in this content creation, photography and outdoor business since 2011 full-time. Without this blog that wouldn’t have happened, and the amazing readers and friends I made during the last ten years helped me a lot so that I can work on my own with amazing outdoor brands, creating inspiring content from Northern Europe and across the globe. So thank you to the millions of readers who have read my articles over the last decade - it’s because of you that I am able to live this life!</p>

<h2 id="hiking-climbing-skiing">Hiking, Climbing, Skiing</h2>

<p>… as well as Packrafting, bikepacking and trailrunning are what I do mostly nowadays. Quickly I realized that limiting myself to only hiking would mean I’d sit six months a year inside, so on came the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2011/01/backcountry-cross-country-skiing.html">XC skis</a> in winter, and since four years I also go ski touring in Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the Alps. With over 180.000 Lakes in Finland the addition of a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/08/packrafting-in-finland-first-strokes.html">packraft</a> was a logical first step, and also <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/06/bikepacking-in-pirkanmaa.html">bikepacking</a> felt like a good way to explore my surroundings.</p>

<p>I was dabbling for some years in climbing but because of having small kids I never was able to train as much as I wanted, so lately I haven’t been climbing on ice or rocks that much, but with the kids growing fast I hope to get back into that activity at some point. I did pick up <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning</a> to stay fit as I can easily go run from the front of my house, and it is an activity which also gives me a good fitness for backpacking. Yes, backpacking, the activity of hiking and camping in nature, is still one of the best things in life. Even better, I am fortunate enough to call this work, mainly because I carry a camera, tripod and notepad with me when I go out, and am able to create compelling stories, photos and videos about my trips. It is something I truly love, because not only do I know that spending time is nature is healthy in many ways, it also inspires people to protect our planet better.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>

<p><em>What is next?</em> you might think, and it is a good question. Ten years ago I already started to write and talk about the negative effects of climate change, but society was not ready for it. Now, in 2019, thanks to a 16-year old girl and the movement she has inspired, old politicians finally start to listen up and ponder the future of the human species and the planet (though I feel these old politicians simply will continue business-as-usual). I feel the time is right now for me to again start talking about how we outdoor enthusiasts can do small things which can make this planet better - from picking up other people’s trash which we find on the trail to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/03/urban-family-transportation.html">cycling more</a>, eating healthier and flying less.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40820176023/in/dateposted/" title="Dusk"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40820176023_5b9c8da3ba_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dusk" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As you might have seen on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hendrikmorkel">Youtube</a> I enjoy making videos again, and most of my reviews and trips will feature a video. I love the creativity video allows me, both in shooting and editing, and it is something that I feel better communicates what I want to say. Don’t worry, this blog will not go away. I see this blog as my home base, a sustainable and lasting place for the content I create, from the much-loved <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/the-week-in-review/">The Week In Review</a> to trip reports and other content series. As I hate Instagram and equally despise Facebook I will spend less time on these necessary evils, but you will still be able to find me on Twitter and engage with me there. I also plan to give this blog an visual overhaul. The last one is too long ago, and I hope to find the time in 2019 to give this blog the look I wish it had. Don’t worry, it will not look like every other cookie-cutter blog out there but retain it’s quirkiness, although in a slightly less 90s-internet look 😂</p>

<p>Finally, I have to thank you, my readers, for returning for so long to read Hiking in Finland. It always makes me happy when I receive tweets, comments, Emails and messages from people who went to hike somewhere because of my trip reports, bought an item because of my review or decided to make a change because one of my ponderings. It is because of you that I create content, and it means so much to me to hear that it matters to you and that you enjoy it. Thank you for reading and following me ❤️</p>

<p>Sometime last autumn I purchased a new domain. My mind is set, I need a fresh start. After eight years of blogging at Hiking in Finland I need a new challenge. It’s a bad time to do this, but if I don’t do it not now I never might. Hiking in Finland is the most-read English-language blog from Scandinavia, there’s over 30.000 Regular Readers a month, add in the close to 20.000 Followers and Fans on the different Social Media channels and you can understand the dilemma of changing something that’s so successful and generates part of my income (Yes, I work full time on the blog since 2014).</p>

<p>Things that led to this is that I do far more nowadays than hiking in Finland - just last year I was ski-touring in Norway &amp; Switzerland, on adventure travel trips in Macedonia, Greece and Mexico, on active family holidays in Vorarlberg, backpacking in South Tyrol and cycle touring in Finland. So the name is out-dated and limits me, but I also moved away a bit from what this blog was about in the beginning - ultralight backpacking. While I maintain that Ultralight is Not Dead I also have started to look over the borders - I have entered a partnership with Helsport for example, and while I always try to carry as little as possible and use the lightest gear for the occasion it’s not the be all and end all of all things like it was more in the past.</p>

<p>But mostly I feel I have become complacent. The status quo is a dangerous place to get lazy and before other’s think <em>It’s the same old</em> I myself might just kill the status quo, reinvent and embark on a new journey. It might be rough on the edges at the beginning, some of you might not like it, but I am sure that with a new challenge I am able to grow myself and the blog to a new level that’s more creative &amp; honest.</p>

<h2 id="design-or-why-does-hif-look-not-like-it-used-to">DESIGN or why does HiF look not like it used to?</h2>
<p>Last November I managed to destroy the backend of Hiking in Finland - right before the #HiFAdventCalendar should have started and while I was in Mexico. Some bacteria or virus knocked me out for two weeks once I returned from Mexico and I barely was able to publish the daily doors on the ad-hoc blog I created. As I got healthy again I had a big hacking session and managed to get HiF back online the way you see it now - still not really how it used to look like or how I would like it to look, but better than a 404. During February and March I will try to update the layout and looks, but first there’s some other priorities.</p>

<h2 id="yeps-theres-gonna-be-a-new-blog">Yeps, there’s gonna be a new blog</h2>
<p>Hiking in Finland will continue &amp; will be regularly updated in the future, but my new website Hike Climb Travel will see a lot more action. Hike Climb Travel is much broader in name as Hiking in Finland and reflects that I do much more than hiking &amp; backpacking in Finland. Hiking in Finland will be home to my adventures at home and neighbouring countries, while Hike Climb Travel will be my outlet for everything that does take place outside of my beautiful home country. It will kick off some time in February, with a pretty, responsive layout, a great brand identity and some great stories to get you hooked. The best way to stay informed about when the new blog goes online is to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.us2.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=b29c2acd04d959eace48da780&amp;id=46b5d0326f">subscribe to the Newsletter</a> and follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hendrikmorkel">Youtube</a>, but no worries, I also will let it be known here.</p>

<p>For some time I will try to work on both blogs, but time will show if that is possible &amp; smart or if I just move everything over to the new website. Thus, if there’s a favourite article here on the Olde Blog, now is a good time to save it as a pdf for future references. Some content will will also be moved over, so no worries that it’s gonna be all lost down the aether.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32396336051/in/dateposted/" title="Staring off into the distance"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/443/32396336051_9d5ed3cd01_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Staring off into the distance" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="twir-is-not-dead">TWIR is (Not?) Dead</h2>
<p>A couple of weeks back I asked on Instagram and Facebook for one reason why you follow me and a large part of the answers included TWIR. But a lot has changed since I started The Week In Review six years ago: I got married, have two wonderful kids and a house that still needs a wee bit of renovation (not to mention the garden). I feel I have neglected my family the last years every Sunday for several hours while writing the TWIR, and with a little daughter of one year I (maybe too late) realised it is time to kill The Week in Review, reclaim my Sundays and spend them with the people that matter the most to me - my wife and kids.</p>

<p>Also, The Week In Review is a popular post but it never generated much of income for me. I tried to monetise it in some tasteful ways by affiliate links to offers that matter to you, and a couple of times the Packrafting Store sponsored an issue, but these were not putting enough €$£ into my pocket for the time I invest into the TWIR. Because I know that so many of you love the TWIR and rely on it to find new, relevant content that matters, I am open to suggestions on how we could keep the Week In Review alive - but it would be published then on Mondays as I want to have a weekend. Maybe a PayPal subscription would be an option, but that would mean some of you would need to start to pay for the TWIR content. If you think that’s something you’d be willing to do, leave a comment underneath - and also other ideas and feedback is welcome.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31674881554/in/dateposted/" title="Ice River floating"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/700/31674881554_9d690dd7bb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ice River floating" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>All in all I am very happy to have this off my chest. I felt bad leaving you loyal readers in the dark about this since last December, but now that I typed it down and re-read it a couple of times it feels good and I am happy to hit publish and see how you take these changes. Thus, comment away - here or on the Social Media channels you can find me on!</p>

    <updated>2016-11-04T23:03:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com//2016/11/blogger-communications-how-to-contact-companies</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I wrote how a company would ideally approach me if they would like to cooperate but that’s just one side of the coin. Because also bloggers reach out to companies to cooperate. How that is done professionally you read in this article.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30613973862/in/dateposted/" title="Sunset in Northern Greece"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5708/30613973862_5072194856_b.jpg" width="1024" height="340" alt="Sunset in Northern Greece" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Not only <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/blogger-communications-how-to-contact-bloggers.html">companies contact bloggers</a>, also bloggers contact companies to work together with them together. I have often contacted companies thus have plenty of experience of what is good &amp; works well, but also know from personal conversations with companies &amp; agencies that not all Emails are crafted as meticulously, sometimes even bordering on the outright rude. So don’t be that blogger, remember the good manners your parents thought you and show off your best side when you contact a company when <em>you want something from them</em>. Instead of giving you a pre-made template of an Email, here are the points which I know should be in there - use them to create your own unique contact email.</p>

<h2 id="the-contact-email">The Contact Email</h2>

<p><em>Hei XYZ,</em> - Do your research and find out who would be the right person to contact. Sometimes these can be found from the company’s website, sometimes you need to hone your Search Skills and use other tools. <strong>Tip:</strong> LinkedIn can be a good way to find the right contact person in a company.</p>

<p><em>My Name is ABC and I write the GDI Blog.</em> - ALWAYS start off with an introduction. You would do this in real life when you meet someone the first time, do this also when you contact someone out of the blue. <strong>Tip:</strong> Yes, that’s a good place to put a link to your blog in there. And if you’re an Instagrammer, Youtuber or have a super-popular Maillinglist, switch blog for your medium.</p>

<p><em>I’m contacting you because…</em> - Tell them why you want to work with that company. Be creative but sensible. The person you’re writing to probably gets twenty Cooperation inquiry Emails a day, so try to stand out from the crowd. Be funny, unique, creative. This should concentrate on the company, not the product - that comes next.</p>

<p><em>I’m interested in testing your CDI trousers on my next Yukon thru-hike because…</em> - Now you pitch the product you’d like to test. Be specific in your test goal and it is good to straight away mention Size &amp; Colour you are interested in. If you’re going to “only” test the item on day hikes through your local wood that might be less attractive as a trip where the receiver can imagine that great images would come out.</p>

<p><em>I would review the pants…</em> - State what you offer for the item. Are it Instagram photos? A video? A blog post? All of that? What’s the time-frame (within 5 weeks, after 4 months, after a year)? Be as specific and detailed as possible.</p>

<p><em>Usually I charged XXX €$£ for a review, but because this is our first cooperation I’m happy to offer a Discount.</em> - Yes, even when you ask a company for an item you should name your price. You can but don’t need to offer a discount, that’s up to you. Just don’t sell yourself for free.</p>

<p><em>My Unique Readers a month are XXX and the Engagement is XXX. For detailed information, please view the attached Mediakit.</em> - The key numbers of your medium (Blog, IG, Mailinglist, etc.) should be in the Email so the receiver can have an idea of the size of your blog, while your Mediakit should be attached. If you don’t have a Mediakit attach a screenshot of your Analytics programme of the current month and name the Social Media channels you play on including numbers. And then get started on making that Mediakit!</p>

<p><em>Finally, I’m also a Signee of the <a href="http://www.outdoorbloggercodex.com/en/?noredirect=en_US">Outdoor Blogger Codex</a> and am transparent in my tests.</em> - This shows the receiver that you are working professional and adhere to legal rules &amp; requirements.</p>

<p><em>I’m looking forward to hear from you and remain with…</em> - Remember the friendly and professional attitude we mentioned at the beginning? That continues until the last sentence!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29902998894/in/dateposted/" title="Vancouver at night"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8571/29902998894_25c96d4288_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Vancouver at night" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="more-pro-tips">More Pro Tips</h2>

<p>K.I.S.S. - Keep It Short and Simple. Long Emails don’t get read, be as concise as possible - this shows you also value the time of the receiver.</p>

<p>I said it before, and I say it again: Also small blogs can contact companies for a cooperation because they can offer unique perspectives or a high engagement with their readers. If you just started a blog - don’t worry, you’re probably creating great content with a unique view, so don’t be shy!</p>

<p>If your blog is really outstanding - like it has won meaningful Awards - you can mention this. It should be something the receiver is familiar with.</p>

<p>Have you worked already with other brands together? Great! Mention a partner or two (preferably not from the same category - If you have tested trousers from company JKL and wrote a glowing review and now ask for another pair of trousers that might seem strange) as this shows that you’re a trust-worthy blogger that delivers what he promises.</p>

<p>If it is a product that has just been announced at a trade show chances are that there’s no samples yet, or very limited ones. Generally I have the feeling that companies prefer to have their new products reviewed, so if you ask to test a five-year old Bestseller that has won Magazine Awards your chances are very slim. In that case you’re better off pitching a cooperation to an outdoor shop.</p>

<p>Speaking of outdoor shops, these can be great cooperation partners. Emails to them are similar as this one and you can adapt these ideas just a little to get your foot into the door.</p>

<p>Your complete contact details - address &amp; phone number should be in the Email, also Skype or similar. Some people prefer to pick up the phone and give you a call, plus it adds more credibility.</p>

<p>Finally, lets imagine you totally hate the product you were sent. Instead of writing a negative review you should get in touch with the company or agency, explain the situation and ask them what they think you should do. On the one side you might want to warn your readers about the product, but on the other hand it might be that you used it wrongly, it was a pre-production sample, or something else. Work out a beneficial solution out with your partner which both can life with.</p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that when you contact a company or PR Agency you should do your research well. Know who to write to, be friendly in your Email as good manners go a long way to getting you what you want, and be as concise as possible. If done well the receiver will feel lucky that just you contacted them and help them do their job better. You want to create a win-win-win situation, where the company, you and your readers benefit from this cooperation.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Popular Bloggers get daily Emails that offer them to test, promote and try products &amp; services, with the hope that we really like and write about them &amp; let you, our readers know. Sadly the majority of these Emails are so poorly constructed and researched that it is time to give PR Agencies, shops and manufacturers a hint on how to talk with us.</p>

<p>This Email and post came about as a friend asked me for advice on <em>how to contact bloggers</em>. That friends runs a small company in Germany, I have met him several times in person and have used their products (they’re one of my favourites). It’s rare that I get an Email asking me - how should I contact you if I want to cooperate with you? The majority of Email writers assumes I have just been waiting for them and their AwesomeOutdoorProduct, not knowing it existed in the first place. I’ve studied at the University a Master’s Degree where I learned about doing my research, so if I dive into something I research that topic in-depth and try to know as much as possible about it. This is what I expect from people contacting me, too.</p>

<p>But back to that Email to my friend. Here’s what I told him, published in public so that other companies can up their game and also that fellow bloggers have something they can refer companies to when they receive a bad Email.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-contact-bloggers">How to contact bloggers</h2>

<p>As a company I only would cooperate with bloggers which have signed the <a href="http://www.outdoorbloggercodex.com/en/?noredirect=en_US">Outdoor Blogger Codex</a>. This are bloggers which work transparent, adhere to legal requirements and are honest to their readers. They’re also pretty good bloggers that write about authentic experiences and are not afraid to write if something was sub-par. Most of all these bloggers try to work as professionally as possible, even if their blog is only a hobby, which means partners can expect a certain level of professionalism.</p>

<p>So after you have browsed the Outdoor Blogger Codex and have found a blogger you think is a good fit, the important part starts: Research. Find out which Social Media Channels the blogger uses, if she was somewhere just on tour, what was her last Instagram Story, etc. The more you find out about the blogger before writing that first Email the better. Then it’s time to draft that Email which aims to make a good impression and offer something from which both parties can benefit. It could look something like this:</p>

<hr />

<p><br />
<em>Hei Hendrik,</em></p>

<p><em>my name is XYZ and I work for AwesomeOutdoorBrand. While doing research about the topic of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/05/lyngen.html">ski-touring in Lyngen</a> I found your article and I thought your photos &amp; story from that trip were really great. We, AwesomeOutDoorBrand, produce an GreatOutdoorProduct and would like it if you’d feel like taking it along on your next ski-tour and also test it as extensively and write about it as you did with [<a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">Mention suitable &amp; similar article or review</a>].</em></p>

<p><em>We know that bloggers invest a lot of time and enthusiasm into their articles and we would pay you in addition to the GreatOutdoorProduct which you’re allowed to keep also XXX €£$, as you probably already have some GreatOutdoorProducts in your gear closet - but those one can’t eat, as we know. Of course you’d have full editorial control in your texts, and we love to also hear constructive critiscm - because even if we try to make a perfect product it might not suit you, and probably there’s always something that can be improved. Time-wise we would like to possibly read something in three to four months from you as it takes time to test equipment as in-depth as you do.</em></p>

<p><em>When the article is online and it fits our Social Media Guidelines we also would like to share it on our channels, as we’re sure our Fans would be curious to read what you think about our GreatOutdoorProduct. And if you love our GreatOutdoorProduct we also could talk about a long-term partnership, if we both have the feeling that we fit well together. I’m looking forward to hear from you and remain with</em></p>

<p><em>Happy trails,</em></p>

<p><em>*XYZ</em></p>

<h2 id="the-thinking-that-went-into-that-email">The thinking that went into that Email</h2>

<p>As bloggers we do like it if people read our articles, so referencing something we have published is a great opener. Just please really read the article and not just look for a suitable headline.</p>

<p>We get daily offers to test something, of which I delete 95% as they’re not on topic (I would not be able to credibly review something that doesn’t fit in with the topic of my blog). If one contacts a blogger make sure the topic is in lines with the blog’s - for me that’d be <em>Outdoor Adventure Travel</em> by fair means.</p>

<p>The payment for the work should be appropriate - that is generally everything from 150€ upwards. That might appear like a lot, but for a good review one might need three or more days - producing good photos, writing &amp; researching the text, and testing the product in its intended environment.</p>

<p>Reach is important (you can <a href="http://brandsome.fi/brand/hikinginfinland">see Hiking in Finland’s current Social Media Reach here</a>) and it’s clear most companies want to reach as many people as possible. However, one should not rule out working with smaller blogs that maybe are just starting out - they can have an even better engagement as large blogs, and are a great possibility to maybe work with the Digital Influencer of tomorrow.</p>

<p>Also feel free to ask for the Mediakit - every good blogger should have one and if not should have no problem with sending you a current screenshot of Google Analytics or similar.</p>

<p>Of course one doesn’t need to offer something in the first Email at all, butt as many bloggers have a job, family and limited time it might be good to come directly to the point instead of asking for a Mediakit. After all there’s tools out there that lets one find out <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/">how many visitors a blog has</a> and while these are not always accurate they give you an idea.</p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is to research before you contact, communicate on the same level with the person you’re writing to and treat their time as valuable. Nothing is more annoying than a copy &amp; pasted, standardised Email which has nothing to do with what I do and wastes my time.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29902999164/in/dateposted/" title="Coffee"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8640/29902999164_eb71cd2dfc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Coffee" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I’ll write more about the topic of how to cooperate with bloggers in the future, if you’re able to read German you might want to already read <a href="http://ulligunde.com/2016/03/zum-umgang-mit-bloggern-teil-1-offtopic/">Erika’s post</a> on these issues and also subscribe to the <a href="http://blogchamps.de">BlogChamps</a> Newsletter (again, in German).</p>

<p><strong>Got an utterly bad example of an Wanna-test-this? Email?</strong> Share it in the comments!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve never been a big fan of Wordpress, and after recent developments at Google I also would be worried of their treatment of the Blogspot platform. Personally I find WordPress bloated, not easy to work with and I dislike the online editor with a passion. And with Google shutting down services or integrating them with Google+ the future of Blogspot looks uncertain, too. Time to look at alternatives which give you full control of your content, <em>all the time.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8695803586/" title="Rain by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8546/8695803586_29bf710398_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Rain" /></a></p>

<h2 id="nothing-is-free">Nothing is Free</h2>

<p>We happily are reaching a time where people are realising that <em>free on the internet</em> comes at a cost. With Google, Facebook and the like that cost means that your data is sold to advertisers, and that these companies, whose services you’re using <em>for free</em> can do with your content on their platforms almost as they see fit. Yes, you have some rights, but they seem to be getting less and less. While your website or blog might just be a hobby in which you chronicle your outdoor adventures (insert other pastime which people write online about), or if it is more, like your online business card that you use to attract clients, I wouldn’t want that another company has control over it. That was one of the reasons why <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/07/welcome-to-the-new-hikinginfinland-dot-com.html">I switched last year to Octopress</a>.</p>

<p>Whenever possible I try to pay for a service I use. As a paying client you have more rights than someone who is using a service for free. I pay for all my URLs, I pay for my GoSquared Analytics, I pay for Flickr where I host my photos, I paid for the Text Editors which I use to write my articles, I paid for the RSS Reeder I use to read all my subscriptions (and will pay for <a href="https://feedbin.me/">feedbin.me</a> when I move away from Google Reader soon), I pay for Vimeo where I host my videos, I paid for the different software programmes I use to edit videos and photos, and while my Github hosting is free I’d pay for it in a second (I bought some <a href="http://shop.github.com/">T-Shirts</a> to support them in another way). Also Octopress is free, but again, I’d happily pay for it or will buy some swag/ tip the creator when these options become available. Services that I use for the site, but don’t pay for, are Disqus for comments and Cloudflare for security, as my site is too small to pay for these two just yet. If you pay for a service, you have rights. You can complain if something doesn’t work, you reward the people who spent weeks of their life to create the service you use, you ensure future updates, bug fixes and improvements.</p>

<p>If you use something for free, you don’t have a right to complain about it. So while some blogging platforms are free, if the company owning them decides to shut them down or use your content in another way than you intended, because you use the service for free you have little reason to complain about it - after all, you did not pay for it. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/12/posterous-finds-a-home-in-the-arms-of-twitter/">It’s not like this hasn’t happened before</a>.</p>

<p>Right. Now we can look at the two tools which you’ll need to start blogging from any device while owning your content all the time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zzpza/3269784239/" title="Tools by zzpza, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3517/3269784239_e208c5b968_o.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Tools" /></a>

<h2 id="dropbox">Dropbox</h2>

<p><a href="http://db.tt/nT9WSdc">Dropbox</a> is a superb service. Basically it is a hard drive that’s <em>in the cloud</em> and which you can access from everywhere - your smartphone, tablet, own laptop or a computer at the public library. The basic account is free and gives you 2 GB space, which is plenty if you only store text files on it. I have a Premium account with a bit more space, and I save all my blogging related data in a folder on it. It’s a superb service you should use, even if you’re not blogging.</p>

<h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> “<em>is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).</em>” I write all my posts in Markdown. It is indeed a lot easier than writing in HTML (which I can do, but I find it more suitable for coding than for writing content) and thus is likely for those who find HTML tags et al. confusing a far superior solution. If you can type on a computer, then you can write in Markdown.</p>

<p>However, you might need a new Text Editor which allows you to save your texts in Markdown - I use <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> which has a free evaluation copy, and <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/mac/">iWriter</a> which costs about $5. Both are superb and I can highly recommend both. And here’s a <a href="http://warpedvisions.org/projects/markdown-cheat-sheet/">Markdown cheat sheet</a> to get you started.</p>

<p>These are all the tools you need to start blogging on one of the following platforms. Let’s have a look at the options.</p>

<h2 id="dropbox-based-blogs">Dropbox Based Blogs</h2>

<p>I think I made that term up, but it describes the underlying principle very well: You write your posts in Markdown, save them in a folder on your Dropbox, and then depending on the service you either need to <em>refresh</em> your blog or need to do nothing at all for the new post to appear online. You can write and post your Dropbox based blog from your computer, tablet or smartphone - just make sure that the Text Editor you’re using saves your posts in your Dropbox folder in Markdown format. It’s super simple, and because you save your content in your Dropbox, you own the content.</p>

<p>What follows are the six services I am aware of that offer these Dropbox Based Blogs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8215228520/" title="Scriptogr.am by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8478/8215228520_8ed8128c1b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="640" alt="Scriptogr.am" /></a></p>

<h2 id="scriptogram">Scriptogr.am</h2>

<p><a href="http://scriptogr.am/">Scriptogr.am</a> is made by a small Swedish team in Stockholm and was the first of the Dropbox Blogs that I became aware of. I run my <a href="http://hendrikmorkel.com/">personal blog</a> on it and like it very much. It looks great on smartphone, tablets and computers, and is very easy to tweak if you don’t like the minimalistic look - you should be familiar with CSS and HTML in that case, though. It has no comments, but you can host it on your own url.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8214143025/" title="Calepin.co by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8482/8214143025_b581d31cc0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="640" alt="Calepin.co" /></a></p>

<h2 id="calepinco">Calepin.co</h2>

<p><a href="http://calepin.co/">Calepin.co</a> has a few more features that scriptogr.am, namely Disqus comments, an RSS feed and can easily be linked to your Twitter account. You also can host it on your own url by entering your CNAME record. The service explains itself very well on its page, and is very open about its ambitions (namely they aim to make it a paid service in the future). Overall I think this might be the best option for many (outdoor) bloggers, as it allows comments, is responsive and integrates with Twitter. There’s a <a href="http://jokull.calepin.co/calepin-guide.html">good guide</a>, too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8215228142/" title="Skrivr.com by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8480/8215228142_0092dc2460_b.jpg" width="1024" height="640" alt="Skrivr.com" /></a></p>

<h2 id="skrivr">Skrivr</h2>

<p><a href="http://skrivr.com/">Skrivr</a> looks very good, is also responsive (so looks great on smartphones, tablets and computers), is Made in Sweden and it will be a Premium service when it launches. At the moment you need to ask for an invite to use the service. It automatically publishes content you save to its Dropbox folder, allows for own urls but seems to lack comments. Check out their <a href="http://skrivr.com/blog/">blog</a> to see how it looks, and <a href="http://skrivr.com/#signup">request an invite</a> if you like Skrivr.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8695907880/" title="Marquee by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8261/8695907880_c60b834376_b.jpg" width="1024" height="640" alt="Marquee" /></a></p>

<h2 id="marquee">Marquee</h2>

<p><a href="http://marquee.by/">Marquee</a> started as a Dropbox Based blog service but has evolved since. At the moment it’s invite only, and it looks like it will be a web based service (so you write and edit in your browser). It does look very nice - check the animation they have on their site if you’re interested - but I can’t say more about it at the moment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8695913102/" title="Markbox by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8119/8695913102_bd944e4326_b.jpg" width="1024" height="640" alt="Markbox" /></a></p>

<h2 id="markbox">Markbox</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.markbox.io//">Markbox</a> is the fifth option, and also looks superb. It publishes new content automatically, though you can hit “Publish” if you’re impatient. It has a responsive design and is Made in the USA.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8214142129/" title="GoDrop.it by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8346/8214142129_672517a607_b.jpg" width="1024" height="640" alt="GoDrop.it" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://godrop.it/">GoDrop.it</a> has closed, but since users had all their content on their Dropbox they could just sign up to one of the above services and continue blogging. Beautiful!</p>

<h2 id="exporting-content">Exporting content</h2>

<p><em>Good. I’m convinced. Where do I sign up?</em> Great. If you want a fresh start and a new blog, just head to one of the services, link your Dropbox to it and start writing in Markdown. If you have been blogging for years and amassed hundreds of posts, exporting each manually is a lot of work. Help comes in the form of <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations">migration tools</a>. You’ll need to get a bit techy or ask a computer savvy mate to help you out (take him for an ultralight hike with Pizza &amp; Beers afterwards as a Thank You!). If you want to move <a href="http://bentsai.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/from-wordpress-to-markdown-calepin/">from WP to Calepin</a> that’s a good read, as is <a href="http://lbolla.info/blog/2012/11/12/wordpress-to-markdown">this one</a>. Don’t worry, this is the only “<em>difficult</em>” part of moving away from Blogger and Wordpress!</p>

<h2 id="importing-content">Importing content</h2>

<p>If you have all your old posts saved to your hard drive in Markdown, you should check a few to see if everything got exported correctly. Especially if you have not embedded photos but uploaded them to WP or Blogger you’ll need to go back and add the photos I imagine - another reason to outsource that to a dedicated photo hosting service and to embed photos in the future!</p>

<p>So if everything looks good, you just copy and past the files into the posts folder in your Dropbox and then, depending on the service you chose, wait till they publish them automatically or go to your Dashboard and hit publish. <strong>Congratulations, you have now moved away from Wordpress or Blogger and own all your content! Happy blogging in Markdown =)</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8694813147/" title="Migration tools by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8399/8694813147_bdd794370a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="640" alt="Migration tools" /></a></p>

<h2 id="liner-notes">Liner Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>But Hendrik, some of those Dropbox Blogs are <strong>FREE</strong>! What now?</em> Don’t despair. Some of the services have addressed this, and likely are going to offer paid versions in the future. In case you’re not willing to pay, moving away from one service to another one is easy because you own all your content in a very simple, open format (Markdown) so if one service disappoints you, you can move to the next one with only a few clicks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In case it all sounded like you’ll need to be a nerd, don’t worry. It’s easy as pie to start blogging in the above way, and in comparison to WP and Blogger there’s only benefits to using these platforms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know there’s thousands of people who enjoy Wordpress and are very happy with it. Wordpress.com and Wordpress.org both have their place in blogging land, and if you’re with the former and pay you’re probably on good ground and know what you’re doing. I myself write on a few other sites via WP and while I still dislike it, it does the job. But I find php $!#% and hence rather wouldn’t want to work with it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for Blogspot, with Google continuously shutting down services or integrating them with Google+ I imagine we might see the service being integrated with G+ at some point. This is pure speculation on my part, so don’t get hysterical just yet. Again, there’ thousands of great blogs on Blogspot, so if you feel good there, carry on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What all the platforms above have in common is that they are very minimalistic. There is usually no sidebar and pages, but an archive. I’m sure if you know HTML &amp; CSS you’d be able to create these, or maybe they will be on the roadmap for the services in the future. But then that’s one of their charms: They’re simple, fast and the focus is on the content and not other stuff around it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have used Blogger for years and found it good back then. With an increased interest in technology I started to find things which I didn’t appreciate, hence I moved to Octopress, which I find absolutely superb. The “Problem” with Blogger is at the moment that Google owns it, and hence they might decide to do something that’s more in line with their strategy. Just to recap: They shut down/ will be shutting down Feedburner and Google Reader in the next months, both services with millions of users and dearly loved by their users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am and have been writing on Wordpress. There’s even a <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-markdown/">Markdown Plugin for Wordpress</a>. But I find the backend editor just a pain to use, and <a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">php just sucks</a>. If I can, I always avoid it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s lots of great looking and fast Blogger &amp; Wordpress blogs out there. I read many of them. If you’re happy, and couldn’t care less who owns your content, just carry on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to switch to one of the above services, don’t jump the ship and delete your old blog right away. Read the tutorials on how to set it up, test it, see how you like it, and if you find it good get all your content over to the new blog. If you run into problems, consult Google Search - chances are your problem has been encountered before, and hopefully solved as well.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Nothing is free. If you enjoyed this article you can <a href="https://holvi.com/shop/hikinginfinland/product/dd006c907dfc0805441be88068460867/">buy me a coffee or two</a> to ensure more quality content in the future.</em></p>
