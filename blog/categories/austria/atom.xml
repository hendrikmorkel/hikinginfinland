<p>Last Monday was a travel day. Last Tuesday was a powder day. Life is good, right until when it is not good anymore.</p>

<p>The TransAlp sounded like an Event that was made for me: A traverse of three countries on ski, from Livigno in Italy to the Kleinwalsertal in Austria via Switzerland. It’s exactly the kind of trips I enjoy and look for, so the invitation to the adventure from <a href="https://www.marker.net/de/">Marker</a>, <a href="https://www.dalbello.it/">Dalbello</a> and <a href="https://www.voelkl.com/">Völkl</a> was after a bit of pondering and some questions quickly decided upon.</p>

<p>What I couldn’t be aware of was that a flu I had decided to trouble me up at almost 3.000 m up in the Alps, and slow me down quite a bit in comparison with my more skilled tour partners.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not far away from the busy streets of Munich you can find Austrian hospitality, empty mountains full of powder snow and warm Saunas to relax in after a day of skiing. After the ISPO I went to the Salzburger Lungau region with my brother and enjoyed a few relaxed days in this hidden gem of Austria, enjoying an untracked experience.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40608666222/in/dateposted/" title="Snowy me"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4653/40608666222_60551ec0d7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snowy me" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.lungau.at">Salzburger Lungau</a> Region is a mere couple of hours away from Munich, and unless you try to drive there on the start of some German holiday you can be in as little as one and half hours by car from Munich in the Lungau - in our case we stayed in the picturesque village of St. Margarethen in the <a href="https://www.grizzly-resort.at">Grizzly Resort Sport Hotel</a>, which is located at the base of the ski slopes. The Hotel staff expected us much later and was surprised when we walked in a bit before 20 o’clock! We checked into our rooms, had a quick shower and then it was down to the restaurant to enjoy some tasty Austrian food.</p>

<p>After Dinner I went out to photograph the stars, but soon I was so cold that I wanted to only get back inside and sleep! And as we had a long day in front of us, that’s what I did!</p>

<h2 id="ski-touring-to-the-seekpfl">Ski-touring to the Seeköpfl</h2>

<p>The next morning <a href="http://www.geführte-skitouren.at">Albert Essl</a> picked us up at the Hotel. We met Albert already two years ago when we were visiting the Salzburger Lungau in 2016 and enjoyed his guiding and company, so it was great to meet him again and go for a ski tour together.</p>

<p>Albert picked for us an easy tour for our first day, to the beautiful Seeköpfl summit. We started at a parking lot where we left the car and after a few hundred meters of walking we were stepping into our bindings and beginning to skin up. Over a narrow road we ascended deep into the forest. I really like the skinning up part of ski-touring, it’s relaxing and enjoyable for me to skin up through the forest, observe how the trees get fewer and fewer and then coming out into the open, with wide, majestic views in all directions. We were very lucky with the weather, too: Sunshine and a blue sky - it was a perfect day.</p>

<p>After a couple of hours we stood at the summit of the Seeköpfl, the sun shining down on us. We were happy, it was a beautiful day, we were outside in nature, and now a nice descent waited for us - or so we thought! The ride down was pretty icy with only a few patches of good snow, and at the end there were the dreaded narrow and icy forest roads back to the car. Ah well, there was snow in the forecast so it will be better soon!</p>

<p>After the skiing part of the day my brother and me quickly developed a good routine: Chilling on the rooms for a bit‚ then down to the Sauna, then getting dressed and off to Dinner. It was a pretty good Sauna at the Hotel, and it’s nice that in the Southern countries they often have a wee Bar with juices, water, nuts and tea where you can drink &amp; eat a bite during Sauna turns.</p>

<h2 id="skiing-on-the-katschberg-aineck">Skiing on the Katschberg-Aineck</h2>

<p>The next morning I looked out of the window and it was grey and white. The clouds were low and it was snowing a little, but the snow should really start dumping in the afternoon. Hence my brother and me decided to ride the <a href="http://katschi.at/pistenplaene.html">Katschberg-Aineck</a> ski slopes, and with a chair lift in front of the hotel we didn’t have a long way to get there, either! It’s a big ski region with 70 km of slopes and 16 lifts, and you can have days and days of fun here. We enjoyed the A1 slope the most, as it offers some superb views on the valley, as you’ll see from the photos. A benefit of skiing on the slopes is also that you can eat in one of the huts, and it is something I always like to do, with the tasty Germknödel being my lunch of choice! Another benefit of skiing on the slopes is that you just ride down to your hotel and then can be in the Sauna in a matter of minutes 💦🔥👍</p>

<h2 id="exploring-schnfeld-and-the-nockberge">Exploring Schönfeld and the Nockberge</h2>

<p>The next morning it indeed was still dumping snow, and the forecasted 80 cm of fresh powder seemed very realistic. After a tasty breakfast we went outside to clean the car, and boy was it snowed in! After we almost dug out the car we took off towards the Nockberge, a truly hidden gem of the Salzburger Lungau.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/39940945044/in/album-72157663383796697/" title="Snow!"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4708/39940945044_b8f8c91281_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snow!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/39940953404/in/album-72157663383796697/" title="Snowy roads"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4708/39940953404_76daea129a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snowy roads" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Even when the road was cleared that same morning by the time we were on our way to the Dr. Josef-Mehrl-Hütte another 5 cm of pow ❄️❄️❄️ was on the street and my brother was concerned if we’d actually make it back - there was a rather steep road to get up on the way back. But that was none of my worry right now, I just loved the truly white and snowy surroundings we were in.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40650309221/in/album-72157663383796697/" title="Snowy rivver"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4758/40650309221_8dbff37f6f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snowy rivver" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We made it to the beautiful Dr. Josef-Mehrl-Hütte, parked the car and stepped into our bindings. Our goal was the Matehanshöhe, another easy tour, and given that there was a high Avalanche Danger with the fresh snow we wanted something that was safe and easy. The ascent went for the first part via the closed ski slope and then along a ridge till the summit, though as my brother is not used to so deep powder we decided to cut the tour a bit short, not make for the summit and head back down and enjoy the powder!</p>

<p>After the trip we enjoyed a lunch of Kaiserschmarrn at the hut before safely making it back to the Hotel in the afternoon, with plenty of time to pack, go to the Sauna and enjoy Dinner. Alas, this was our last evening together, and our short trip to the beautiful mountains of Austria were almost over again. I guess we’ll return again, as there’s still so many powdery summits and beautiful views we’d like to see!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-there-and-where-to-stay">How to get there and where to stay</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.lungau.at/en/service/arrival/">travel by train and bus to the Salzburger Lungau</a> to it is the most easiest to arrive by car. A rental car for a week can cost around as little as 120€ and allows you to get around really easy in the region, which is almost mandatory if you want to go ski-touring.</p>

<p>There’s <a href="http://booking.lungau.at/lungau/en/accommodation/list?customHeader=true">over 700 accommodation options</a> in the Salzburger Lungau, with something for every budget level (<em>It makes sense to check out the <a href="https://www.lungau.at/en/accommodation/package-offers/">Package Offers</a> where you often can safe quite nicely</em>). We stayed at the <a href="https://www.grizzly-resort.at/hotel/">Grizzly Resort Sport Hotel</a>, a very relaxed and high-quality 4 ⭐️ Hotel right next to the ski slopes. We can completely recommend the hotel with its tasty breakfast buffet, relaxing Spa &amp; Sauna, comfortable and spacious rooms and delicious 3-Course Menus in the evening.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After the ISPO I did the only smart thing: Leave the city behind and head to Austria to go ski-touring. These are some first impressions from a too-short trip to the Salzburger Lungau Region.</p>

<p>After a very busy fair I met my brother and we made the trip down south to the <a href="https://www.lungau.at/en/your-lungau/15-villages/?_wb=en/your-lungau/15-villages/&amp;lang=EN">Salzburger Lungau</a> Region, a place we have visited before and really liked. We arrived at our <a href="https://www.grizzly-resort.at">Hotel</a>, had a tasty dinner and then it was off to bed as early in the morning we would meet Albert again, our <a href="http://www.geführte-skitouren.at">Ski-touring Guide</a> with whom we had the pleasure to go skiing already in the past.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25225601117/in/dateposted/" title="Start of the tour."><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4770/25225601117_d228306e86_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Start of the tour." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Albert had two other clients along and our little group was great, we had a lot of fun on the ascent and descent. It was a beautiful sunny day with great views - just the snow could have been a wee bit better.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25225603587/in/dateposted/" title="Through the less-than-perfect snow down."><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4761/25225603587_f2d6bb985b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Through the less-than-perfect snow down." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The view from the Hotel wasn’t bad at all, either. We witnessed the #SuperBlueMoon rising behind the forest as we sat in the Sauna, not a bad place at all!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25225606417/in/dateposted/" title="Timelapse."><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4673/25225606417_0a106ea3e0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Timelapse." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The next day we hot the slopes. With a big ski resort right in front of the hotel it was not a long approach, and the skiing was good - though I really prefer soft snow on wild mountains. A good thing that a 80 cm dump of powder was forecast for the next day!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25225605937/in/dateposted/" title="Snow?

<p>And so my brother and me headed again to the secluded Thomatal Valley and started from the Dr. Josef-Mehrl Hütte up into the mountains, not to be disappointed by the amount of snow.</p>

<h2 id="a-panorama-hike-in-the-brandnertal">A Panorama Hike in the Brandnertal</h2>

<p>Where did I leave off? Ah yeah, that I just came back to our apartment after my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-vorarlberg.html">Sunrise hike up the Kanisfluh</a>, ready for a day full of family adventures. With such a good weather forecast - the first really sunny day during our stay - we decided to head to the neighbouring Brandnertal¹ and hike on the family-friendly <a href="https://www.vorarlberg-alpenregion.at/brandnertal/bergbahnen/angebot-am-berg/naturspruengeweg/">Natursprünge-Weg Brandnertal</a>. After a drive of a bit over an hour we arrived in Studa and took the Dorfbahn up the mountain. There we switched into the Panoramabahn which brought us over to the start of the nature experience trail, which has been created in cooperation with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-vorarlberg.html">inatura museum</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29538786880/in/dateposted/" title="Up with the cable car"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7569/29538786880_53f3da0611_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Up with the cable car" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But first it was already again lunch time, and so we sat down at <a href="http://www.frööd.at">Frööd</a> and ate to strengthen us for the stroll through the mountains. The food was tasty, as were their home-made lemonades, and the playground keeps kids active for a long time! Add in great views and you might just be inclined to sit on the terrace and sip cold drinks!</p>

<p>But we weren’t there to sit out a sunny day on a terrace and so we soon started to hike on the interactive Natursprünge Weg. In regular distances you find information stations which explain a certain topic - from the views over geology to respect for nature, it’s a wide array of topics which you can find out about.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29748736891/in/dateposted/" title="Natursprünge-Weg Brandnertal"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8033/29748736891_dcb20ae59d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Natursprünge-Weg Brandnertal" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29538775480/in/dateposted/" title="German, English, Dutch"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8176/29538775480_f2db5f157b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="German, English, Dutch" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>It was a wide, hard path which was OK to walk - the views were spectacular, though on a sunny day the lack of shadow could be causing trouble when on the trail with little kids, so always bring enough water, a longsleeved shirt and pants and a sun hat to protect the little hikers. Also the relative long distance (it’s around 90 minutes walking time with kids, so maybe close to 6 km) could be a problem, as there’s no shortcut. However, you can loan a handcart from the second station which would allow you to pull your kids down the trail, making it easier!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29748739211/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Eagle"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8547/29748739211_5daac6f772_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Eagle" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29748740181/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Barefoot trail at the end of the Natursprünge-Weg Brandnertal"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7523/29748740181_ab82290f79_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Barefoot trail at the end of the Natursprünge-Weg Brandnertal" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At the end we passed another Restaurant and the start of a Barefoot Trail which looked pretty nice, but we just went straight for the cable car as our little one was getting pretty tired and needed to get into bed soon! All in all the Natursprünge Trail was a good experience, but we did like the Panorama Trail in Bezau (read about it underneath) more as it was a lot prettier.</p>

<h2 id="a-barefoot-hike-in-bizau">A Barefoot Hike in Bizau</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bizau-bregenzerwald.com/sommer/sport-freizeit/wandern/barfussweg/">Barfußweg Bizauer Moos</a> is a great little hike for friends of barefoot walking! It was also very close to our <a href="http://www.appartements-wuestner.at">apartment in Mellau</a> - a short bus ride from Mellau to Bizau and we could start! We followed the trail markers over narrow paths and wider streets to the start of the barefoot trail, which runs all the time along the short (or through) the little Ulve creek which finds its way through the highmoor.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29538800070/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Kanisfluh"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8208/29538800070_9ceeae31bd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Kanisfluh" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Once we reached it we told our four year old son that we will now continue without shoes. He was highly sceptical and needed some serious convincing, but after he saw that mom and dad were walking through the muddy puddles he was all in favour of barefoot hiking! The barefoot trail runs mostly on grassy trails, with a few crossings of the ice-cold creek.</p>

<p>Our son really liked the ice-cold crossings, and loved it even more if he could make dad cross the creek twice =) The highmoor is beautiful, with colourful wildflowers all around and great views on the surrounding mountains.</p>

<p>At the end the trail runs in tight curves there and back, but always along the little creek, sometimes now also on duckboards (which can be very slippery with wet, muddy feet!) but mostly on grassy trails. Once you see the yellow-green bench you know that you’ve made it to the end of the trail! Now it’s time to wash your feet a final time in the cold creek - hopefully you brought a towel! - and get back into your shoes (unless you’re a monkey like me and have your <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a> along!) and continue - for example towards <a href="http://www.jagdgasthaus-egender.at">Jagdgasthaus Egender</a> in Schönenbach, where you can taste the best Kässpätzle of the whole region!</p>

<h2 id="hiking-on-the-panaoramaweg-bezau">Hiking on the Panaoramaweg Bezau</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://touren.vorarlberg.travel/de/tour/wanderung/bezau-panoramaweg-baumgarten/2952601/">Panaoramaweg Bezau</a> was our absolute highlight of the trip to the Bregenzerwald in Vorarlberg. It was again very close to where we stayed in Mellau - a mere 10 minute Bus ride! - and the scenery, the lovely little path, the great Restaurant and the amazing views really made this hike stand out.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29204076584/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Up into the fog"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8016/29204076584_3ae5ea3718_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Up into the fog" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29204075504/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Lunch with a view"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8252/29204075504_3d4b5fa5e8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lunch with a view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>It started with a cable car ride up into the clouds for us four, and we took the pram along - which we then left at the Restaurant as the trail didn’t accommodate a pram (it was very washed out and there were some gates where you would have to lift it over it). We had a quick lunch - tasty soups and bread - while the clouds were racing around us. As the weather cleared up we made our first start at hiking the Panorama Trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29796027006/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="What&#x27;s that mountain there?"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7507/29796027006_3e75cd3a26_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="What&#x27;s that mountain there?" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>But then the clouds and rain came back, and so we turned around to sit it out. Good thing the restaurant has a very nice playing corner where the kids could entertain themselves =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29205364873/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Playground"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8348/29205364873_a68dd68e37_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Playground" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then the weather cleared up again and we made our second try. With rain jackets on we left the Restaurant and hiked up the narrow, washed-out trail while a little creek was flowing down. Blue sky started to gain the upper hand and the grey rain clouds moved on to other places.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29831354255/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Clearing up"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8528/29831354255_4688f96fa0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Clearing up" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The views on the trail are simply outstanding: Even on this cloudy day you could see the Alps in Switzerland, the commanding Kanisfluh which is the landmark peak of the Bregenzerwald, to the north over the low, lovely foothills of the Alps, the Allgäu and Lake Constance, and then to imposing mountains to the south. 
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29748743091/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Bodensee views"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8491/29748743091_0b35ede8a9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bodensee views" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The trail was great for kids, always interesting - from Paragliders that were taking off to sheep - and kept our son in high spirits throughout the hike.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29748743501/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Inside the Chapel"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8549/29748743501_de015822f1_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Inside the Chapel" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We had a look into the pretty Alpe Niedere chapel which was relatively new before we made the climb back towards the Restaurant and the cable car station. After an ice cream and Germknödel walked over to the cable car station and made the last cable car back to Bezau. This is a great and easy afternoon or morning out for a family with kids, even in moody weather. We felt it had all you need for a family hike: Easy access, good food for kids, a spacious changing room, an interesting trail which isn’t too long and stunning scenery.</p>

<h2 id="a-ride-with-the-wlderbhnle">A Ride with the Wälderbähnle</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://waelderbaehnle.at">Wälderbähnle</a> is what puts big smiles on kids’ faces - and adults if they’re trainspotters! My son is a big, big railroad fan and the possibility to ride on a train in great mountain scenery was a highlight for him. From the moment he woke up until we finally went to the railway station he was asking about it, and then it finally was time to climb aboard our carriage and enjoy the journey.</p>

<p>The Wälderbähnle offers two different rides: One with an old Diesel engine which runs most often and the more rare Steam Engine which pulls the eight or so carriages - including a Café! - from Bezau to Schwarzenberg through the beautiful mountains of the Bregenzerwald. We were pulled by the red Diesel engine and took a look at the Steam engine in the halls of the railway station of Bezau as we were back. It’s a short ride - the from Bezau to Schwarzenberg and back takes a bit over an hour, this includes the engine switching from one side to the other one when it goes back. All along the way you could see the mountains, crossed the Bregenzer Ache river and passed cows which were enjoying the fresh grass on the meadows along the tracks.</p>

<p>The ride was very popular with families and our carriage had at least a dozen kids between 0 and 12 in it - and as Kids under six are free of charge it’s not expensive either. You buy your ticket at the railway station in Bezau before you jump on the train, although you can <a href="http://waelderbaehnle.at/fahrplanbetrieb-preise-2016">reserve a ticket online</a> too, which is probably recommended for the days when the steam engine pulls the train.</p>

<h2 id="hiking-around-mellau">Hiking around Mellau</h2>

<p>We stayed with the Family Wüstner in Mellau, at one of their <a href="http://appartements-wuestner.at">Apartments</a> which were great for a family of four. Mellau is a small village which has everything we needed: A Supermarket for grocery shopping, very frequent bus connections to any place in the region, a cable car up the mountain, bike rentals and outdoor shops, plenty of Cafés &amp; restaurants and last, but certainly not least: A big hiking trail network. Right in front of our house started the Flusswege Path which runs along the Bregenzer Ache and explains on pretty info boards about the flora &amp; fauna of the river. At the end of the path you also can make a short stroll over to the impressive waterfall and then head back to Mellau, where one of the nice Cafés is waiting to help you with a good serving of coffee &amp; strudel =)</p>

<p>I also stole away for an evening hike up towards the Gopfberg, and again the trail started pretty much in front of our house. It was a nice walk up into the dusk and once I reached the start of the forest after all the meadows I was tempted to make a run for the summit and back, but without a headlamp on me I decided it’s smarter to simply stroll back down and watch the night fall over the small village. There is, however, the possibility to walk around the Gopfberg, something I want to do on my next trip there!</p>

<h2 id="a-visit-to-metzler-naturhautnah">A Visit to Metzler Naturhautnah</h2>

<p>When it rained just too much for a hiking trip we went and visited <a href="https://www.molkeprodukte.com">Metzler Naturhautnah</a>, a dairy farm with 100 goats and 20 cows which also produces cosmetics from the whey. We got a guided tour of the dairy and saw how tasty cheese was made, petted the goats in their adventure playground stable and then also tasted the delicious cheeses.</p>

<p>From the bus stop in Egg it is a short walk up to the farm of Family Metzler. It lays scenically up a hill with a great view of the mountains, and the buildings themselves are also aesthetically very pleasing to look at, the big stables being constructed from wood in a modern design. The tour started at the shop where the daughter in law welcomed us and showed us around, answering all our questions about cheese making, goats and cosmetic products. ly stopped, too, and so we walked through the wet and cloudy hills down to catch our bus back to Mellau =)</p>

<p>We then continued to the stable where we spent some quality time with the lovely goats, petting them and looking how they “played” around. This was great for our son, as nowadays it isn’t so often that you can get up close and friendly with a goat and other animals. Hungry we continued to the pretty Conference room slash Café where we had a super-tasty cheese lunch, with almost a dozen different cheeses and fresh bread. Once it was time to leave the rain happi</p>

<h2 id="inatura-museum">Inatura Museum</h2>

<p>The next morning it was again raining hard. Happily we had another rainy-day alternative on our list: A visit to the <a href="http://www.inatura.at/home/">inatura Erlebnis Naturschau Museum</a>. Situated in Dornbirn¹ it was an hour bus ride from Mellau to get there, but with the great local bus system it meant we jumped on just one bus and get out in Dornbirn an hour later!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29569577291/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Innatura Museum"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8088/29569577291_dd889afc82_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Innatura Museum" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Located in an old factory the museum is from the outside and inside a real pearl and such a great place to visit that we really enjoyed our time in it. From the temporary exhibition about beavers to the five permanent exhibitions, the inatura is a museum which wets the appetite of old &amp; young for knowledge and which encourages its visitors to touch and try things; especially in the Sciences Zones which one finds throughout the buildings you can see how magnetism works, play with cog wheels and see lots of fish swim happily in big tanks. Add in a nice Café, friendly &amp; helpful staff and you have a great destination to spend a rainy day and keep the kids happy!</p>

<h2 id="sunrise-hike-up-the-kanisfluh">Sunrise hike up the Kanisfluh</h2>

<p>Wednesday: Rain.
<br />Thursday: Rain. 
<br />Friday: Sunshine.</p>

<p>I guess that means I will get up at 2:30 am so I can watch the sun rise from the summit of the Kanisfluh, the landmark of the Bregenzerwald. I have seen the impressive mountain every day from Mellau &amp; our adventures there, and was eager to pay the summit a visit to enjoy the vast views from the summit. Combining it with the best light of the day was a no-brainer, and so I sneaked out of the apartment while the family continued to sleep. In the middle of the night I met mountain guide Matthias and my fellow sunrise hikers at the Tourist Office in Mellau; then we squeezed into Matthias’ car to ride to the other side of the mountain where our hike would start.</p>

<p>The stars were still out when we set off from the car, but it wasn’t long until that magic light of pre-dawn started to arrive and colour the sky into the prettiest pastel colours.</p>

<p>We reached the summit cross a mere 45 minutes after we started hiking and weren’t the only ones up there who were waiting for the sun to rise. A group of friends  which set off way before us was shivering at the cross, waiting for the warm rays of the sun to warm them up. I slipped into my puffy jacket, took my camera and looked for the best angles.</p>

<p>And then the sun came.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29024563664/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Sunrise"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7554/29024563664_3e538de954_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunrise" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We watched fascinated as the sun rose slowly over the horizon, and pastel colours slowly gave way to oranges and yellows, but before long the light of day was around us. Matthias shared a zip from his flask, and then it was time to start the descent.</p>

<p>While it would have been tempting to eat breakfast on the mountain hut close to our car I promised my family to be back for breakfast, and low &amp; behold: As I arrived back at the apartment with fresh, warm rolls from the supermarket the kids were just getting up. Over breakfast we were pondering what we should do on this beautiful, sunny day together!</p>
