<h2 id="day-1-mullerthal---blumenthal---larochette">Day 1: Mullerthal - Blumenthal - Larochette</h2>

<p>We start in Mullerthal on <a href="https://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en/fiche/walking/stage-trail-mullerthal-trail-route-3">Route 3</a> and after a while we pass the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/02/mullerthal-trail-route-2.html">Schiessent√ºmpel waterfall</a> again. We continue past it in a southern direction, climbing some stairs which take us high above the stream where we walk on a soft trail under green beech trees. It does not take long for beautiful rock formations to appear on the side of the trail, and I enjoy the view of them - it appears like a large wall, just very pretty! We cross a street and hike onwards to the Kalktuffquelle, two small pools which are ‚ÄúThe Source of the Sandstone of Luxembourg‚Äù as a sign tells. It is a pretty spot and I spend some time taking photos and videos at it - there‚Äôs a handful of brown trouts swimming in the lower pool and Martin and me try to count how many we can see.</p>

<p>The clear and turquoise water of the spring is beautiful, and we understand why this is a popular spot amongst locals and hikers alike. Right now we have the place for ourselves, and no one is there to share it with us.</p>

<p>After many long exposure photos and videos we continue on the trail to Blumenthal, this time on a wooden bridge which runs next to the ‚Äú<em>Black Ernz</em>‚Äù stream. As it has been raining the wooden planks are unbelievably slippery and we are very careful while hiking over them, sort of relieved when we reach the end and hike up into the forest again.</p>

<p>At the small Rippsmuer Swamp there‚Äôs a big wooden table and benches, and as we picked up some Picnic goodies from the <a href="https://www.mullerthal-millen.lu/en/touristcenter/picnic">Heringer Millen Tourist Centre</a> in the morning we have a long and relaxed lunch - it‚Äôs even not raining, so we enjoy the good food we carried along. After Lunch we take a look at the small swamp, but as it is autumn there‚Äôs not much to be seen in terms of flowers and insects.</p>

<p>The trail continues on a forest road and we avoid large puddles of water along the tracks, but soon we‚Äôre back in the forest on a dry single trail. We make the small detour to the sun dial up on a cliff, but with the absence of the sun - it‚Äôs cloudy and grey - we simply continue hiking.</p>

<p>Green and wet beech trees surround us, and it is calm. There‚Äôs an occasional bird song, but mainly we only hear our own steps and the wind when it goes through the leafs of the trees. Along the ground we can see toadstools with their red heads and white dots on them through the ferns and undergrowth, and then it does not take long and we hike through a steep ravine down to the village of Blumenthal.</p>

<p>We cross the busy road next to the Black Ernz stream, and on the other side have again a short break. I do some stretching as I had some pain in my foot, but after taking off my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/03/all-the-shoes.html">shoes</a> and air my feet I feel better and can continue. A trailrunner overtakes us on the path, which runs next to a meadow. Then the trail takes a turn to the right and climbs up into the forest, just to spit us out into a field, where we continue. We reach a pair of trees - an Apple and a Walnut tree, which are the highest point of today and are at the Houbierg view point. We can see Berdorf and its water tower in the distance.</p>

<p>On small tracks we walk between the fields and keep an eye out for the signs here in the open, but miss one and make a small detour before we find back on the track. Along the way we did pick some very tasty apples from a tree, a tasty snack and available in abundance in this region!</p>

<p>Soon we pass through the tiny village of Soup, and in this grey weather a warm soup would have been welcome! We‚Äôre now only concentrating on reaching Larochette - a view on the weather forecast says it might start to rain any time soon, and we‚Äôd rather avoid getting soaking wet. The next bit of trail is pretty, especially the sections which take us through a beautiful green tree tunnel and then high above the town of Larochette, from where we observe the castle which towers above it.</p>

<p>We hike down into the town, along the square and continue onwards to the <a href="https://youthhostels.lu/en/youth-hostels/youth-hostel-larochette">Larochette Youth Hostel</a>, which is located in a beautiful blue building not far from the centre of the village. We moved into our small apartment, and the usual spreading out of all gear so that it can dry, a warm shower and putting on the clean clothes which were waiting for us, thanks to the <a href="https://www.movewecarry.lu">MoveWeCarry</a>, the free service which transports your luggage from accommodation to accommodation while we only carried our day hiking gear!</p>

<h2 id="day-2-larochette---beaufort---mullerthal">Day 2: Larochette - Beaufort - Mullerthal</h2>

<p>After a plentiful breakfast at the Youth Hostel we drop off the <a href="https://tidd.ly/3djoxgt">‚àû luggage</a> again for MoveWeCarry and‚Ä¶ decide to skip the next section to Beaufort. It‚Äôs raining so much, and with the morning section of the trail going over the highest part of the complete Mullerthal Trail, over fields without any protection from the forest, we simply take the free Bus to Beaufort.</p>

<p>When we arrive in Beaufort it still is raining so we continue to walk to the <a href="https://beaufortcastles.com">Beaufort castle</a> - or actually castles, as there‚Äôs two next to each other. We buy a ticket for the guided tour which starts at 11:00 o‚Äôclock and explore in the meantime the old castle with its towers and dungeons!</p>

<p>It also was a good thing that we were wearing our <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=94dd5ba4-d929-42a1-a554-858677c0c475&amp;website_id=a037a589-aec6-4e81-920c-77b10ab91eff&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhoudinisportswear.com%2Fen-us%2Fclothing%2Fjackets%2Fms-d-jacket-248184%3Fcolor%3D248184081">‚àû waterproofs</a>, as it continued to rain, and rain, and rain üåß I tried to hide away from the rain in the torture chamber and prison, but they‚Äôre not really very cozy places to hang out üòÜ</p>

<p>And then our Guided Tour started, and we went across a small bridge into the Renaissance Castle. We stood with our small group in the rain, listening to the Guide telling the Stories in Dutch and German, and then also got to go inside!</p>

<p>It is a very beautiful castle and I understand why my good friend <a href="https://kathrindeter.com">Kathrin from Helsinki</a> likes these castles so much. My favourite part was the garden, though - and we got to see it briefly in the pouring rain‚Ä¶</p>

<p>There was a lot of interesting things to see and the guided tour went quick - but at the end of it it stopped to rain! We ate the rest of our picnic lunch in the castle, tried the famous Cassero blackcurrant liqueur which is still today produced in the castle and then bade farewell to it, ready for hiking. As the Mullerthal Trail goes past the Beaufort Castle we didn‚Äôt have to go far till we reached the trail either, and soon we were again in the pretty surroundings of beech trees and rock formations!</p>

<p>I did not expect anything of this section of the trail, but was very positively surprised: It was gorgeous. The trail runs next to the small ‚ÄúHaupeschbaach‚Äù which offers lots of small waterfalls along the way, which meant: More long exposures! I carried the <a href="https://youtu.be/QC_Ox0pgK84">Sony a6600 camera</a>, which Sony loaned me, on this section and it did really well with the long exposures, even if I didn‚Äôt have any Filters for it!</p>

<p>Now while I was very pleased about the possibility to take long exposures of the waterfalls, Martin was less enthusiastic about the constant breaks.</p>

<p>It was also busy on this section of the trail - a group of US Americans passed us, as well as some Dutch Hikers and a photographer who was here for the same reason as me. But this only seemed ‚Äúbusy‚Äù as we hadn‚Äôt seen other hikers on the other days, or as many. I guess on a sunny weekend it will be a lot more busy than on this rainy &amp; wet October afternoon!</p>

<p>After a while we entered the Hallerbachtal, a narrow valley with the small stream running through it, and many wooden bridges making you cross from side to side. It‚Äôs a beautiful valley with impressive rock formations, but before long we left the forested valley and came out into an open, wide valley where we were greeted by black cows.</p>

<p>We passed the Mansion from <a href="https://amzn.to/3mVxHTt">‚àû Resident Evil</a> on the way and were wondering what the kind people of the Umbrella Cooperation were doing up there, and were happy to put some kilometres between the centre of the Zombie outbreak and us. As the trails here down in the valley were great and it started to rain üåß again it didn‚Äôt take us long and to leave that Mansion on the hill behind us. Hiking along the fields and under the yellow leafs üçÇ, with a light mist hanging in the air, it was beautiful. And so we were soon back at the Heringer Millen in Mullerthal and finished the <a href="https://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en/fiche/walking/stage-trail-mullerthal-trail-route-3">Route 3 of the Mullerthal Trail</a>.</p>

<h2 id="practicalities---where-to-stay-what-to-eat-and-how-to-get-around">Practicalities - Where to Stay, What to Eat and How to get Around</h2>

<p>We stayed at the <a href="https://lecigalon.lu">H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon</a> in Mullerthal for one night, where we also ate. It was a good room and tasty food, though the portions were possibly a bit small for hungry hikers =)</p>

<p>In Larochette we slept in an apartment at the <a href="https://youthhostels.lu/en/youth-hostels/youth-hostel-larochette">Larochette Youth Hostel</a> where we also ate. The food was really good, as was the service, and our small apartment was actually pretty large and a group of six could easily sleep in there.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, we only carried our hiking gear and our luggage was transported for free by <a href="https://www.movewecarry.lu">MoveWeCarry</a> - a service which is available to all hikers on the Mullerthal Trail, and an excellent service for those that do not want to carry everything from accommodation to accommodation.</p>

<p>At the Tourist Information Heringer Millen in Mullerthal you can buy a <a href="https://www.mullerthal-millen.lu/en/touristcenter/picnic">picnic basket with tasty local &amp; regional food</a>. If you still need some hiking boots, a day pack or umbrella - that you also can loan at the <a href="https://www.mullerthal-millen.lu/en/touristcenter/bow">Best of Wandern</a> station - for free! SO it‚Äôs definitely a good spot to start your hike, and also if you need more Infos.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/en/timetables-and-lines/bus/">Public bus transportation in Luxembourg</a> is free. Jump on a bus to get from one corner of the country to the other one (it‚Äôs a small country, so easy to do). The busses are plentiful and seem to stop even in the smallest villages, so hiking the Mullerthal Trail - or skipping a section in the rain - is easy to do.</p>

<p>After we hiked the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/11/mullerthal-trail-route-1.html">Mullerthal Trail Route 1</a> in completely terrible weather, on the morning of our third day the sun is shining, some clouds are slowly moving across the blue sky and it is a nice, warm 15¬∞C outside. It‚Äôs exactly the kind of weather you want when you hike <a href="https://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en/fiche/walking/stage-trail-mullerthal-trail-route-2">Route 2 of the Mullerthal Trail</a>. This is THE Route of the Mullerthal trail, with one scenic spot after the other. Which means, if you‚Äôre a photographer like me, the going will be slow üòÜ</p>

<p>We left Echternach on foot and soon passed the Trooskn√§ppchen view point, where we took a look back on the town which was out home the past three nights. Our luggage will be awaiting us at our next home for the night, so we can hike with light packs on the trail.</p>

<p>The trail goes along the left side of the valley, on the other side of it and the river is Germany, literally a stone throw away. The trail gives nice views on this valley, and the interaction of sunshine and clouds is pretty to observe. It does not take long and we are at the first scenic viewpoint of Route 2, the Wolfsschlucht, a steep canyon in which in past times wolves were hiding. It‚Äôs an impressive sight and we enjoy it a lot, but are surprised that after you have climbed the hundreds of stairs there‚Äôs a small cauldron from which stairs go further up on both sides. We climb both sets of stairs and are rewarded by beautiful views on the valley, with sunshine on our faces ‚òÄÔ∏è</p>

<p>The trail goes on past moss-covered rocks and green beech trees, stairs down, over little bridges, impressive rock walls. A pair of Dutch hikers pass us and ask if we know where the ‚ÄúLabyrinth‚Äù is - which is the next highlight, and which was just a few hundred meters ahead of us =)</p>

<p>The Labyrinth is described as <em>‚Äúa maze of rocks‚Äù</em> but the truth is that i‚Äôs less a maze than just a bunch of rocks where the trail goes through. It‚Äôs pretty, nevertheless. For these 3 km we already needed more than an hour, because of all the photo and video breaks. We arrive at the Perekop viewpoint, and decide to not go climb it - but I briefly let the drone go up and snap some photos from up in the air. The trail now leads away from the road and deeper into a forest canyon, where we go over half a dozen bridges which go over a small stream.</p>

<p>We climb some stairs and then stand in front of the mouth of the Huel Lee cave. This is a really popular spot but the moment we arrive the only other being there with us is a small stray cat, which miaus at us. Huel Lee is a cave where the local mill stones were ‚Äúbroken‚Äù from the rock, which generated this large cave. It‚Äôs a beautiful sight, and later on we learn that this is the only place where the rock quality was right for mill stones. I take a lot of photos while Martin talks to the cat, and as we leave we try to guide it with us back to Berdorf, but the wee cat decides to stay at the cave. We hope it will be well, and walk on.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs three hours after we have left Echternach that we arrive in Berdorf, which amounts to around 2 km of speed per hour. Yeps, that is REALLY slow.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50837160748/in/photostream/" title="Towards Berdorf"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50837160748_9a63541012_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Towards Berdorf" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In Berdorf we head into the <a href="https://en.trailinn.lu">Trail-Inn</a> Caf√© &amp; Restaurant. We order some coffee and some absolutely fantastic cake, but as I order the bill we‚Äôre a bit shocked to pay 20‚Ç¨ for two coffees and pieces of üç∞! As we leave Berdorf Martin and me are very much looking forward to the next section to the M√ºllerthal, there‚Äôs a lot of scenic spots along this section of the trail. Sadly we soon find the trail closed and a Detour sign - a flood destroyed the bridges here, and currently the final bridges and paths are put into place.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50837892771/in/photostream/" title="Um Leit Ung"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50837892771_ddafb377f6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Um Leit Ung" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This detour at least speeds us up considerably, and it‚Äôs also really pretty. We‚Äôre high above the normal trail and can get (careful) glimpses of the scenery down in the valley where Route 2 would take us along - we guess we‚Äôre between 30 and 50 m high up, so standing at the lip of rocks is scary. Not long and we‚Äôre at the Binzeltschl√´ff rock formation, which throwns above a road which is very silent. I fly my Drone again, and then we cross the road and Martin and me climb and squeeze through the Priedegtstull rocks. We laugh a lot here, it‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt usually get to do and if our kids would be here, they‚Äôd love it as much as we, we realize!</p>

<p>As we arrive at the top we realize that we definitely took the most adventurous detour through the rocks, as there also would have been a very easy path up here. But probably it was a lot less fun than our route! We take a look over the land from the viewpoint, and then dive into the forest.</p>

<h2 id="day-2-consdorf-mllerthal---scheidgen---echternach">Day 2 Consdorf/ M√ºllerthal - Scheidgen - Echternach</h2>

<p>This was a long, sunny and enjoyable day of being outdoors in nature. After a good breakfast we hiked up to the Schiessent√ºmpel, the largest waterfall in Luxembourg and most photographed spot on the Mullerthal trail. We were lucky that there wasn‚Äôt a lot of people around this early in the morning, so after many photos and a drone flight (watch the Video!) we continued.</p>

<p>The trail leads up into the forest and we pass impressive rock formations like the Eulenburg, the Goldfralay with its little canyon and where a path leads up to the top of the cliff. It‚Äôs beautiful and we enjoy the scenery, hiking along these high rock walls.</p>

<p>We cross the street not far from the Consdorfer Millen, another mill, and are on a wide forest road while the sun climbs higher and sends its rays through the beech trees.</p>

<p>Then a narrow single trail path leads up into the forest, and not long and we are at the highlights of this section: Three very narrow canyons/ caves, two which also require a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/petzl-bindi-head-torch/?pid=10239">headlamp</a> to get through as they are completely dark. First is the Rittergang, a narrow canyon through which Martin and I squeeze, laughing about this kind of experience.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50468590723/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Squeeze in, Rittergang"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50468590723_f63c2abcbd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Squeeze in, Rittergang" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Next is the Deiwepetz canyon, which feels really long and the trail snakes through this even narrower canyon. It also gets pretty dark once you‚Äôre a few steps away from the entry, and I‚Äôm happy I have my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/petzl-iko-core-head-torch/?pid=10239">Petzl IKO Core</a> along.</p>

<p>We exit the Diewepetz, smiling. The sun shines, it gets warm, and we have one more canyon/ cave in front of us, the best one if we can believe our guide book! To get to the Kuelscheier cave you can hike the marked Circuit Trail, which also takes you up to a viewing point, or you can stay on the trail and get to the entry of the cave. We chose to do the circuit, and then head into the cave. It takes a turn and you‚Äôre in immediate darkness, and without some light you‚Äôre quickly falling or hurting yourself, as it is narrow, there are corners, stairs and narrow passages.</p>

<p>We exit the cave and continue on Route 2 now towards Hersberg, though shortly before the village we take a shortcut and head onwards to Scheidgen.</p>

<p>The warm weather and sunshine are very pleasant, we enjoy every moment out here in nature, being on this wonderful trail. And it does not get boring: It takes us along prehistoric grinding grooves and then leads up out of the forest and we cross some fields, before we are back in the forest. We cross small wooden bridges which allow us to keep the feet dry and take a look at the small M√©chelskierch cave which was home to a hermit in the 18. century.</p>

<p>In Scheidgen we hope into the <a href="https://lebonrepos.lu/restaurant/">Hotel Bon Repos &amp; Restaurant Le Grill</a> for lunch. Martin has a very tasty looking Hamburger while I eat a delicious salad, and we enjoy the view into the kitchen were the Chefs are preparing our food. Route 2 continues now for another 8 km till Echternach, and we hike down into a narrow, wooded valley.</p>

<p>We are passed by three Trailrunners, and now encounter also some more hikers, but not really a lot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the trail is showing itself from its most beautiful side. Light beech forests bath the trail in a warm, green-golden light, while the red-grey-green rock faces surprise us with different forms and make us smile.</p>

<p>After a few hours we arrive above Echternach and enjoy the view on the Abbey from up here in the forest. It‚Äôs funny how different it feels to come back here in warm weather and sunshine, and not soaking wet in the rain! We take a shortcut to the Campground, where we will be sleeping in a <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/sleeping-like-diogenes">Wooden Barrel</a>. We take a really nice warm shower and switch into some <a href="https://tidd.ly/3oCbf13">‚àû clean</a> and <a href="https://tidd.ly/2LeBvAU">‚àû fresh</a> <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/01/DUER-All-Weather-Denim-Jeans.html">clothes</a>, and head again to the Restaurant Aal Eechternoach for our celebratory Dinner!</p>

<h2 id="practicalities---where-to-stay-what-to-eat-and-how-to-get-around">Practicalities - Where to Stay, What to Eat and How to get Around</h2>

<p>We stayed at the start and the end of our trip in Echternach, which is a small town - the oldest in Luxembourg - which we really liked. We stayed the first three nights in the <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/tower-hamelmaous">medieval fortification tower H√§melmaous</a> which really was a beautiful experience. There‚Äôs a cozy kitchen at the ground floor, and then there‚Äôs four more floors in this round tower. It easily should sleep a family of four or more, and it‚Äôs also really close to the centre and the bus stop. At the end of our trip we slept in a <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/sleeping-like-diogenes">Wooden Barrel</a> on the Campground, which was a really cozy experience as well. I slept like a stone in my barrel, which is good for one to two persons and possibly a small child or two. The camping place is a wee bit outta town - some five to ten minutes of walking to the centre, but really close to the trail.</p>

<p>While hiking Route 2 you can stay either at ‚Äú<a href="https://www.visitconsdorf.lu/en/camping-la-pinede/camping-la-pinede-2">La Pin√®de Camping</a>‚Äù in Consdorf or at the <a href="https://lecigalon.lu">H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon</a> in Mullerthal, both are along Route 2 and pretty much in the middle of this trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50897605248/in/dateposted/" title="H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50897605248_ebd18e5549_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="H√¥tel-Restaurant Le Cigalon" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Both have options for eating out - at the Camping place in Consdorf we ate at the <a href="https://www.brass.lu">Brasserie op Buergkapp</a> which was tasty and plenty, while at the 4‚≠êÔ∏è Le Cigalon the food was good but it took ages and portions are small - so if you‚Äôre hungry after a long day of hiking, pick wisely!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/en/timetables-and-lines/bus/">Public bus transportation in Luxembourg</a> is free. Jump on a bus to get from one corner of the country to the other one (it‚Äôs a small country, so easy to do). The busses are plentiful and seem to stop even in the smallest villages, so hiking the Mullerthal Trail (or any other trail for that matter) in sections is easy to do.</p>

<h2 id="day-1-echternach---rosport---moersdorf">Day 1: Echternach - Rosport - Moersdorf</h2>

<p>Monday morning 7:00 o‚Äôclock, rain is hitting the windows of our <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/tower-hamelmaous">medieval fortification tower</a> in which were are sleeping while staying in Echternach, Luxembourg. Martin and me get up, happy about all this dry space and the warmth inside - we have experienced these kinds of mornings very differently over the past ten years, and while we were sceptical about <em>‚Äúnot sleeping in a tent‚Äù</em> we really didn‚Äôt mind not having to pack up a wet shelter and gear this morning. Instead we sat in our warm &amp; dry kitchen, ate breakfast and then set off hiking <a href="https://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en/fiche/walking/stage-trail-mullerthal-trail-route-1">Route 1 of the Mullerthal Trail</a>. While bells of the church ring we start the hike from the centre of Echternach, the oldest town in Luxembourg.</p>

<p>We walk through the pretty Park just behind the Abbey and then along the river S√ªre, which is also the Border to Germany on the other side. The light drizzle isn‚Äôt a problem, and after around 2 km we leave the river behind and climb up into the forest. Here the real Mullerthal Trail starts. Right away we see impressive rock formations tower above our right while we hike towards Rosport, the first village along the trail today. But till there it are still many kilometres, and the drizzle is becoming a more steady rain. It‚Äôs time for me to don my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/08/200-g-hardshell-montane-podium-pull-on-and-pants.html">Montane Podium Pull-on &amp; Pants</a>, a procedure which will be done several times per day on this hike, depending on the intensity of the rain.</p>

<p>Everything is wet. And green. A vibrant, wet green üå≥ Except the rocks - these tower in various shades of grey and brown along the trail, though truth be told - many are also covered in green moss. Once in a while traffic noise comes through the trees from the street far beneath us, but there‚Äôs other sounds closer by: The dripping of the rain on the beech leafs. Bird song accompanies us while we wander through the green jungle. Small streams gurgle through their beds when they run over rocks. And that soft, wet sound when you walk through mud with your <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/03/la-sportiva-crossover-2-dot-0-gtx.html">shoes</a>.</p>

<p>Never far away is also one of the Mullerthal Trailblazes, a red M on a white background. Overall signs really aren‚Äôt an issue on the trail - it‚Äôs a Premium Trail after all, which means there‚Äôs supposed to be a Trailblaze every 250 m. Also other signs are in no short abundance to be seen, from Signposts which tell you how far it is to the next place to trail markers for the dozens of other local trails which criss-cross the Mullerthal Trail. Sometimes we encountered signposts which had markings for seven different trails on them, from MTB Trails over border-crossing trails to local loop trails - there‚Äôs no shortage of outdoor possibilities in this corner of Luxembourg, be it hiking, trailrunning or Mountain Biking.</p>

<p>We continue in a good mood on this pretty trail, and even when it really starts to pour down we smile about the beauty which surrounds us. Mighty, green beech trees üå≥üå≥üå≥ keep most of the rain at bay and act like a giant umbrella. A soft brown blanket of old leafs makes for comfortable hiking. And small details make me smile.</p>

<p>We reach Rosport after a couple of hours and take a peak into the village if we spot an open Caf√©, but no, there‚Äôs nothing to be seen. A large truck picks up milk from a local farmer as we hike out of Rosport, and we hope to get a short, dry moment in the Tudor Museum, but also it is closed. Ah well, happily I have some <a href="http://trailbutter.eu/">Trail Butter</a> with me, which I eat on the go.</p>

<p>We leave the forest behind for a moment and right at that time the wind starts to accelerate and hit us with its might - and the rain. We pass the Pilgrimage Chapel at Girsterklaus, and shortly ponder if we should try our luck and see if it is open, or simply continue. The rain and wind make the decision to search for some shelter easy, and much to our surprise and luck the Chapel is open - as is the toilet building in front of it! We wash our hands and disinfect them and look for the door to gain entry to the small Chapel.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50468552333/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Girsterklaus Chapel"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50468552333_f2dd7dc8c9_6k.jpg" width="6000" height="4000" alt="Girsterklaus Chapel" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Again we are in luck and find the Chapel open, and unoccupied. Better even, there‚Äôs a heating system blowing warm, dry air into the chapel, and we immediately sit down in front of it. We hang up rain jackets to dry a bit, snack some nuts, drink water. I wander around the Chapel, admiring the beautiful wooden carvings - some which are almost 500 years old.</p>

<p>As we set off a while later, the rain has stopped, and we also get back into the forest. A younger forest.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469409907/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Beech Forest, moist"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469409907_bfc8c0e979_6k.jpg" width="6000" height="4000" alt="Beech Forest, moist" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A forest next to open fields. In one of these we see a young deer, who is mighty unimpressed by us sneaking up on him to snap a photo.</p>

<p>Close to Moersdorf we pick some absolutely amazing tasty apples, plums and pears from the trees next to the trail. These <em>‚ÄúStreuobstwiesen‚Äù</em>, or mixed orchard meadows, are often to be found along the trail, and in this Region of Luxembourg they use the fruits to make juice, cider and tasty food from them. And for us wet and hungry hikers, they are a very welcome snack!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs around 15:15 when we reach the signpost which says it‚Äôs 700 m to Moersdorf, the village where we planned to stop. <em>But it‚Äôs so early</em> we talk with Martin, <em>should we still continue to Mompach or Herborn? Then we have less to hike tomorrow.</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469620127/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Almost in Echternach!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469620127_34f4528c3e_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Almost in Echternach!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the end we decide to stick to the original plan, and hike down to Moersdorf. We locate the Busstop right away and don‚Äôt even have to wait long, before the Bus back to Echternach arrives. Public Transportation in Luxembourg is free, for everyone. As someone who does not own a car and who uses public transportation (or my bike!) all the time to get around, this is something I obviously absolutely LOVE. Free, punctual public transportation, across the whole country. Fantastic! It‚Äôs a 20 minute ride back to Echternach, and then we walk back to our medieval fortification tower for a warm shower and dry clothes. Obviously it also stopped to rain now‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="day-2-moersdorf---herborn---echternach">Day 2: Moersdorf - Herborn - Echternach</h2>

<p>Which is not something one could say of the next morning. The rain hammers against the windows of our tower, and after the breakfast we walk to the bus station to return to Moersdorf and continue our hike. Despite us both wearing our waterproofs we don‚Äôt look happy or in a high mood. But it doesn‚Äôt take long and we stand at the bus stop in Moersdorf, so all we can do is continue to hike back to the trail up in the forest. Which we do. And the forest doesn‚Äôt last long. In fact, a look on the map says we‚Äôll be hiking out in the open for a considerable amount of time today. On a sunny, clear day one is supposed to have great views across the land from up here, but all we see are fields, windmills and the rain which is blowing into our faces.</p>

<p>Until the village of Mompach we pretty much are exposed to the wind and rain, so when we enter the forest after Mompach, and then see two Pavilions, we are very grateful for the possibility to get out of the elements for a moment. Martin brews us a coffee on his <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/primus-lite-gas-stove/?pid=10238">‚àû Primus Lite+</a>, and after some more nuts, chocolate and a hot coffee we are in a better mood. Also, it seems we now will be hiking for a while in the forest, and not out in the open between fields.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not a very photogenic weather, so we are fast. Less than an half an hour later we are seeing Herborn already, the next village which we will pass through.</p>

<p>Again there is no Caf√© in sight, so we simply pass through the village in the rain. Happily, just before the forest, there is another open hut with a bench, where we have another short break out of the rain. It is now so wet that I decide to put my camera into my backpack and use my new <a href="https://amzn.to/35fK8B2">‚àû GoPro HERO 9</a> to take photos and videos instead. It‚Äôs not something I would usually do, as I see my equipment as a tool that needs to survive these harsh conditions, but I also didn‚Äôt want to risk it to get even more soaked on the 2nd day of the trip.</p>

<p>Happily at some point the rain decided to make a short break, and we also were again in a forest. A pretty, vibrant green beech forest.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469275651/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="M"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469275651_e780818e5d_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="M" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>These last few kilometres of Route 1 were again enjoyable. We were in a good mood, here, in this üå≥ green forest. We made jokes. Laughed. Had another break, in another hut.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469438292/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Bench and Hut and Bin"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469438292_62bee33dc0_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Bench and Hut and Bin" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then we saw Echternach.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469281436/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Echternach"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469281436_268218a6af_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Echternach" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The forest road became a pretty path.</p>

<p>Slippery, yes. But better than an asphalt road between open fields.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50469442542/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Jakobsweg"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50469442542_5531927d04_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Jakobsweg" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then we were back in Echternach, at the lake. Together with the rain.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50468586188/in/album-72157716398467206/" title="Swan"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50468586188_a73ba9cfb9_4k.jpg" width="4096" height="2731" alt="Swan" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Our conclusion of Route 1</strong> is that the first section from Echternach to Moersdorf via Rosport is a beautiful section (according to my Suunto Spartan Ultra GPS it were 20 km) through beautiful forests and along intriguing rock formations. The Chapel in Girsterklaus is pretty and does make for a good break spot, the apple, pear and plum trees which occasionally are next to the trail are in the autumn full of tasty fruits, and there‚Äôs some really scenic trail section.</p>

<p><em>Now for the section from Moersdorf to Herborn and back to Echternach‚Ä¶</em> I would not hike it if you‚Äôre not a completionist who is hunting for the title of <em>‚ÄúI hiked the complete Mullerthal Trail‚Äù</em>. Maybe in sunny and warm weather the asphalt &amp; forest roads next to fields are enjoyable, but in the rain they were not. Martin and I both agreed that it would have made more sense to completely skip the 2nd part of Route 1 and hike on Route 2, which is the absolute highlight route of the Mullerthal Route with an amazing scenery spot every kilometre.</p>

<p>We were lucky that there were huts on the second day in which we could get a small break from the rain and wind, but this section was such a stark contrast to the beautiful forest part on Day 1 that we felt a bit let down. But then we had another four amazing hiking days on the Mullerthal Trail, so don‚Äôt worry üòÅ! Trip Reports from Route 2 and 3 will follow in short order.</p>

<h2 id="practicalities---where-to-stay-what-to-eat-and-how-to-get-around">Practicalities - Where to Stay, What to Eat and How to get Around</h2>

<p>We stayed at the start and the end of our trip in Echternach, which is a small town - the oldest in Luxembourg - which we really liked. We stayed the first three nights in the <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/tower-hamelmaous">medieval fortification tower H√§melmaous</a> which really was a beautiful experience. There‚Äôs a cozy kitchen at the ground floor, and then there‚Äôs four more floors in this round tower. It easily should sleep a family of four or more, and it‚Äôs also really close to the centre and the bus stop. At the end of our trip we slept in a <a href="https://www.visitechternach.lu/en/camping/sleeping-like-diogenes">Wooden Barrel</a> on the Campground, which was a really cozy experience as well. I slept like a stone in my barrel, which is good for one to two persons and possibly a small child or two. The camping place is a wee bit outta town - some five to ten minutes of walking to the centre, but really close to the trail.</p>

<p>We ate every evening in the <a href="https://aaleechternoach.lu/">Restaurant Aal Eechternoach</a>, which we picked because of the positive reviews it had on Google Maps - and as we went there every evening you probably understand that they also have good food =) They use a lot of local ingredients and also serve local beverages - the local apple juice was delicious, as were all their Vegan offerings. Martin ate the best Cordon Bleu of his life here, and it did look really very good indeed. There‚Äôs a small supermarket not far from the tower, and a few smaller ones on the main shopping street, where there‚Äôs also a nice wee bakery which had good baked goods.</p>

<p>As I wrote above: <a href="https://www.mobiliteit.lu/en/timetables-and-lines/bus/">Public bus transportation in Luxembourg</a> is free. Jump on a bus to get from one corner of the country to the other one (it‚Äôs a small country, so easy to do). The busses are plentiful and seem to stop even in the smallest villages, so hiking the Mullerthal Trail (or any other trail for that matter) in sections is easy to do.</p>
