    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Wildside: The Enchanted Life of Hunters and Gatherers</em> is another book by <a href="http://shop.gestalten.com/books/wildside.html">Gestalten</a> that caters to the lifestyle outdoor Instagram person. At least that was my first impression when I saw the book - but covers can lie, and once I started to read I actually quite liked it.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35703340791/in/photostream/" title="Wildside: The Enchanted Life of Hunters and Gatherers"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4235/35703340791_3a545d6ede_b.jpg" width="970" height="1024" alt="Wildside: The Enchanted Life of Hunters and Gatherers" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Gestalten Publishing house has published a host of books - <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/07/the-great-wide-open.html">The Great Wide Open</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/04/off-the-road.html">Off the Road</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/hide-and-seek.html">Hide and Seek - The Architecture of Cabins and Hide-Outs</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/04/the-outsiders.html">The Outsiders</a>  - which all look a bit like they garner to the Instagram crowd - and probably that’s what they want and do. And while some of these are not really a success for me, others are good. <a href="http://amzn.to/2tLQ9EM">Wildside</a> is in the latter camp, even if the Cover can be deceiving and you might just think this book is like Instagram photos you’ve seen a thousand times just printed on nice paper, but it has more to offer on its 250 something pages.</p>

<p>There’s essays of #Vanlife Dwellers in the book, inspiring and artsy photos, little businesses are showcased, you learn more about hunting in Germany and Sweden, you go foraging in Finland and then you are taken surfing and to Switzerland. It’s a visual journey interspersed with short stories and essays, and even if some of these topics might not interest you much you might find a little piece of joy or wisdom from another one, so take the time to read each - because if not you might miss out.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35703340211/in/photostream/" title="Wildside: The Enchanted Life of Hunters and Gatherers Book"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4255/35703340211_24b639e221_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Wildside: The Enchanted Life of Hunters and Gatherers Book" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So whom is this book aimed at? If you feel like you’d like to see what else is possible than running the rat race from 9-to-5 every day, then this book certainly can plant some ideas into your mind. Or if you’re looking for inspiration where to travel next. Or even how to travel - by #Vanlife, on foot or in a canoe, there’s better options than flying for a week to an all-inclusive resort (<em>but that you, as a reader of an outdoor blog, knew either way already</em> ;).</p>

<p>Also for those who look for culinary ideas this book obviously will be of interest, be it from gathering mushrooms or catching fish - modern Hunters &amp; Gatherers will enjoy this book without a doubt. Overall it is a beautiful book that inspires to try something new, presented in a visually pleasing way, though I do find the chosen typefaces for much of the text unsuccessful as it isn’t pleasing to read. Other than that - if you’re interested in one thing I told about of this book - check out a copy at your local library or order a copy home to sit down with it, out in the summer sun.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/05/wild-atlantic-way.html">Ireland</a> to Britain: Bikepacking on the Wild Trails of Britain takes you &amp; your bike on the most beautiful multi-day rides in Wales, Scotland and England.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27183101282/in/dateposted/" title="Bikepacking"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7252/27183101282_48e647f3ba_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bikepacking" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Bikepacking is a big trend these days (check the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/02/bikepacking-bag-manufacturers.html">The Bikepacking Framebag Manufacturer List</a> to see how to transform your bike into a bikepacking rig) so it was a nice surprise as I was contacted by Wild Things Publishing and a question if they could use one of my photos in the book. Sure they could! As a wee thank you they sent me a copy of the book, and as I love alternative travel guide books <em>Bikepacking on the Wild Trails of Britain</em> was right up my alley.</p>

<p>It is another beautiful book that will inspire you to pack up your bike and head to Britain in order to ride one (<em>or more!</em>) of the presented trips. From Epic Wilderness Rides over Family Rides to Technical &amp; Coastal Trails, the book presents 30 trips which range from a night to a week or riding in the countryside of Britain. The book starts off with an introduction to bikepacking and some history, some stories to get you in the mood, tips on gear - including a cool short chapter on tarps! - and how to plan a ride. In short: All you need to get on your bike and head out for a night or more in the wild. After the introduction it takes you on the different rides, which make up the majority of the book. These are sorted by regions in the UK - from the South East to the South West of England to the Midlands, Scotland and Wales. A map of the UK in the beginning highlights where these trips are to be found (good for planning) and a table on the next page gives  quick overview of relevant data about the rides - including distance, ascent and how many percent of the ride are off-road.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27183101142/in/dateposted/" title="Bikepacking"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7326/27183101142_3113691725_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bikepacking" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I loved the very well designed info boxes which had all needed information ready with one look, a small map which gave a good idea of the ride (though you’ll need a real map for your adventure) and the beautiful photos. The trip descriptions are entertaining little trip reports in their own which will make you anticipate your own ride even more. All in all a unique book that is beautifully designed &amp; presented. If you’re into bikepacking and want to go to Britain for a wee adventure or more, this book is a recommended read!</p>

<p>Last year I was lucky enough to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/sea-stack-climbing-in-ireland.html">explore Ireland</a>, hike the IAT and go sea stack climbing. What caught my interest and brought me to the Green Isle, however, was the Wild Atlantic Way: The world’s longest coastal touring route which goes from south to north along the west coast and is over 2.500 km long. There’s all kind of adventures to be had along the WAW, from visits in picturesque Irish villages and their pubs to bigger towns and their cultural offerings. However, <a href="http://threerockbooks.com/index.php/exploring-irelands-wild-atlantic-way/">Exploring Ireland’s Wild Atlantic Way</a> helps you find the off-the-beaten-track gems and takes you outdoors into the fresh, Irish air (and occasional rain shower!).</p>

<p>On 224 pages <em>Exploring Ireland’s Wild Atlantic Way</em> takes you from the south in Kinsale to the far north of Malin Head along the coast. In seven chapters - divided by county - you can start to explore the Wild Atlantic Way. Do you fancy surfing, sea stack climbing and lots of remote wilderness? Then head to Donegal in the north. Do you prefer a cable car ride to an island, trying your luck fishing or going cycling? Then Cork in the south is a good place to start your adventures! Wherever you decide to go, <em>Exploring Ireland’s Wild Atlantic Way</em> will have an insider tip ready for you. The seven county chapters are further divided into sections, each coming with their own little overview map to give you a feel of the land. Hundreds of gorgeous photos will get you in the mood to explore, while the detailed introduction chapter gives tips on when to come, what to bring and any other question you may have.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Big walls, inspiring stories, epic climbing photos - that’s <a href="http://bit.ly/1RvKL98">Yosemite in the Fifties</a> in a nutshell.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27183101812/in/dateposted/" title="Yosemite in the Fifties Cover"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7095/27183101812_79dc07e245_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Yosemite in the Fifties Cover" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>“Show me a climber who doesn’t know Yosemite and I show you someone who doesn’t climb.”</em> OK, I made that up, but there’s a hint of truth in that: Climbers from across the globe know the view down the valley on El Cap, heard about the epic Dawn Wall climb of Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson in 2015, and just long to stand underneath the towering granite walls of El Capitain before also they will start to scale it. Yosemite in the Fifties transportes you back in time to the iron age of climbing history in the valley, when climbers where pushing the envelope of what had been thought possible and established the routes we still climb today.</p>

<p>The book is a collection of beautiful photos of the valley, the protagonists and their climbs, all taken with cameras that relied on the skill &amp; knowledge of the operator. In between these inspiring photos are four chapters with over a dozen essays. These essays are from original source material - first-person narratives and anecdotes of the climbers and their friends, interspersed with archive photos and shots of memorabilia from back in the day. Stories range from a history of climbing tools over portraits to historic climbing routes. With over 200 pages and twenty essays <em>Yosemite in the Fifties</em> is captivating for a long time and a book one can go back to time &amp; again to let the imagination wander off once more while looking at the old photos or reading one of the adventurous stories.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27183102042/in/dateposted/" title="Yosemite in the Fifties Inside"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7301/27183102042_88924e20aa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Yosemite in the Fifties Inside" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Climbing in Yosemite is high on my bucket list so <em>Yosemite in the Fifties</em> is a book I enjoyed immensely. It’s a tasteful combination of visuals and stories, many written by John Long, one of climbing’s best writers. If climbing in Yosemite is something you also aspire to, I think you should pick up this beautiful coffee table book and immerse yourself into the history of the Iron Age of climbing in the valley. The stories and little anecdotes will surely be something that will make your wish to go to Yosemite even stronger, and once you’re standing on a ledge on El Cap Tower you will remember this book, it stories, and smile - because now you are there, and become part of its history!</p>

<p>I met <a href="http://www.christine-on-big-trip.blogspot.fi">Christine</a> two years ago as she was cycling through Finland, and we spent a nice afternoon eating cake and sushi in Vaasa. Of course I knew her much longer digitally, but it was really nice to finally met her and hear more about her stories from hiking, paddling and cycling around the globe. If you’re not so lucky to meet German Tourist (her Trailname) then you should pick up a copy of her book <em>Laufen. Essen. Schlafen.</em> which was published just a month ago. It’s in German, though, so I hope your Deutsch skills are up to scratch. The book chronicles GT’s decision from first hiking one long-distance trail in the US to all three and abandoning a <em>normal</em> 9-to-5 life.</p>

<p>The book starts out with Christine as a successful business women who is on holiday in the US, to losing her job and a good friend which in turn make her decide to go hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. The hiking story reminded me in parts of Keith’s <a href="http://amzn.to/1XbLlQl">The Last Englishman</a>, a book about Keith’s PCT hike. It’s a mix of trail description, <em>trail talk</em> (gossip) and Chrisitine’s experiences on the PCT. The PCT chapter is also the longest of the 288 page long book, with each subsequent chapter getting shorter.</p>

<p>The CDT chapter then starts again with Christine the successful business woman, a romance that’s doomed from the start, and the hard hiking life on the CDT. No rest days for three and a half months! During the CDT chapter German Tourist meets friends from the PCT again, loses her job while hiking the CDT and subsequently decides to quite the 9-to-5 rat race life. The AT chapter, which is a mere fifty something pages, then feels hurried. There’s the misery at the start, the realization that she does not need to hurry anymore, more meetings with old friends from the PCT and pretty autumn hiking through the green jungle.</p>

<p>I read the book in a day and overall found it an enjoyable read. There were a few sections that made me thoughtful, sad, laugh and anticipate what would happen next. The book is entertaining, but I felt that in the CDT and AT chapter Christine was just in a hurry to finish the book and get outdoors again - I would have wished for similar insights &amp; details from her about these two trails, too. Despite this I think it is a great read for anyone who is interested in hiking and long-distance backpacking, as Christine writes eloquently about the life on the trail and what it entails. The sections about her conversations with fellow thru-hikers and trail angels where my favourites by far, and made me want to pack my backpack and fly over to the USA! Get your copy from <a href="https://www.piper.de/buecher/laufen-essen-schlafen-isbn-978-3-89029-471-1">Piper</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1rwC7BW">Amazon.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1rwCgp9">Amazon.de</a>.</p>
