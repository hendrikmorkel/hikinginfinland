<p>We had 7 Shops participating in our One Stop Shop Series this year, and I created an eight Multi-Stop-Shop List for the kicks of it. Before I delve in more, here’s the lists with prices and weights side by side:</p>

</table>

<p><br />What is interesting to see is that in comparison to 2014 that the lists got a lot lighter. Where in 2014 the average list was 5.667 g heavy nowadays the average is almost 900 g lighter, at 4.868 g. However, the price per gram went up and also the average price per list went up by around 250€ - which, if we want to account for Inflation and such, probably is not as bad as it might sound.</p>

<p>With the exceptions of Alpinetrek andWalk On The Wild Side which are more Allround Outdoor Shops (though as we can see, who both have everything an aspiring UL Backpacker needs) we also have five shops which are selling exclusively Ultralight Outdoor Gear and are able to show us that they are Experts in their field. Ultralight Outdoor Gear has the lightest list this time around, being very close to the 4 kg mark, while Trekking-Lite-Store.com has the most affordable list at 2.085,00 €.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40337489450" title="Chilling at Sunset"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/976/40337489450_c4f9faa8f6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Chilling at Sunset" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I found it very interesting to see how the weights in some categories went quite a lot down in the past five years, especially the rainwear. Where in 2014 a 350-ish gram rain jacket was ultralight, we now can get fully waterproof rainjackets and pants which are under 100 g! For a pair of garments which in the ideal case are 95% of the time in our backpack that is ideal and allows us to drop some 500 g of weight from our packs!</p>

<p>A difference to 2014 is also that we see nowadays a lot more European Cottage Brands in these lists, from Liteway, As Tucas and GramXpert to Cumulus, which means that the ultralight segment in Europe is still growing and allows these brands to succeed in the market with high-quality gear which lasts for many years. I am very happy about that, as it means more people can follow their passion and break out of the 9-to-5 grind and working to make others rich.</p>

<p>And with that our <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/one-stop-shop-2019/">One Stop Shop Series</a> of 2019 comes to an end! Thank you for following along, I hope you found the lists interesting and found out about some interesting items here and there - I for one can’t wait to pick up a rain pants and jacket which tip the scales at sub-200 g!

<p>The idea of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/one-stop-shop-2019/">One Stop Shop</a> is to buy all your gear at one shop. It saves the hassle of searching many different shops, saves on shipping [which in turn is good for the environment] and also purchasing in many different currencies like £, $ and €. The downside is that if you definitely want to have those Houdini trousers and fleece and the shop you purchase everything else from doesn’t carry them, well, you might just need to pick a pants from Black Diamond, Arc’teryx or Rab instead. Ah well. Here is the list I came up with if I’d buy the equipment and apparel at many different shops instead [please keep in mind that I adjusted the prices in this table to show the actual shipping, where applicable, which I’d need to pay to get it to my home in Finland, and I converted all currencies to €]:</p>

<p>My thoughts on my own list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I picked the Hyperlite Mountain Gear 2400 Porter because it’s a pack I really like. It’s super simple yet durable and carries well. It does lack side pockets for my water bottles, but I have used this pack on plenty of trips and don’t mind to stop, put down the pack and get my water out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/as-tucas-sestrals-quilt.html">As Tucas Sestrals Quilt</a> is currently my go-to quilt when I go backpacking between spring and autumn. It’s a tad warm with the APEX 200 insulation I have, but I’m rather warm than too cold. The quilt works well with the UberLite, as I have tested on my trip in the Pyrenees last autumn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I chose a bivy + tarp as it is my favourite way to sleep outside. The weight and price is listed together, the Hyperlite Mountain Gear Echo 2 tarp on its own is 264 g and costs $ 355,00. The beauty about this setup is that it’s very versatile and can be pitched in small spaces, and works well with the trekking poles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tend to switch things up stove and cooking wise, and if the weather is good I go for my Esbit setup as it’s tiny and UL. When I go with friends, family or if the weather is crap I like to use a gas stove, too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rest of the kitchen setup is pretty much what I always have with me when I go out. The knife is the heavy stand-out, but as I often need a proper knife for starting a fire I like the Eldris.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clothing, with exception of the rain gear and the Arc’teryx Palisade Pants, is what I wear when I’m out. I have used the Palisades pants in the past and rate it high, but nowadays use the Houdini Motion Light Pants, though that one isn’t available anymore.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For rain clothes I picked what pretty much every shop has recommended, a Ultralight combination of pants and jacket which tip the scales at about 200 g. The rain jacket and pants I currently use are SIGNIFICANTLY heavier so an UL alternative like these listed are very welcome.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a La Sportiva Ambassador I picked the Mutant for 3-season use, it’s one of my favourite La Sportiva shoes around.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And then some tried and trusted accessories to help with hiking and illumination!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall this list has the potential to still cut down quite a bit of weight - there are lighter fleece jackets out there, lighter knives and backpacks, but this is gear I own and would buy again as I know it works well for me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What also becomes apparent is that I have created the most expensive list yet, at a tad over 3.000 € it is pretty pricey. Only part can be blamed on shipping costs, but e.g. picking up a bivy <strong>and</strong> cuben tarp is much more expensive than some other options which we have seen in the series.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyway, this is my Multi-Shop-Stop list! It orders gear from 8+ companies and includes gear from several companies where I am an Ambassador (Houdini and La Sportiva) and companies where I have worked together with [As Tucas, Hyperlite Mountain Gear, Therm-A-Rest, Petzl]. Nevertheless, if I’d need to go out and buy all my gear again, this would pretty much be the list!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Keep in mind that these lists are suggestions!</em> If you are already hiking &amp; backpacking you do not need to buy everything in one go but can replace gear slowly, and this lists merely should show you that you can purchase a complete Ultralight Backpacking Setup from one store - or in this case, from 8 different ones.

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/2WipRUU">Garage Grown Gear</a> was founded in 2014 and since then has helped cottage manufacturers to grow and building a community of like-minded people. They do so by literally being a One Stop Shop for us, as we can buy anything from a cool <a href="http://bit.ly/2WffKjK">Fanny Bag</a> to trailrunning shoes and skiing gloves to heaps and heaps of cool ultralight gear from up-and-coming makers. The GGG Team is very passionate about cottage gear and helping small businesses grow and develop innovative &amp; unique kit, so that’s exactly what we are finding in their One Stop Shop list:</p>

<p>My thoughts on the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This is the cheapest Price per g list yet, with an amazing price of 0,43 € per gram of kit!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a really good list with many items which we already have seen more often in this year’s series, like the Hyperlite Mountain Gear pack and the SMD shelter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Big 3 in this list bring together 2.500 g on the scales, with the kitchen adding 391 g and the accessories 401 g to the Baseweight of 3.292 g</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Big 3 are solid choices, with a really good <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/enlightened-equipment-revelation-quilts.html">Enlightened Equipment quilt</a>, a comfy and affordable sleeping mat, and a tent which should work well from early spring thill late autumn</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I really like the inclusion of a woodstove in the kitchen setup, the Hexagon folds flat and allows you to pick up your fuel at your camping spot instead of carrying it with you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The apparel is a light 1.701 g and it’s pretty cool to see so many new items like the Enlightened Equipment skirt and Wind Shirt, and the down jacket looks really toasty</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once more a fantastic list which is ultralight and what I like best, it has gear from over a dozen cottage manufacturers!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Keep in mind that these lists are suggestions!</em> If you are already hiking &amp; backpacking you do not need to buy everything in one go but can replace gear slowly, and this lists merely should show you that you can purchase a complete Ultralight Backpacking Setup from one store. Read Carsten’s take on this list in German at <a href="">Fastpacking.de</a>.</p>

<p>My thoughts on the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A complete list with clothes and everything that tops out with a Baseweight of 2.838 g is pretty great (the garments and shoes are 1.903 g)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Quilt might be a bit cold for some, but with a comfy fleece jacket and a toasty puffy jacket you can pimp the sleep setup easily to make it handle colder temperatures</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nice to see a SMD shelter in this list, it is a pretty affordable tent that’s also spacious enough to get all your kit in it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A solid Alcohol setup for the kitchen, though again I personally don’t like Titanium cups for my ☕️</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Zajo Bjorn Merino garments are new too me, though these Corespun garments look great</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Popular choices for the apparel, Cumulus, Montane and inov-8 we have seen quite a few time in this One Stop Shop Series so you know they are light and good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall an interesting list with some choices which we haven’t seen yet and also some regulars!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Keep in mind that these lists are suggestions!</em> If you are already hiking &amp; backpacking you do not need to buy everything in one go but can replace gear slowly, and this lists merely should show you that you can purchase a complete Ultralight Backpacking Setup from one store.

<p>Henrik and the <a href="https://www.trekking-lite-store.com/sPartner=HIF2017">trekking-lite-store.com</a> are one of my oldest partners - they have been supporting me since many, many years. I <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/09/interview-henrik-ra-mann-from-trekking-lite-store-com.html">interviewed Henrik in 2010</a> as they just opened and the they were also along in the first One Stop Shop Series in 2014 - here’s <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/one-stop-shop-trekking-lite-store-dot-com.html">their list from back then</a>. Since the beginning they offered ultralight gear from the USA and big brands, and slowly more and more brands can be found at this fine shop, from Gregory to Sea to Summit to Vargo. What is also very nice is that it’s easy to sort products here, from lightest to heaviest item. So lets see what we find in this list that they sent us:</p>

<p>My thoughts on the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>With a Baseweight of 2.351 g this is a really nice light list, with a good selection of garments and shoes which make it another really light list, which is at a tad over 2k also reasonably cheap. A price per gram of 0,49 € is also quite good!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I like the choice of backpack, it’s made in Europe and packs quite a nice set of features. It’s also great to see both Cumulus and GramXpert in this list, both are small European cottages that make great gear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>EOE makes some of the lightest gas stoves on the market, and this complete kitchen setup tips the scales at 264 g, which is great. There’s some affordable &amp; light kit in this kitchen. like the Primus Spork and the Fold Cup!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A classic set of UL garments there with exception of the shoes maybe, Patagonia, Rab, OMM and Montane all are great brands which make high-quality garments and that selection should suit one well. The Columbia shoes I know Carsten will value, as he’s a fan of these kind of shoes!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And the accessories are also solid choice which are both light and also should be fairly durable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall a nice list that is easy to adapt to personal tastes or the trip at hand, be it with a larger or lighter backpack, another shelter or a different stove!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
