    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might recall that I boycotted the new <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/06/why-i-am-boycotting-the-new-ispo-summer-show.html">OutDoor by ISPO</a> this year for various reasons, though my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/lighthiker">Lighthiker</a> lives in Munich and went to visit the show. Here are his impressions from a stroll over the fair, with very little gear focus (that comes later!).</p>

<p><strong>Twice every year</strong> the professional Outdoor industry (= brands and dealers) meet at a fair to present the next season goods and allow the dealers to order. Since many years the winter fair took place in Munich and the summer one in Friedrichshafen at lake Constance. Since this year both fairs are in Munich. I’m visiting the summer edition since at least ten years and you could feel the nostalgia leaving Friedrichshafen and the anxiety what Munich will be like last year. This year all will be new and exciting, right? Well, not everyone buys into that and Hendrik himself decided to go somewhere else this year and skip the fair for a good number of reasons.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48322262821/in/dateposted/" title="OutDoor By ISPO 2019"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48322262821_857fe6b768_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="OutDoor By ISPO 2019" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I live in Munich anyhow and the fair area is literally next door so it was a no brainer for me to go there. So was it worthwhile? Actually it did not feel that much different. In its core the fair remains as it was: An industry gathering, looking at what the competition does and hoping to leave with full order books. But the vibe felt a bit different this year. Less relaxed, not such a familiar atmosphere compared to Friedrichshafen. Business itself felt even more in the forefront than ever. On the other end you could see all the well-known brand names, the floor space was much wider, the AC and the Wifi was actually working. You had small relaxation areas and opportunities to buy finger food in each hall. The lectures and presentations took place in the middle of the halls and not in separate areas or in the corners like in Friedrichshafen. The lake outside in Friedrichshafen moved indoors in Munich, and in-between two halls they put a Bavarian “beer garden” as you would expect when you stay in Munich. The mandatory outside area was essentially a car park area outside of the halls, it was not the place you want to be and smaller compared to Friedrichshafen - I hope next year they will move it into an area in-between the halls as well.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48322337607/in/dateposted/" title="OutDoor By ISPO 2019"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48322337607_df1b9c6a29_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="OutDoor By ISPO 2019" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The basic setup of the halls remained the same. You had areas where the Scandinavian and UK brands where close together you had the tent hall, climbing and shoe sections. All felt familiar. On the other hand the hallways where much wider and it felt more lofty. The organizers added a “Basecamp of Inspiration” area into one of the halls giving Outdoor Startups the possibility the present their innovations. I found this was always a missing piece in Friedrichshafen and whilst some of the companies showed products where at least I had a hard time seeing the relation with the Outdoors it was great to look outside the box.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48322258371/in/dateposted/" title="OutDoor By ISPO 2019"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48322258371_a90f289ddb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="OutDoor By ISPO 2019" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The number of the prestigious Outdoor Awards grew significantly this year. On top of the “Gold Winners” in 17 different categories they nominated 20 “Winner” winners. Amongst those two from Six Moon Designs (the Lunar Solo and Gatewood Cape) stood out for me. First of all an UL cottage company and second they won the price twelve and ten years after those products have been introduced into the market. Whilst they fully deserved it I was joking with the company representative that it only needs more than a decade for UL companies to receive the recognition they deserve. There also was a “Blogger and Influencer Lounge” as well. Sadly not much more than a separate area where you could sit and have some ad-hoc meetings. Here I missed the public talks and the buzzing atmosphere from Friedrichshafen.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48322229486/in/dateposted/" title="OutDoor By ISPO 2019"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48322229486_971a566b6c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="OutDoor By ISPO 2019" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48322273661/in/dateposted/" title="OutDoor By ISPO 2019"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48322273661_3c943e87c4_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="OutDoor By ISPO 2019" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>One thing stood out though: Aside some major brands missing almost all booths, especially from the large brands where significantly smaller. It was obvious that the Munich fair charges more for the booth space. This and the fact that Munich in general is one if not the most pricey city in Germany makes a booth and sending people over more costly which brings me to the visitors. While Sunday was a day when it was nearly empty, Monday saw the average number of visitors compared to Friedrichshafen. I’m curious if the expectations from the brands and dealers will be fulfilled in the end. For sure whilst I saw a lot of similarities compared to Friedrichshafen you could also see new developments but the question remains if a traditional fair is nowadays still the right form of bringing the business together. A lot of the brands present their new articles to their dealers in their own format allowing them enough time in their home setting to get their messaging across. With the US counterpart fairs, the OR shows in Denver, taking place shortly before Munich now a lot of the novelties mainly from US brands have already been released. Especially those brands are on a kind of roadshow for at least two weeks across two continents and the question is if that makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>So… a lot of same, same. Something different (mostly in a positive way) but will that be enough that companies will continue to spend their money for such a show? The future will tell as always…</p>

<h2 id="outro">Outro</h2>

<p>Lighthiker’s generell impressions from the fair mirror what I have heard from other friends and <a href="https://www.auf-den-berg.de/outdoor-ausrustung/outdoor-by-ispo-muenchen/">blogger</a> <a href="https://happyhiker.de/outdoor-by-ispo-nachhaltigkeit/">colleagues</a> who have visited the show in Munich: Some things were an improvement over Friedrichshafen, while other things were not so good. While the ISPO themselves present numbers which make it look like there were an equal amount of visitors as in the past, the comments from various people that visited the fair was that it was amazingly quite. Many missed the atmosphere from Lake Constance and the nearby Alps, and for me it was also positive to hear that many missed a much better Blogger Base (which also was hidden away in the furthest corner of the fair) and programme, though some of the Blogger Walks have been good and the Blogger Party and Get-Together must have been enjoyable. Coupled with the recent News that the <a href="https://www.sazsport.de/markt-sortimente/messe-friedrichshafen/friedrichshafen-verschiebt-outdoor-messe-1730381.html">Messe Friedrichshafen postponed their new Outdoor Fair to 2020</a> probably means that at least for now I might be visiting the fair next year…?!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Usually around this time of the year I would be finalizing meetings for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqEBC4yj3FahiOhGKjMrDf0AYOmUGyDq2">OutDoor in Friedrichshafen</a>, but as last year the European Outdoor Group and it’s members voted for leaving the beautiful Lake Constance and the Alps for the busy city of Munich I will not be travelling to the European Summer show. I doubt I’ll miss much, though, as many companies will also not attend this new show.</p>

<p>I am now on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">Patreon</a>. If you feel that you get value out of my articles and videos - <strong>become a Patron for as low as a cup of coffee!</strong></p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C6qMIu-zluM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Sort of a <strong>Disclosure</strong> to start this article, though this is also a good first reason why I will not be attending the new show in Munich. I’m a Founder of the <a href="http://www.outdoor-blogger-network.com">Outdoor Blogger Network</a> and our company was an official partner of the OutDoor in Friedrichshafen. We have worked for three years with the Messe Friedrichshafen on making companies aware of the benefits of online content creators - all the Bloggers, Youtubers and Instagrammers which we welcomed on the Blogger Base, where we offered them a place to network, meet companies and fellow Influencers, write articles, edit videos, charge their gadgets and learn new things in our keynote presentations.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34734971973/in/album-72157685424312086/" title="Pata Degermann speaking on the OutDoor Stage"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4281/34734971973_84863f7014_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Pata Degermann speaking on the OutDoor Stage" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This Blogger Base and our programme - it included daily blogger walks and presentations - was a huge hit with all OutDoor Attendees. For example, over the last years we welcomed Adventurer <a href="https://www.alastairhumphreys.com">Alastair Humphreys</a>, Photographer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/harritarvainen/">Harri Tarvainen</a>, Liz Carlson, the <a href="http://youngadventuress.com">Young Adventuress</a>, and Lawyer <a href="https://cms.law/de/DEU/People/Martin-Gerecke">Martin Gerecke</a>, amongst many others. Not only did these fantastic speakers enlighten us with their talks, they also came to mingle with content creators at the Blogger Base where we had our own amazing little Café, with comfy seats for chatting and plenty of power outlets!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34734958003/in/album-72157685424312086/" title="Alastair Humphreys on the OutDoor Stage"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4213/34734958003_7e3324c12d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Alastair Humphreys on the OutDoor Stage" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now after the move was announced our company approached the Messe München and we tried to work with them on creating a similarly welcoming environment for content creators at the new show. However, the Messe München exists in a parallel universe where everything they touch is amazing and hence they decided after several talks that they don’t need OBN for the new Outdoor fair, even if this would ensure that there would be continuity in at least one aspect of the show after the move from Friedrichshafen to Munich. From my experiences at the Winter ISPO show and the <em>“Blogger Programme”</em> which is offered there I think that this will be end of a great Blogger Base, which is not only sad for our company, but especially for the content creators which have visited us at the show. So this is one reason why I will be boycotting the new show - not because I am sour that the Messe München didn’t want to cooperate with us, but also for many other reasons, which follow.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42947923162/in/album-72157670491295278/" title="Title coming soon...."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1767/42947923162_7eb80bc9a9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Title coming soon...." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="many-companies-are-not-going">Many Companies are not going</h2>

<p>The new Outdoor Show (the official name is <em>Outdoor by ISPO</em>) is a lot more expensive for companies to attend. Yes, Munich is slightly easier to reach than Friedrichshafen, but the prices are ridiculous, both for a booth at the show and for accommodation, food and transportation in the city. The costs for a booth at the new fair are significantly higher than they were in Friedrichshafen, and if you add in higher accommodation and food costs then you quickly understand why many companies are skipping the new show in Munich. No matter the location, these trade shows have lost their importance over the last years, as the shows are too late in the order cycle for many retailers to view &amp; order the new gear (this happens earlier in the year), so it is understandable that many companies skip it now where it is just a really expensive marketing event.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34702820614/in/album-72157685424312086/" title="Smoothies at the Houdini Booth"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4238/34702820614_4be54a8bbc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Smoothies at the Houdini Booth" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="i-dont-like-munich">I don’t like Munich</h2>

<p><em>Munich is such a nice city</em> is what I hear when I talk with people. Well, I disagree. It’s a massive city with millions of people, and while I have many friends there who make being in that city bearable I really don’t care much for it. It’s loud, dirty, far from nature (the English Garden doesn’t count for me) and expensive. And one of the worst things about the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/03/ispo-2019.html">ISPO</a> is always the getting there, as the Metro will be full like a tin can of sardines in the mornings and evenings. Now this is a uncomfortable experience when it is 5°C outside, but I don’t want to imagine how it will be when it is a summer-y 35°C. Sweaty, maybe?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35376626162/in/album-72157685424312086/" title="Best Booth of the Fair: The Houdini Garden"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4229/35376626162_33cd381407_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Best Booth of the Fair: The Houdini Garden" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="its-hard-work">It’s hard work</h2>

<p>Attending a trade show means for me around 10 to 12 meetings a day, running on the fair from 9 in the morning till 18 in the evening, and then usually still having some informal meetings at the After-Parties. While there always are discussions about cooperations and such at the show, I don’t really earn money with it (if we don’t count the minimal Ad Revenue from the ads on my YT Videos). Which means for me the attendance of a show was more spending money than earning with it, though at least in Friedrichshafen my costs where minimal and I could go swim in the Lake after the show.</p>

<h2 id="theres-enough-bloggers-living-in-munich">There’s enough Bloggers living in Munich</h2>

<p>Munich is home to many outdoor enthusiasts. You have the amazing <a href="https://www.munichmountaingirls.de">Munich Mountain Girls</a> (I’m a huge fan!), the wonderful <a href="https://fraeulein-draussen.de">Fräulein Draussen</a> lives close by, as well as Uli from <a href="https://www.auf-den-berg.de">Auf-den-Berg.de</a>, Andreas from <a href="https://gipfelfieber.com">Gipfelfieber</a> and many more. These great people live in Munich and it’s easy enough for them to visit the show without all the hassle and costs which such a visit would mean for me, and that means you can follow these people to find out about shiny new kit from them!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/35376671012/in/album-72157685424312086/" title="New Paramo Manu Shirt"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4262/35376671012_3256998877_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="New Paramo Manu Shirt" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="i-can-go-outdoors">I can go outdoors!</h2>

<p>I am a gear-nerd, but I like being outdoors even more. Not going to the show means I can use the time to spend it with my family, go hiking and camping, play games and enjoy the summer in Finland. That’s a big plus, and another good reason for me to not go to Munich!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48043214063/in/dateposted/" title="#OutdoorCoffee!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48043214063_299e1eb743_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="#OutdoorCoffee!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="theres-always-the-new-outdoor-in-friedrichshafen-or-or-in-the-">There’s always the new OutDoor in Friedrichshafen, or OR in the 🇺🇸</h2>

<p>As you see, there are for me many reasons why I am boycotting the new Outdoor show. There’s no appreciation for bloggers and neither a good programme from the Messe Munich (when compared to what was offered at #OutDoorFN), it’s expensive to visit, many companies I want to meet are not going either, and there’s plenty of people living in and around Munich for whom it’s easier to visit the new show and test the waters. Also, there’s the new <a href="http://www.outdoor-friedrichshafen.com">Outdoor Friedrichshafen</a> Show in September and the <a href="https://www.outdoorretailer.com">Outdoor Retailer</a> in the USA which are interesting and would offer me to meet new companies and people, and both cities have amazing outdoor playgrounds on their doorstep! So all in all, I’m happy that I get to enjoy an extra summer week outdoors and save a lot of money. However, I will keep an eye out on the channels of my friends in Munich and hear what they will report, and then I might reconsider a visit in 2020 😊</p>
