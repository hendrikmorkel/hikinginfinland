<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I bought the <a href="https://www.lasportiva.com/en/crossover-20-gtx">La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX</a> in April 2018, and have used them since then pretty much on every backpacking trip: <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/microadventure-sipoonkorpi-national-park.html">Sipoonkorpi National Park</a>, at <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/09/camp-ousland.html">Camp Ousland</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/Zr6Ev1MFxBw">Backpacking in Vålådalen</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/m8EstxnC8uQ">Backpacking in the Pyrenees</a> and also on my <a href="https://youtu.be/-AYVkZf61UE">backpacking trip in Hammastunturi Wilderness</a>. Additionally, in winter I also use these shoes all the time, so they easily have seen over 360 days of use so far, and I estimate that I have hiked over 1.500 km in them.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>Shoes give you protection and grip on your hiking &amp; backpacking trips, and depending on the environment you are likely to pick different shoes: If I’m hiking in super-warm weather the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals OSO</a> are my pick, if I am in the mountains I usually opt for an <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/08/la-sportiva-tx2-review.html">approach shoe like the TX2</a>, and if I’m hiking in the autumn off-the-beaten track or expect wet and cold weather, then I put on the Crossover 2.0 GTX as they keep my feet drier and warmer than an unlined shoe.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Integrating a gaiter into a running shoe isn’t new, but La Sportiva has done an absolute amazing job with this shoe as it is durable in all aspects which matter to me.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48744150896/in/album-72157710871736122/" title="Hammastunturi Wilderness"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48744150896_7c8434f706_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hammastunturi Wilderness" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>I have used this shoe for almost two years in autumn, winter and spring, in the Pyrenees, Finnish swamps, on snow &amp; asphalt and forest trails and have never found anything wrong with them. They’re always comfortable for my feet with a good fit in the heel, and the toe box is wide enough to accommodate my toes. The zipper holds up AMAZINGLY well, and still functions flawless. Also the heel - commonly an area where you see the wear &amp; tear first - is still without any damage. And I have been hiking a lot off-trail with these shoes, though shrubbery and whatnot, and the upper + gaiter still look in great shape.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>One shoe weighs in at 358 g in Size 42 which makes the pair 716 g heavy.</p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.lasportiva.com/en/one-percent-for-the-planet">La Sportiva is a 1% For The Planet Member</a>, and they have a <a href="https://www.lasportiva.com/en/recycle-program">Recycle Program</a> for the waste resulting from their manufacturing process in Val di Fiemme. The company is <a href="https://www.lasportiva.com/en/environmental-care">ISO 14.001 certified</a> and all that and more you can read in their <a href="https://www.lasportiva.com/en/csr">Sustainability Report</a>. BUT how do you <em>“recycle”</em> your La Sportiva shoes at the end of their life-cycle? In most countries shoes belong into the residual waste bin. Or if they still have some life left in them, you can drop them into a clothing recycling bin or donate them to a place which takes old clothes and shoes. You also can look for the shop or place which is part of the <a href="https://www.nike.com/sustainability">Reuse-A-Shoe program</a>, where they recycle your sneakers and transform them into Nike Grind material.</p>

<p>As always, this is the most important part of the whole article - get a cup of coffee and then read on.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/40337489450" title="Chilling at Sunset"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/976/40337489450_c4f9faa8f6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Chilling at Sunset" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>First things first: This is a Gore-Tex shoe, but that does not mean that I always had dry feet in them. If it are good, clear trails and it’s raining - dry feet, <em>mucho awesome</em>. Hiking through shrubbery, overgrown paths and through grass heavy with dew or wet from the rain, expect to have wet feet in a few minutes. The inner material also holds on to wetness well, so once the shoes are wet they are wet till you’re drying them over a stove. The wet shoes are not really a problem if you have some good <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/02/wrightsock-review.html">Merino Wool Socks</a> on and have the <em>hiking in wet shoes is not a problem</em> mind set, but it’s something I need to mention. Gore-Tex or waterproofness in shoes in general only goes so far really, but for me the benefit of having dry &amp; warm feet in the rain, when the trail conditions are right, outweigh the downside of hiking in a wet Gore-Tex shoe that needs longer to dry. I have found that drying the shoes overnight next to a wood stove is possible, and also in the tent they do dry out a wee bit if the air is not really saturated with moisture.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49622385937/in/dateposted-public/" title="Drying in the sun"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49622385937_4b31f879fa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Drying in the sun" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49621605448/in/dateposted-public/" title="Drying the La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49621605448_048c0d04c6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Drying the La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The shoe has a 10 mm Drop which is usually more than I like, but it’s still acceptable for me and as I have used these shoes so much I have got used to it. I also don’t particularly like that La Sportiva has used in the inner construction a material which holds moisture so long, I wish they would have used something more meshy that dries super-fast. But as this shoe is intended for winter trailrunning I get why they have made the shoe warmer instead of more breathable. It being a “warm” shoe also means that it isn’t really suitable to really warm weather - for me the ideal temperature to use the shoe is between -5°c and 15°C. If it is more than 15°C I get really warm and sweaty feet, on the other side of the thermometer it’s not a problem to take the shoes down to -15°C and still have toasty feet.</p>

<p>Grip wise these shoes are absolutely fantastic. Wet rocks in the Pyrenees, boulder-hoping down a field of scree: No problem. Traversing wet swamps: No Problem. Hiking on forest trails with roots and stones: Ideal terrain. Snow: Hi there, I’m at home here. The Crossover has superb grip thanks to it profile and the La Sportiva FriXion AT Sole. On wet boulders I am more careful than with a Vibram Megagrip sole, but I haven’t slipped on wet rocks yet. Given how much I have used these shoes I also am super-happy with the durability of the soles, they still have a few longer backpacking trips in them.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743965103/in/album-72157710871736122/" title="Hammastunturi Wilderness"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743965103_54ef2c5fa5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hammastunturi Wilderness" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49621607523/in/dateposted-public/" title="La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX Sole"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49621607523_9dff1ecd9c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX Sole" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The integrated gaiter of the Crossover 2.0 is what gives this shoe a great advantage over normal trailrunning shoes in my opinions - the zipper is really well designed, the gaiter can be adjusted in width (tightness) at the top so it doesn’t slip down, and the material keeps rain, snow and debris like dirt and small stones out of your shoe. It also gives the shoe a great look, and I wear the shoe with the laces always done and only slip in and close the gaiter, ready to go.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I know that this shoe is made for trailrunning in winter, which is why it is made warmer. I’d like to see the same shoe - maybe with a Vibram Megagrip sole for even better grip on wet rocks - with a lighter inside construction which dries faster when it is wet, and I also can imagine it’d be good to decrease the Drop to 6 mm or less. This is more wishing La Sportiva building the ideal hiking shoe for wet weather, though 😃</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I have hiked for 9+ years in unlined shoes as that’s the Ultralight Backpacking Mantra. Light shoes without a (waterproof) liner are lighter and dry faster when wet. That is true, with the caveat that it depends on the material of the shoes how quickly they will dry. But I got so frustrated year after year that I had wet feet as soon as it rained a tiny wee bit or I went slightly off-trail, that I decided I want some more protection from water - hence I bought these shoes. I don’t look back at all. I love these shoes and will purchase a 2nd pair once these are nearing the end of their lifecycle, for me they really are a fantastic pair of shoes which helps me to keep my feet dry longer, with great grip on all the terrain I backpack in, and I really love the integrated gaiter of the shoe.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you want to spend an active week of holidays in Scandinavia, Åre is the place to go: Kayaking, trailrunning, hiking, kite surfing and downhill biking are just some of the activities you can do in this wonderful little village in Western Sweden. In the autumn the village is especially pretty, as the hills with their bilberry shrubs turn red and the birches add their golden leafs for that wonderful relaxing autumn feel!</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-re-sweden">Getting to Åre, Sweden</h2>

<p>As sustainability grows more and more important to me I find it harder and harder to book a flight. While you can fly to Åre I have a <a href="https://www.wasaline.com">ferry</a> in my town, that allows me to be very quickly in Umeå, Sweden. From there I can hop on a <a href="https://www.sj.se">train</a> and be in six hours in Åre, arriving right in the centre of the village. This is a very affordable and relaxing way to travel for me, as I can watch my favourite Youtube channels, read books, plot down ideas for articles and of course study the map for my upcoming backpacking trip in Vålådalen! From Finland you can also leave from Helsinki and Turku with the <a href="https://www.tallinksilja.fi">ferry to Stockholm</a>, and then take the sleeper train to Åre - allowing you to arrive well-rested in the morning and start your day in the active outdoor capital of Sweden!</p>

<h2 id="learning-downhill-biking-at-scandinavias-largest-bike-park">Learning Downhill Biking at Scandinavia’s largest Bike Park</h2>

<p>“<em>Are you Hendrik?</em>” my Guide Jesper asked me when I entered the Skistar Shop on the Main-square of Åre. “Yes, and I’m here to learn downhill biking. And I’m afraid.” “<em>That’s good!</em>” Jesper replied, and from then on I knew I was in good hands. Odin helped me get dressed in my “full-body harness” as I referred to it, a combination of a chest and back protector, hand and elbow protectors, shin and knee protectors and of course a helmet and googles. “<em>Have you ever sat on a Full-Suspension Bike?</em>” Jesper asked me when I was dressed. “No” I replied. “<em>No Problem, I’ll teach you everything there is to know about Downhill biking, from braking, getting up the mountain with the lift and safely getting down!</em>”</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/45002158152/in/dateposted/" title="Downhill Bikes are fun!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1966/45002158152_acf8fcdc3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Downhill Bikes are fun!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<em>Have you ever sat on a Full-Suspension Bike?</em>” Jesper asked me when I was dressed. “No” I replied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After I got my full-suspension bike we headed out and up towards the lift, where we stopped on a flat space and Jesper gave me the instructions I needed to get down the mountain, from the position of my feet (parallel to the ground), how to brake (with both brakes at the same time) and where to look while riding (as far ahead as possible). Then I needed to demonstrate what I was just told, and after a couple of circles Jesper decided I was ready to hit the tracks. A short instruction on how to put the bike into the chair lift followed, though attentive staff also was on hand and ready to help in case I’d mess up (I didn’t 😊).</p>

<p>On the top of the hill it was just as easy to get the bike out and walk away, and then we were ready to drop in. “I’m still afraid” I mentioned to Jesper, upon seeing the tracks and how &amp; with what speed other bikers where racing them down. “<em>You’ll be fine. We take this slow, just brake a little all the time and you’ll just do what we talked about earlier.</em>” Jesper calmed me down, and to make it a wee bit easier we also skipped the first part of the track on this first run, and went in a wee bit further down the hill.</p>

<p>Well, it went really just as fine as Jesper said. Maybe my experience of riding bike every day, bikepacking and riding on local trails had given me a good foundation and idea on how to ride downhill, but soon I was whooping as I took a curve high and fast or racing over the narrow trails. Yes, I was braking and definitely not as fast and good as many others riding in <a href="https://aresweden.com/en/are-bike-park/">Åre Bike Park</a>, but damn did it feel good to turn that fear into confidence, joy and hollers as I was riding down Åreskutan!</p>

<p>That first day we were two and half hours out in the Bike Park, and I not only got to see the best view over Åre, but I also got to ride many different trails - from the Beginner-friendly Serpentinen to the gorgeously scenic Organic. I really was overjoyed about the experience, and even if I didn’t master the jumps very well (taking off to early, with too much speed or not landing right) it was an amazing afternoon!</p>

<p>The next day - because all good things come in pairs! - I headed back in the morning to the Ski Star Shop, and with some luck &amp; good timing Jesper and me were the first people on the lift up. There’s several chair lifts which bring bikers up the mountain, as well as the cable car, though sadly it was too windy and so the latter was grounded. That meant we wouldn’t be able to ride from the top as Jesper had planned, but he had some great trails for me to ride nevertheless. I asked if it’d be OK to ride down Serpentinen again as the first ride, so I can “<em>get back into the groove on familiar terrain</em>” and that was just what Jesper had planned.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31177213698/in/dateposted/" title="Åre Bike Park and Åresjön"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1970/31177213698_ecf52e3eb1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Åre Bike Park and Åresjön" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then we took another lift up, rode to the other side of the mountain and enjoyed another scenic trail which brought us back down to Åre. Back up Jesper decided I was ready to ride Shimano, Åre’s most famous red trail. Shortly my fear flickered back up, but with some confidence inspiring words from Jesper I dropped in. Shimano has some 50 or so jumps (and I rolled over at least 40 or so of them 😬🤣) and 20 fat bank curves where you almost ride parallel to the ground, and it’s a trail which had me hollering quite a bit when I mastered a curve or a jump! After Shimano we had a small Fika in town, and then hit the trails a few more times before it was time for me drop off my gear and bike, say many thank yous to Jesper and leave the shop with a big, fat smile!</p>

<p>Downhill biking thus. It is strangely relaxing to ride down that narrow trail, always looking far ahead, not going too slow so you can take that curve as high as possible, and also trying to taking in that amazing scenery. You life in the present, things which you had on your mind while walking to the lift - remember that fear from the beginning? - are pushed aside, to be pondered about at another time, if ever again. The focus is on the trail in front of you, and when you arrive down at the lift station - a big smile and the excitement of that adrenaline rush leaving your brain. It’s addicting, and after years of wondering what people find in this “dangerous sport”, I know: Focus, relaxation and joy.</p>

<p>(<em>And while I feel that I already have enough hobbies, I think I need to etch out some time to go more downhill biking. And maybe I need to visit the <a href="http://arebikefestival.com">Åre Bike Festival</a> in 2019!</em>)</p>

<h2 id="trailrunning-to-totthummeln">Trailrunning to Totthummeln</h2>

<p>Since the summer I am <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning</a> several times a week at home. Now, as some of you know, I life at the coast in Finland. Unlike, for example, the Norwegian coast, the Finnish coast is pretty similar to the Dutch coast. Which means it’s prettttttty flat over here. And while I run up and down several “hills” every week, these 15, 20 m of elevation did not really make me ready to run in the mountains. That’s the realization I came to when I was running with Björn up to Totthummeln, a scenic hill with a great view which lays between Åre and Björnen. We started from Granen, the Hotel I stayed at, and after a few hundred meters of asphalt we soon hit the Trollstigen Trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44138672535/in/dateposted/" title="Trailrunning on Totthummeln"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1909/44138672535_55bcb74c1a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Trailrunning on Totthummeln" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>From then on it were sweet trails that took us around the mountain, with great views over Åre, the lake and Björnen, and then up to the top of Totthummeln. Björn’s personal best time around the mountain is 35 minutes, though with my help and the visit to the summit we made it in double the time back to my Hotel… Nevertheless, it was a great run, despite the rain, and if you don’t want to run to this easy summit - you always can make it a nice day hike with the family &amp; kids!</p>

<h2 id="hiking-on-reskutan">Hiking on Åreskutan</h2>

<p>Before trailrunning with Björn I was out on my own in the morning, exploring the hiking trails of Åreskutan. There are over half a dozen trails which go up, around and across the mountain, and if you’re looking for a fun day hike - Åreskutan will not disappoint. Yes, you will cross the ski slopes once in a while, but most of the time you’ll be hiking in pretty forests on nice trails. There’s Cafés where you can enjoy a warm cup of coffee and a Kanelbullar, and if you don’t want to hike down you always can take one of the lifts back to the village. If the weather is good I can imagine that the hiking is very nice, and especially the Trollstigen Trail with it’s hidden treasures and wood nymphs is great for kids (it’s also only about a kilometre long, so also doable for 3 year olds!).</p>

<h2 id="exploring-the-village">Exploring the village</h2>

<p>After all that hiking, running and cycling I was hungry. Already before I left to Åre I heard about the <a href="http://www.creperielogi.se/are/">Åre Crêperie &amp; logi</a>, and the place did not disappoint! It was very cozy with super-friendly staff, and the Vegan Crêpes were amazing &amp; soooooo tasty. I also went and had coffee at the <a href="http://arekafferosteri.se/">Åre Kafferosteri</a> which roast their own coffee - definitely a recommndation. As a Houdini Friend I also of course had to check out the <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/se/vara-butiker?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzMDAhcXn3QIV7p3tCh2bEAokEAAYASAAEgK1s_D_BwE">Houdini Store Åre</a>, though I also went to see the Shops of Peak Performance (which was founded in Åre in 1986!), Stellar Equipment and Haglöfs! Besides these stores you’ll find a couple other sports stores, and plenty of Cafés and Bars to spend the afternoons and evenings.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-stay">Where to stay</h2>

<p>There’s over <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=-2468311&amp;aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">30 Hotels and B&amp;Bs in Åre</a>, so there’s something for each wallet. I stayed my first two nights at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/se/hotell-granen.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Hotell Granen</a> which is a wee bit up the hill and offered a scenic view. The Hotel had an amazing breakfast, was super-beautifully decorated (I would have wished I’d had more time to just lounge in the comfy chairs by the fire place and read or drink a 🥃 in the bar) and not even three minutes on foot and one was in the centre of Åre!</p>

<p>My last night in Åre I slept and dined at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/se/holiday-club-are.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Holiday Club Åre</a> which was equally impressive. This is a Holiday Club Hotel unlike any other I have seen - it’s modern, stylish and in the middle of town -  you get to the railway station via a bridge! The Holiday Club Åre has a Spa and Swimming Pool, and also is a popular Lunch place for the locals. I had twice a very delicious lunch here, and the Vegan 3-Course dinner was outstanding and so much that I couldn’t even finish my dessert! The room was very nice, I was sitting on the terrace in the sun and enjoying the view over the lake and town and a bit sad I had to leave so soon again.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping it up</h2>

<p>A holiday in Åre can be many things: Exciting, relaxing, and tasty. I so much enjoyed my days in this small ski town, which unlike many other ski towns in the Alps or Northern Europe is open year-round. That’s right - Åre’s shops &amp; hotels are open almost the whole year, and the <a href="https://www.skistar.com/en/ski-destinations/are/">cable cars and lifts</a> run in the winter, spring, summer and autumn: In the winter they bring skiers and snowboarders up the slopes, while from spring till autumn it are hikers and downhill bikers who take a ride up to Åreskutan. Add in its proximity to several beautiful nature places like Vålådalen and just a short trip to Norway, and like me, you probably soon will fall in love with the authentic vibe of this small town &amp; its friendly people and you’ll wonder: When can I come back?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ask a Swede about Åre and they will know: This is the place to be in the summer for Downhill biking, hiking, kayaking and many more outdoor activities, while in the winter this small village with it’s cozy Cafés, outdoor shops and restaurants becomes a bit bigger as people come to ski on Åreskutan and the surrounding mountains. I spent the last week in Åre and Vålådalen enjoying the Swedish nature &amp; hospitality - here is what you can expect!</p>

<p>On my first day in Åre I went hiking, trailrunning and explored the little village. Even in the off-season that is now there were plenty of people out on the mountain and in the village, and after some rain throughout the day it cleared up and became a nice evening with a spectacular sunset.</p>

<p>After 92 amazing kilometres of backpacking it was back to Åre and doing something which I have never done before: Downhill Mountain Biking. A sport I had &amp; still have a massive amount respect for, and was scared of. But with my Guide Jesper I became confident and had so much fun ripping down the trails, taking these high turns, learning to jump (still learning 😂) and feeling confident on these narrow trails. Wow, that was soooo good.</p>

<p>As I wrote <a href="">elsewhere</a>, I have fallen in love with running again this summer. I try to run three times a week, sometimes I succeed, sometimes I fail, and sometimes I run even more often. Down in Helsinki I was exploring the city during my evening runs, while here in Vaasa I stick mostly to my home round (and I have to admit, that does at times get boring, but on the other hand it is nice to see how I get faster). This goes in line in trying to build up a better level of fitness and also I am trying to lose some weight. As I have been running for the last four years or more basically in the same running shorts and shirt (and still run in them, as they still are in great shape and not broken) and only have been switching shoes, I felt that now that I run so often it’d be nice to have a second set of clothes to wear when I hit the trails when the other one is in the laundry (I do sweat a lot and while I wear them a minimum of two times and air dry them after each run, that’s about as much runs I get out of one pair of running clothes 😂). Without much further ado, I give you all the kit I use when out running!</p>

<h2 id="salomon-exo-twinskin-shorts--s-lab-exo-hz-ss-tee">Salomon Exo Twinskin Shorts &amp; S-Lab Exo Hz S/S Tee</h2>

<p>At a regular retail price of around 140 € for the shorts and 100 € for the shirt this is a piece of kit which I think is only for those who really run a lot and think they need it. A word of warning, too: These seem to not be sized correctly - I have a Size M Shirt which I barely get on and off (I usually wear Size S) and the Shorts in Size S are also a snug fit. I also got an <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/salomon-explore-s-s-tee-t-shirt/?pid=10239">Salomon Explore S/S Tee</a> and that’s true to size. Anyway, lets look a wee bit at these two exceptional pieces.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/salomon-exo-twinskin-short-running-shorts/?pid=10239">Salomon Exo Twinskin Shorts</a> are a compression tights and a shorts in one. They do their job well and if I wear these I can run longer and am less fatigued. I do think Salomon could have been more generous with the sizes of the pockets, though - there’s a tiny zippered pocket on the back and an open mesh pocket on the front. Except a key and some Gels I won’t be able to get much stored in these, which is a shame as that means for my runs I need to somehow carry the iPhone (which I need for Music) in another way (my old Arc’teryx shorts has five pockets, one of which is massive enough for the phone). It has a long list of features - Skin fit with Exo Sensifit Agility compression, 37.5 technology, 360 degree reflective details, amongst others - but in short this is a great shorts for me for the coming months when it will be a bit cooler. / <em>122 g in Size S</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30477242018/in/dateposted/" title="Stabile Seitenlage"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1850/30477242018_e69f614653_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Stabile Seitenlage" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/salomon-s-lab-exo-hz-s-s-tee-running-shirt/?pid=10239">S-Lab Exo Hz S/S Tee</a> has zero pockets, a zipper in the front which helps with venting, silicone prints on the sleeves and hem to keep the shirt in place, and then this <em>“Exe-Skeleton”</em> structure which also seems to help me to run faster and get less tired. The fabric dries really fast and does not feel moist or cold after a long run, which is pretty good as it starts to be cooler in the evenings (it’s soon autumn after all). All that said, I’m not sure if this is a shirt for every runner out there - while it certainly is great, it’s also pretty expensive. / <em>102 g in Size M</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30477246368/in/dateposted/" title="Salomon Exo Twinskin Shorts &amp; S-Lab Exo Hz S/S Tee"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1861/30477246368_3cb89165e2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Salomon Exo Twinskin Shorts &amp; S-Lab Exo Hz S/S Tee" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="salomon-s-lab-speedcross">Salomon S-Lab Speedcross</h2>

<p>I haven’t worn the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/salomon-s-lab-speedcross-trail-running-shoes/?pid=10239">Salomon S-Lab Speedcross</a> heaps as of yet, but two things: They are fast &amp; light, and they have very little ankle support. I don’t think I need to say much about the former (my pair in 42 weighs 560 g), but about that ankle support: I like to think of myself of having strong ankles, because I very seldom wear boots and pretty much all the time wear Luna Sandals, light <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/08/la-sportiva-tx2-review.html">approach shoes</a> or some other trailrunning shoe. And I don’t know if it was because it now gets earlier dark and I often run during dusk, or something else, but I have the feeling that I twist my ankle more often in these shoes. Now if I say <em>“twist my ankle”</em> I don’t mean that I injure myself, but when I am out running on my home trail then on the washed-out downhills and narrow, rocky forest path I did have a little slip of the ankle more often than in other shoes I have worn this summer. Another <em>design flaw</em> in my opinion is that the pocket for the laces is a wee bit too long, it makes it more difficult to store the laces in it. Other than that I really like these shoes (they’re light! they’re fast!) and will continue to run in them, after which I might follow up on the thing with the ankles. / <em>560 g for the pair in Size 42</em></p>

<h2 id="suunto-spartan-ultra-all-black-hr">Suunto Spartan Ultra All Black HR</h2>

<p>I admit that before I owned the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/suunto-spartan-ultra-black-multi-function-watch/?pid=10239">Suunto Spartan Ultra All Black HR</a> I didn’t use a watch at all - the Apps and clock on my iPhone where good enough. But about two years ago Suunto sent me this watch, and it has been on my wrist ever since. It does a lot of good things for me - it counts my steps each day and hence reminding me to walk more, it has GPS for backpacking and several functions which I value. But for running I really love it, as together with the HR Belt I can keep an eye on my heart rate and get an idea how well I am doing. It is paired with the Movescount App on the phone and when I am back from a run it doesn’t take me long to have my run online, and I usually share it also with my brother so we keep each other motivated to go running =) This is likely for the vast majority the last bit of kit which should be considered (as Apps on phones can do almost all of what the watch does, too). / <em>75 g for the Watch and 44 g for the HR Belt</em></p>

<h2 id="inov-8-socks">Inov-8 Socks</h2>

<p>If you wear shoes, you’re likely also wearing socks. My <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/running-socks/?pid=10239">running socks</a> of choice right now are from <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/brands/inov-8/running-socks/?pid=10239">Inov-8</a>, I bought these several years ago and they work well for me - they’re a low cut, light, dry quick and don’t smell too bad after one run. / <em>36 g in Size M</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44343934321/in/dateposted/" title="Inov-8 Socks"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1860/44343934321_cb7d4c65cd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Inov-8 Socks" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="inov-8-race-ultra-hydration-system">Inov-8 Race Ultra Hydration System</h2>

<p>I also refer to this as my <em>Waterbottle Thingy</em> but inov-8 calls this a <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/inov-8-race-ultra-hydration-system/?pid=10239">Hydration System</a>. I bought this as I don’t want to always carry a pack, belt or vest when I go running, and this works really well for me. You strap it to your hand, put the bottle in [I bought the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/inov-8-softflask-05-folding-bottle/?pid=10239">500 ml soft flask</a> because that 250 ml bottle it comes with is a joke] and running I go. The 500 ml flask is good for an hour of running, anything longer and I likely will take a vest or belt to stay hydrated. In the <em>Waterbottle Thingy</em> there’s two small pockets so I also can put a key safely away and carry a gel. Pretty handy, and despite my concerns that it might not be comfortable or such, I have been running all summer with it and find it fantastic. / <em>19 g for the strap, 29 g for the empty 500 ml soft flask</em></p>

<h2 id="salomon-air-logo-cap-and-active-gloves">Salomon Air Logo Cap and Active Gloves</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/salomon-active-glove-gloves/?pid=10239">Active Gloves</a> haven’t seen any use yet, but I expect them to come in handy when it will be single digits in the mornings and evenings when I head out for a run. They allow me to use the phone and are light at 34 g, now I just need to see if they keep my fingers warm and if they’re not too hot to make my hands sweat! / <em>34g in Size L</em></p>

<p>I wish I would have bought the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/marken/salomon/?pid=10239">Air Logo Cap</a> earlier. It is really breathable with the mesh back, reasonably light at 44 g and most importantly, it is comfortable, all day long. I tried another cap earlier in the summer and was disappointed, but this one is really good and I reckon it will also come along on backpacking trips with me. / <em>44 g</em></p>

<h2 id="other-shoes">Other shoes</h2>

<p>I have written in my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/gear-outtakes-summer-2018.html">Gear Outtakes</a> article about a few other trailrunning shoes I have used this summer, all of which I have liked. Each pair seems to excel in different conditions, and some of the shoes I got (like the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/s/La--Sportiva--VK/category--outdoor-shoes/?pid=10239">La Sportiva VK</a>) really are superb shoes for my local trails, while some other ones I will be using when I go running in the mountains later in the autumn. I might follow this article up with another article before the winter when I have ran a decent amount of kilometres in each pair.</p>

<h2 id="petzl-nao">Petzl NAO+</h2>

<p>I have used the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/petzl-nao-headlamp-bf/?pid=10239">NAO+</a> for a long time (I was a Beta tester for it) and still find it my favourite lamp for running and other activities when it gets dark (hiking, cycling, ice climbing and ski-touring, for example). At 195 g it is not the lightest headlamp out there, but with a maximum of 750 lumen it illuminates the trails really well and I don’t need to worry about not seeing a root or slippery rock. It sits secure on my head, the weight is well distributed and it’s easy to control the lamp via the iPhone app to change settings. If you run in the dark and want a light that adjusts it’s output depending on where you look - this is the one you want! / <em>195 g</em></p>

<h2 id="jaybird-freedom-2-headphones-buff-and-oakley-latch-shades">Jaybird Freedom 2 Headphones, BUFF and Oakley Latch Shades</h2>

<p>I don’t run without music. I find it helps me to lose my mind when running, power up hills and get energy when I think I can’t continue anymore. In the middle of the summer I got the <a href="http://bit.ly/2PMkyLz">Jaybird Freedom 2 Headphones</a> and it has been such an update from the standard iPhone headphones. The latter had the cable, but the Jaybird Freedome 2 are wireless which is such a treat. On a full charge they play music for 4 hours, the block out noise really well, and they don’t have trouble with sweat as they’re Sweat-proof &amp; water resistant. The headphones come with several interchangeable tips and fins which makes getting a perfect fit with them a breeze - and most importantly, they sound fantastic! (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX06VUQ1GoKge?si=sWCKALEKRWy4kl8E0nj_1A">This is the playlist I mostly listen too when running</a>) / <em>20 g incl. the clip</em></p>

<p>My <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/buff-original-buff-multi-function-bandana/?pid=10239">BUFF</a> is ancient and I use it mainly to keep the sweat from my face and the hair outta my eyes. On those super-sunny runs it also helps protect my head from the sun, and after the run it’s easy to wipe the sweat and grime off with it. When it will turn colder it can function has a beanie or around my neck, making this a great multi-use piece throughout the year. / <em>44 g</em></p>

<p>My <a href="http://bit.ly/2olyUWR">Oakley Latch Shades</a> I bought early in the winter of 2018 and boy do I love them. They’re small in size and fit my head well, they really are anti-fog as they’re pretty open and yes, they also look cool. They are very light, super comfortable for all-day long use (and I do use them all the time when I am outside) and when I run they sit securely on my head in combination with the Buff. In the forest they keep pine needles, leaves and twigs outta my eyes, and out in the open the sun and it’s UV rays have no chance of getting into my eyes. / <em>22 g</em></p>

<h2 id="energy-for-my-runs">Energy for my runs</h2>

<p>I have used these <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/clif-bar-shot-gel-razz-energy-gel/?pid=10239">Clifbar Gels</a> and <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/clif-bar-shot-margarita-citrus-energy-gel/?pid=10239">Bloks</a> for many years now and like them, but as I am slowly transforming my diet (I aim to be Vegan, nutrition-wise, by the end of the year) I hope to find something which suits me better. I tried Trailbutter at the #OutDoorFN and loved that, but sadly it isn’t possible to get these in Europe just yet. Thus for now I will stick to the gels and blocks from Clifbar, which I can use without much problems to my stomach or digestion, and they give me a good boost when I am out on a long run!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44343939191/in/dateposted/" title="Energy"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1852/44343939191_2cb70920c8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Energy" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>That’s it!</strong> All the gear (minus some packs, which I don’t want to write about just yet) I use when I go running. It might seem a lot, though in reality it’s a pretty lightweight and compact kit and easily always comes along on my trips where I’m not backpacking for a week. Best of all, it makes me happy to put it on, head out and get my head free when I’m running through my local forests 🏃!</p>

    <updated>2015-08-28T23:42:00+03:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you don’t know who Kilian Jornet is you have a great opportunity to get to know him in this personal look at what motivates him, why he runs and why he enjoys being outdoors.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20959699761/in/dateposted/" title="Run Or Die"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5748/20959699761_61679e92f0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Run Or Die" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>In nine chapters and 181 pages you get to know Kilian rather well. From his cycling adventures with his mom and sister, training for races and what goes on in his mind when he runs and competes. I don’t really like competitions, especially in the outdoors, but still found it interesting to read &amp; understand what drives him to go stand in a line and compete. I could very well relate to the difficulty at times to overcome one’s inner swine which just wants to stay in bed or chill on the sofa instead of going out for training, but Kilian trains (or competes) 360 days per year so I think many of use can learn in that department something from him!</p>

<p>The book is written in a pleasant way which is easy to read. Kilian takes you on a journey from his days as a child over his youth to a love story and onwards to the Western States Endurance and a run up &amp; down Kilimanjaro. You learn about his preparation for races, his music taste, where he loves to run and what goes on in his head when he runs the UTMB and other competitions. And in the end you learn that he, like you &amp; me, also really just enjoys to be outside and be active.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20959700571/in/dateposted/" title="Run Or Die"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5622/20959700571_6f982521e4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Run Or Die" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The desire I feel is the same as I felt in the United States: I want to challenge myself, give the best of myself, and try to discover what my thresholds are, to know myself better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for whom is this book? I think it’s a good read for anyone who is interested in being outside and ponders what others think &amp; feel when being in nature. Trailrunners, ski mountaineers and fans of Kilian definitely should pick up his book, too, and learn what drives the most dominating endurance athlete of our time to push the envelope.</p>
