<p>Truth be told, because of my new job I worked out less than in the winter and spring. After a long work day I rather wanted to dive into my man cave and paint than sweat and be bothered by the Mosquitos when running. But when addnature approached me and asked if I‚Äôd be interested in a cooperation, it was a great opportunity to get back into the healthy habit of running regularly after a work day!</p>

<h2 id="ordering-from-addnature">Ordering from addnature</h2>

<p>I knew <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/">addnature</a> before, and they carry many of the brands which I value and like - La Sportiva, Houdini, Rab, Patagonia, Black Diamond, Salomon and inov-8 - so it was very easy to find gear which I liked. Ordering is easy - There‚Äôs all the usual Payment Options via Klarna and shipping was via PostNord, which was even faster than DHL: The parcel arrived in five days in Vaasa. My environmentally friendly packed addnature order arrived in a durable plastic bag, which I like a lot as these are easy to recycle and take much less space to store than a package. Anyway, everything I ordered - more on that in a moment - fitted me well so it was time to put the new kit on after a day in the office and go for a run!</p>

<h2 id="that-running-motivation">That running motivation</h2>

<p>In April I wrote about my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/04/short-runs-to-happiness.html">short runs</a> and back then I was still running in my winter running gear on old snow, ice and mud - but by the time my new running kit arrived it was full-blown spring here, and so now blooming flowers, lots of bilberries, lingonberries and green birches line the trails I run on. Oh, and then there‚Äôs Mosquitos. 2021 is a really bad Mosquito year and they are out in force here in Finland, and even if I am running they seem to be able to catch up with me and feast on my delicious blood. Maybe I need to run faster?! Anyway, running in this wonderful green nature is for me a great motivator to go out. Even if I run only 4 km being out in the green is a very positive experience for me, and helps me to recharge my mental batteries. I feel better, more relaxed and it‚Äôs good to maintain the healthy habit of being outdoors every day.</p>

<h2 id="the-fresh-new-running-gear">The fresh, new running gear</h2>

<p>I know, I know - you wanna know what I got and how I like it! So here it is üòä First I got some new running socks from Injinji - the <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/injinji-ultra-run-no-show-juoksusukat-miehet-1319725_3817369.html">Ultra Run No-Show Socks</a> and the <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/injinji-sport-original-weight-mini-crew-coolmax-socks-1234824_3508161.html">Sport Original Weight Mini-Crew CoolMax Socks</a> as I really like Injinji socks and find them super-comfortable. I really like running in the Ultra Run No-Show Socks and think I‚Äôll need to pick up another pair or two in the future for every day use and hiking. I love that it almost feels like I don‚Äôt wear socks with these Injinji socks, and that I also can wear them with my Luna Sandals. If you‚Äôre not fond of socks, you might actually find these good, so they are worth trying in my opinion. I really love them.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51279482825/in/dateposted/" title="Socks &amp; Shoes"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51279482825_e6b832bc3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Socks &amp; Shoes" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After my only <em>OK experiences</em> with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/03/all-the-shoes.html">inov-8 Mudclaw G 260</a> I decided to try the <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/inov-8-roclite-275-shoes-men-1113347_3054977.html">inov-8 RocLite G 275 Shoes</a> as I have hiked and run in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/first-look-inov-8-roclite-295.html">Roclite 295s</a> waaaaay back in time and wanted to see how I like these new version with the Graphene Sole. So far the shoes have been great - comfortable, breathable and with great grip on different surfaces. It‚Äôs to early to say anything about durability yet but at the moment it looks like these are a keeper and more durable than the Mudclaws. I think also for hiking these will be great, the lugs are not as deep as on the Mudclaws so I expect them to be both more durable and long-lasting while still giving me good traction on difficult terrain.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51278629323/in/dateposted/" title="Sticky Soles"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51278629323_75b5855032_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sticky Soles" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51277710592/in/dateposted/" title="Rocks and Needles"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51277710592_b3c918daee_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Rocks and Needles" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As you already saw in the photos - I picked a more relaxed outfit for running. I have usually ran in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">compression garments from Salomon</a> - which I still use - but it felt a bit <em>too much</em> for my current running routine. So I picked something which is a bit more toned down but still fun. I ended up ordering the <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/adidas-terrex-primeblue-trail-graphic-shorts-men-1378017_4027719.html">adidas terrex Primeblue Trail Graphic Shorts</a> and an <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/inov-8-organic-cotton-tee-obsessed-men-1317265_3804982.html">inov-8 Organic Cotton Tee</a>. The shorts are great - they are made from Parley Ocean Plastic - and not only because of their purple colour and material I really like them. They are comfortable, breathable and have two small zippered pockets in which I can store the phone, keys and some snacks. They are for me ideal running/ sports shorts as they have a relaxed cut and fit me perfectly, and they look less like I‚Äôm an Ultra-Runner and more like someone who enjoys running to stay fit.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51277711427/in/dateposted/" title="Vorne"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51277711427_3629f3fb7a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Vorne" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The shirt I am not that fond of - it‚Äôs simply too thick for my taste. I like the cool print on the back (if you follow me for a while you know that I like smart prints on my T-Shirts!) but I run too hot in this - it‚Äôs made from 100% Organic Cotton, which I like, but I prefer it in a thinner strength. As I often wear Patagonia Capilene Cool Shirts I might try one of these or a <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/patagonia-cap-cool-lightweight-lyhythihainen-paita-miehet-M666971.html?vgid=G1110392&amp;cgid=233239">Cap Cool Lightweight Shirt</a> instead. This inov-8 shirt is cool, but for me not a good choice for running.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51277710802/in/photostream/" title="Backside"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51277710802_27b3a35be5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Backside" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Which leaves the two <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/inov-8-running-wrag-1214121_3431361.html">inov-8 Running Wrags</a> I got. These basically are Buffs and I use them when running to keep my throat a bit better protected from the wind, if it‚Äôs really sunny as a headband and also to wipe the sweat away. I was surprised that there were two in the package but that means I always have one clean one waiting for my next run!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51278631213/in/dateposted/" title="Into the forest"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51278631213_35b4879b0a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Into the forest" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And that‚Äôs the new gear I got for trailrunning. I was tempted to also pick up a <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/inov-8-race-ultra-pro-5-juomareppu-M114960.html">Race Ultra Pro 5 Vest</a> but then it‚Äôs not really needed for my short runs at the moment üòÅ Overall I‚Äôm very satisfied with the kit (and also the fast delivery from addnature) and it has performed well on my short runs over the past weeks. It‚Äôs nice to go out running, and feeling better after it! If you still need a good reason to go (back) to running more regularly, maybe also treat yourself to some new <a href="https://www.addnature.fi/koe-vapaus-poluilla/?pmid=trail-running-freedom&amp;srule=newest-first&amp;page=1&amp;sz=48">running gear</a> and go outdoors! If you need some additional Motivation: With each run you build up more stamina and walking skills for hiking, so maybe simply few trailrunning as training for backpacking!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Trapped in my Social Media bubble, I ran less and less because I didn‚Äôt have the time to run an hour or four each day. Until I realized: Short 20 Minute runs are my way to happiness, and totally fine.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51113118243/in/dateposted/" title="Swans!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51113118243_26287676b9_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Swans!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>All photos in this article were taken with the iPhone 12 Pro Max.</em></p>

<p>In my Social Media bubble (so the people I follow and interact with) the average person runs a 5:30 min/ km Pace, runs almost every day of the week and usually runs for an hour or longer. That wasn‚Äôt me even at the best of times: I have a family and going out for a run every day for more than an hour is impossible - unless I want to get up at 5:00 o‚Äôclock in the morning to realize that, and that is not going to happen either. At the best of times - during holidays for example - I can manage to get out two to three times a week for 30 to 60 minutes of training, and that‚Äôs already a lot.</p>

<p>This had as a result that during a normal week I ran less and less. I was trapped in the thinking of ‚ÄúIf I can not go run for an hour I don‚Äôt need to bother at all‚Äù. And with two small kids, a partner I also want to spend time with, household work and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/skullsandpaints/">another hobby I really enjoy</a> finding 1,5 hours or more - because I need to change into my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">running clothes</a>, go run, come home, go to the shower and clean up my running kit - it‚Äôs not just ‚Äú<em>One hour of running</em>‚Äù - is in my current life situation impossible.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51113994765/in/dateposted/" title="Slow and happy"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51113994765_412ecee935_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Slow and happy" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But for me less running is also not good. Running is my stress-relief, a time where I don‚Äôt need to think about work stuff, doing the Taxes, articles to write, videos to edit and household work to do. I only concentrate on the trail in front of me, and where I should place my next step or two. I also can stop a moment and listen to the sounds of the forest, or observe the swan couple which has moved to the stream in our neighbourhood and smell the trees, moss and mud. But generally I simply enjoy running on the beautiful and varied single-track in the forest, and the exercise it gives me - because working from home means for me also that I don‚Äôt move as much as I‚Äôd like to.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51113995020/in/dateposted/" title="Swans"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51113995020_339eba4b58_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Swans" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51112643777/in/dateposted/" title="Frosty trails"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51112643777_be2aaf5827_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Frosty trails" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So a couple of weeks ago I decided ‚Äú<em>Whatever, I now go run for 20 Minutes</em>‚Äù and it has been a revelation, to say the least. Going running for 20 minutes gives me all of the above benefits - moving and exercising, getting my head free, enjoying the forest and nature - and including changing clothes and taking a shower afterwards I have a turn-around time of less than 40 minutes. That means I basically can set the <em>iltapalaa</em> (evening snack) for the kids on the table, change into my clothes, go run 20 minutes, take a shower and be back with them when they are finished, ready to go to sleep.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51113993970/in/dateposted/" title="Sweaty"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51113993970_09426b4ab0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Sweaty" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/51113209771/in/dateposted/" title="Leaving trails"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51113209771_79e51e17de_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Leaving trails" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And so I have been running every day since that revelation. Yes, ‚Äúonly‚Äù 20 minutes - a stark difference to 99% of my Social Media bubble - but I know that I don‚Äôt intend to run an Ultra Race or Marathon any time soon and these short runs are perfect for me. After all, I run for myself, and not for some Strava records or people I don‚Äôt know on Social Media. I run for me, my health, my mental well-being, and running just 20 minutes a day makes me happy!</p>

<p>And that‚Äôs what I want to pass on to you, too. If you haven‚Äôt been running or exercising because you don‚Äôt have the one or more hour it takes - because that‚Äôs what everyone else around you does - break out of that bubble, do what makes you happy for 20 minutes and then be double happy - happy that you were running/ exercising and happy that you were able to fit it inside of a busy day, which would have prevented you of doing it any longer! Trust me, doing what you want to do, even just for a short amount of time, is better than not doing the thing at all because you feel you can not dedicate an hour or more to it. We are doing this for fun, so it is better to do it just for a bit than not at all!</p>

<h2 id="gear-talk">Gear Talk</h2>

<p>I bought a couple of years ago some cold weather/ winter running kit from <a href="https://tidd.ly/3wOAjqJ">‚àû inov-8</a> so that I could continue running in the winter, which after all last some six months here in Vaasa, Finland. While it is ‚Äúspring‚Äù according to my calendar at the moment, when I go out run in the evenings it usually is around 0¬∞C so I am very happy for my toasty warm <a href="https://tidd.ly/2OHBBma">‚àû Winter Tight</a> in combination with their <a href="https://tidd.ly/3g6RFte">‚àû Base Elite Longsleeve</a> and a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/arcteryx-atom-sl-hoody-synthetic-jacket-bf/?pid=10239">‚àû Synthetic insulation Jacket</a> which keeps my torso warm. If it is really cold I also put on some <a href="https://tidd.ly/3dV5KHu">‚àû gloves</a> but usually these stay in my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/ultimate-direction-mountain-belt-hip-bag/?pid=10239">‚àû hip belt</a> where I also store my phone and water. On my head I have a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/buff-microfiber-reversible-hat-beanie/?pid=10239">‚àû Buff Beanie</a> which is really thin and which I usually wear under a helmet when I go skitouring, but it works well for running, too! I track my runs with the <a href="https://tidd.ly/3mGydoa">‚àû Suunto Spartan Ultra</a> which I use now since 5 or so years on all my trips and for training, and which is a superb smart watch. As I wrote in my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2021/03/all-the-shoes.html">All the Shoes</a> article a few weeks ago, I mix things up shoe-wise but for the last muddy weeks I only have used the <a href="https://tidd.ly/328zBX8">‚àû inov-8 Mudclaw G 260</a> and they have been performing great on the mud, snow and ice which currently is all over my trail. This kit has worked well for me now for three winters and gets a big üëç from me!</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I bought the <a href="https://www.lasportiva.com/en/crossover-20-gtx">La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX</a> in April 2018, and have used them since then pretty much on every backpacking trip: <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/microadventure-sipoonkorpi-national-park.html">Sipoonkorpi National Park</a>, at <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/09/camp-ousland.html">Camp Ousland</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/Zr6Ev1MFxBw">Backpacking in V√•l√•dalen</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/m8EstxnC8uQ">Backpacking in the Pyrenees</a> and also on my <a href="https://youtu.be/-AYVkZf61UE">backpacking trip in Hammastunturi Wilderness</a>. Additionally, in winter I also use these shoes all the time, so they easily have seen over 360 days of use so far, and I estimate that I have hiked over 1.500 km in them.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>Shoes give you protection and grip on your hiking &amp; backpacking trips, and depending on the environment you are likely to pick different shoes: If I‚Äôm hiking in super-warm weather the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals OSO</a> are my pick, if I am in the mountains I usually opt for an <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2017/08/la-sportiva-tx2-review.html">approach shoe like the TX2</a>, and if I‚Äôm hiking in the autumn off-the-beaten track or expect wet and cold weather, then I put on the Crossover 2.0 GTX as they keep my feet drier and warmer than an unlined shoe.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Integrating a gaiter into a running shoe isn‚Äôt new, but La Sportiva has done an absolute amazing job with this shoe as it is durable in all aspects which matter to me.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48744150896/in/album-72157710871736122/" title="Hammastunturi Wilderness"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48744150896_7c8434f706_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hammastunturi Wilderness" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>I have used this shoe for almost two years in autumn, winter and spring, in the Pyrenees, Finnish swamps, on snow &amp; asphalt and forest trails and have never found anything wrong with them. They‚Äôre always comfortable for my feet with a good fit in the heel, and the toe box is wide enough to accommodate my toes. The zipper holds up AMAZINGLY well, and still functions flawless. Also the heel - commonly an area where you see the wear &amp; tear first - is still without any damage. And I have been hiking a lot off-trail with these shoes, though shrubbery and whatnot, and the upper + gaiter still look in great shape.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>One shoe weighs in at 358 g in Size 42 which makes the pair 716 g heavy.</p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.lasportiva.com/en/one-percent-for-the-planet">La Sportiva is a 1% For The Planet Member</a>, and they have a <a href="https://www.lasportiva.com/en/recycle-program">Recycle Program</a> for the waste resulting from their manufacturing process in Val di Fiemme. The company is <a href="https://www.lasportiva.com/en/environmental-care">ISO 14.001 certified</a> and all that and more you can read in their <a href="https://www.lasportiva.com/en/csr">Sustainability Report</a>. BUT how do you <em>‚Äúrecycle‚Äù</em> your La Sportiva shoes at the end of their life-cycle? In most countries shoes belong into the residual waste bin. Or if they still have some life left in them, you can drop them into a clothing recycling bin or donate them to a place which takes old clothes and shoes. You also can look for the shop or place which is part of the <a href="https://www.nike.com/sustainability">Reuse-A-Shoe program</a>, where they recycle your sneakers and transform them into Nike Grind material.</p>

<p>As always, this is the most important part of the whole article - get a cup of coffee and then read on.</p>

<p>First things first: This is a Gore-Tex shoe, but that does not mean that I always had dry feet in them. If it are good, clear trails and it‚Äôs raining - dry feet, <em>mucho awesome</em>. Hiking through shrubbery, overgrown paths and through grass heavy with dew or wet from the rain, expect to have wet feet in a few minutes. The inner material also holds on to wetness well, so once the shoes are wet they are wet till you‚Äôre drying them over a stove. The wet shoes are not really a problem if you have some good <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/02/wrightsock-review.html">Merino Wool Socks</a> on and have the <em>hiking in wet shoes is not a problem</em> mind set, but it‚Äôs something I need to mention. Gore-Tex or waterproofness in shoes in general only goes so far really, but for me the benefit of having dry &amp; warm feet in the rain, when the trail conditions are right, outweigh the downside of hiking in a wet Gore-Tex shoe that needs longer to dry. I have found that drying the shoes overnight next to a wood stove is possible, and also in the tent they do dry out a wee bit if the air is not really saturated with moisture.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49622385937/in/dateposted-public/" title="Drying in the sun"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49622385937_4b31f879fa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Drying in the sun" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49621605448/in/dateposted-public/" title="Drying the La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49621605448_048c0d04c6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Drying the La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The shoe has a 10 mm Drop which is usually more than I like, but it‚Äôs still acceptable for me and as I have used these shoes so much I have got used to it. I also don‚Äôt particularly like that La Sportiva has used in the inner construction a material which holds moisture so long, I wish they would have used something more meshy that dries super-fast. But as this shoe is intended for winter trailrunning I get why they have made the shoe warmer instead of more breathable. It being a ‚Äúwarm‚Äù shoe also means that it isn‚Äôt really suitable to really warm weather - for me the ideal temperature to use the shoe is between -5¬∞c and 15¬∞C. If it is more than 15¬∞C I get really warm and sweaty feet, on the other side of the thermometer it‚Äôs not a problem to take the shoes down to -15¬∞C and still have toasty feet.</p>

<p>Grip wise these shoes are absolutely fantastic. Wet rocks in the Pyrenees, boulder-hoping down a field of scree: No problem. Traversing wet swamps: No Problem. Hiking on forest trails with roots and stones: Ideal terrain. Snow: Hi there, I‚Äôm at home here. The Crossover has superb grip thanks to it profile and the La Sportiva FriXion AT Sole. On wet boulders I am more careful than with a Vibram Megagrip sole, but I haven‚Äôt slipped on wet rocks yet. Given how much I have used these shoes I also am super-happy with the durability of the soles, they still have a few longer backpacking trips in them.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743965103/in/album-72157710871736122/" title="Hammastunturi Wilderness"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743965103_54ef2c5fa5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hammastunturi Wilderness" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49621607523/in/dateposted-public/" title="La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX Sole"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49621607523_9dff1ecd9c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="La Sportiva Crossover 2.0 GTX Sole" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The integrated gaiter of the Crossover 2.0 is what gives this shoe a great advantage over normal trailrunning shoes in my opinions - the zipper is really well designed, the gaiter can be adjusted in width (tightness) at the top so it doesn‚Äôt slip down, and the material keeps rain, snow and debris like dirt and small stones out of your shoe. It also gives the shoe a great look, and I wear the shoe with the laces always done and only slip in and close the gaiter, ready to go.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I know that this shoe is made for trailrunning in winter, which is why it is made warmer. I‚Äôd like to see the same shoe - maybe with a Vibram Megagrip sole for even better grip on wet rocks - with a lighter inside construction which dries faster when it is wet, and I also can imagine it‚Äôd be good to decrease the Drop to 6 mm or less. This is more wishing La Sportiva building the ideal hiking shoe for wet weather, though üòÉ</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I have hiked for 9+ years in unlined shoes as that‚Äôs the Ultralight Backpacking Mantra. Light shoes without a (waterproof) liner are lighter and dry faster when wet. That is true, with the caveat that it depends on the material of the shoes how quickly they will dry. But I got so frustrated year after year that I had wet feet as soon as it rained a tiny wee bit or I went slightly off-trail, that I decided I want some more protection from water - hence I bought these shoes. I don‚Äôt look back at all. I love these shoes and will purchase a 2nd pair once these are nearing the end of their lifecycle, for me they really are a fantastic pair of shoes which helps me to keep my feet dry longer, with great grip on all the terrain I backpack in, and I really love the integrated gaiter of the shoe.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you want to spend an active week of holidays in Scandinavia, √Öre is the place to go: Kayaking, trailrunning, hiking, kite surfing and downhill biking are just some of the activities you can do in this wonderful little village in Western Sweden. In the autumn the village is especially pretty, as the hills with their bilberry shrubs turn red and the birches add their golden leafs for that wonderful relaxing autumn feel!</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-re-sweden">Getting to √Öre, Sweden</h2>

<p>As sustainability grows more and more important to me I find it harder and harder to book a flight. While you can fly to √Öre I have a <a href="https://www.wasaline.com">ferry</a> in my town, that allows me to be very quickly in Ume√•, Sweden. From there I can hop on a <a href="https://www.sj.se">train</a> and be in six hours in √Öre, arriving right in the centre of the village. This is a very affordable and relaxing way to travel for me, as I can watch my favourite Youtube channels, read books, plot down ideas for articles and of course study the map for my upcoming backpacking trip in V√•l√•dalen! From Finland you can also leave from Helsinki and Turku with the <a href="https://www.tallinksilja.fi">ferry to Stockholm</a>, and then take the sleeper train to √Öre - allowing you to arrive well-rested in the morning and start your day in the active outdoor capital of Sweden!</p>

<h2 id="learning-downhill-biking-at-scandinavias-largest-bike-park">Learning Downhill Biking at Scandinavia‚Äôs largest Bike Park</h2>

<p>‚Äú<em>Are you Hendrik?</em>‚Äù my Guide Jesper asked me when I entered the Skistar Shop on the Main-square of √Öre. ‚ÄúYes, and I‚Äôm here to learn downhill biking. And I‚Äôm afraid.‚Äù ‚Äú<em>That‚Äôs good!</em>‚Äù Jesper replied, and from then on I knew I was in good hands. Odin helped me get dressed in my ‚Äúfull-body harness‚Äù as I referred to it, a combination of a chest and back protector, hand and elbow protectors, shin and knee protectors and of course a helmet and googles. ‚Äú<em>Have you ever sat on a Full-Suspension Bike?</em>‚Äù Jesper asked me when I was dressed. ‚ÄúNo‚Äù I replied. ‚Äú<em>No Problem, I‚Äôll teach you everything there is to know about Downhill biking, from braking, getting up the mountain with the lift and safely getting down!</em>‚Äù</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/45002158152/in/dateposted/" title="Downhill Bikes are fun!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1966/45002158152_acf8fcdc3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Downhill Bikes are fun!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äú<em>Have you ever sat on a Full-Suspension Bike?</em>‚Äù Jesper asked me when I was dressed. ‚ÄúNo‚Äù I replied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After I got my full-suspension bike we headed out and up towards the lift, where we stopped on a flat space and Jesper gave me the instructions I needed to get down the mountain, from the position of my feet (parallel to the ground), how to brake (with both brakes at the same time) and where to look while riding (as far ahead as possible). Then I needed to demonstrate what I was just told, and after a couple of circles Jesper decided I was ready to hit the tracks. A short instruction on how to put the bike into the chair lift followed, though attentive staff also was on hand and ready to help in case I‚Äôd mess up (I didn‚Äôt üòä).</p>

<p>On the top of the hill it was just as easy to get the bike out and walk away, and then we were ready to drop in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still afraid‚Äù I mentioned to Jesper, upon seeing the tracks and how &amp; with what speed other bikers where racing them down. ‚Äú<em>You‚Äôll be fine. We take this slow, just brake a little all the time and you‚Äôll just do what we talked about earlier.</em>‚Äù Jesper calmed me down, and to make it a wee bit easier we also skipped the first part of the track on this first run, and went in a wee bit further down the hill.</p>

<p>Well, it went really just as fine as Jesper said. Maybe my experience of riding bike every day, bikepacking and riding on local trails had given me a good foundation and idea on how to ride downhill, but soon I was whooping as I took a curve high and fast or racing over the narrow trails. Yes, I was braking and definitely not as fast and good as many others riding in <a href="https://aresweden.com/en/are-bike-park/">√Öre Bike Park</a>, but damn did it feel good to turn that fear into confidence, joy and hollers as I was riding down √Öreskutan!</p>

<p>That first day we were two and half hours out in the Bike Park, and I not only got to see the best view over √Öre, but I also got to ride many different trails - from the Beginner-friendly Serpentinen to the gorgeously scenic Organic. I really was overjoyed about the experience, and even if I didn‚Äôt master the jumps very well (taking off to early, with too much speed or not landing right) it was an amazing afternoon!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31177203358/in/dateposted/" title="Taking the curve"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1970/31177203358_6a4b0d156e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Taking the curve" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The next day - because all good things come in pairs! - I headed back in the morning to the Ski Star Shop, and with some luck &amp; good timing Jesper and me were the first people on the lift up. There‚Äôs several chair lifts which bring bikers up the mountain, as well as the cable car, though sadly it was too windy and so the latter was grounded. That meant we wouldn‚Äôt be able to ride from the top as Jesper had planned, but he had some great trails for me to ride nevertheless. I asked if it‚Äôd be OK to ride down Serpentinen again as the first ride, so I can ‚Äú<em>get back into the groove on familiar terrain</em>‚Äù and that was just what Jesper had planned.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31177213698/in/dateposted/" title="√Öre Bike Park and √Öresj√∂n"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1970/31177213698_ecf52e3eb1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="√Öre Bike Park and √Öresj√∂n" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then we took another lift up, rode to the other side of the mountain and enjoyed another scenic trail which brought us back down to √Öre. Back up Jesper decided I was ready to ride Shimano, √Öre‚Äôs most famous red trail. Shortly my fear flickered back up, but with some confidence inspiring words from Jesper I dropped in. Shimano has some 50 or so jumps (and I rolled over at least 40 or so of them üò¨ü§£) and 20 fat bank curves where you almost ride parallel to the ground, and it‚Äôs a trail which had me hollering quite a bit when I mastered a curve or a jump! After Shimano we had a small Fika in town, and then hit the trails a few more times before it was time for me drop off my gear and bike, say many thank yous to Jesper and leave the shop with a big, fat smile!</p>

<p>Downhill biking thus. It is strangely relaxing to ride down that narrow trail, always looking far ahead, not going too slow so you can take that curve as high as possible, and also trying to taking in that amazing scenery. You life in the present, things which you had on your mind while walking to the lift - remember that fear from the beginning? - are pushed aside, to be pondered about at another time, if ever again. The focus is on the trail in front of you, and when you arrive down at the lift station - a big smile and the excitement of that adrenaline rush leaving your brain. It‚Äôs addicting, and after years of wondering what people find in this ‚Äúdangerous sport‚Äù, I know: Focus, relaxation and joy.</p>

<p>(<em>And while I feel that I already have enough hobbies, I think I need to etch out some time to go more downhill biking. And maybe I need to visit the <a href="http://arebikefestival.com">√Öre Bike Festival</a> in 2019!</em>)</p>

<h2 id="trailrunning-to-totthummeln">Trailrunning to Totthummeln</h2>

<p>Since the summer I am <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/08/my-trailrunning-gear.html">trailrunning</a> several times a week at home. Now, as some of you know, I life at the coast in Finland. Unlike, for example, the Norwegian coast, the Finnish coast is pretty similar to the Dutch coast. Which means it‚Äôs prettttttty flat over here. And while I run up and down several ‚Äúhills‚Äù every week, these 15, 20 m of elevation did not really make me ready to run in the mountains. That‚Äôs the realization I came to when I was running with Bj√∂rn up to Totthummeln, a scenic hill with a great view which lays between √Öre and Bj√∂rnen. We started from Granen, the Hotel I stayed at, and after a few hundred meters of asphalt we soon hit the Trollstigen Trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44138672535/in/dateposted/" title="Trailrunning on Totthummeln"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1909/44138672535_55bcb74c1a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Trailrunning on Totthummeln" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>From then on it were sweet trails that took us around the mountain, with great views over √Öre, the lake and Bj√∂rnen, and then up to the top of Totthummeln. Bj√∂rn‚Äôs personal best time around the mountain is 35 minutes, though with my help and the visit to the summit we made it in double the time back to my Hotel‚Ä¶ Nevertheless, it was a great run, despite the rain, and if you don‚Äôt want to run to this easy summit - you always can make it a nice day hike with the family &amp; kids!</p>

<h2 id="hiking-on-reskutan">Hiking on √Öreskutan</h2>

<p>Before trailrunning with Bj√∂rn I was out on my own in the morning, exploring the hiking trails of √Öreskutan. There are over half a dozen trails which go up, around and across the mountain, and if you‚Äôre looking for a fun day hike - √Öreskutan will not disappoint. Yes, you will cross the ski slopes once in a while, but most of the time you‚Äôll be hiking in pretty forests on nice trails. There‚Äôs Caf√©s where you can enjoy a warm cup of coffee and a Kanelbullar, and if you don‚Äôt want to hike down you always can take one of the lifts back to the village. If the weather is good I can imagine that the hiking is very nice, and especially the Trollstigen Trail with it‚Äôs hidden treasures and wood nymphs is great for kids (it‚Äôs also only about a kilometre long, so also doable for 3 year olds!).</p>

<h2 id="exploring-the-village">Exploring the village</h2>

<p>After all that hiking, running and cycling I was hungry. Already before I left to √Öre I heard about the <a href="http://www.creperielogi.se/are/">√Öre Cr√™perie &amp; logi</a>, and the place did not disappoint! It was very cozy with super-friendly staff, and the Vegan Cr√™pes were amazing &amp; soooooo tasty. I also went and had coffee at the <a href="http://arekafferosteri.se/">√Öre Kafferosteri</a> which roast their own coffee - definitely a recommndation. As a Houdini Friend I also of course had to check out the <a href="https://houdinisportswear.com/se/vara-butiker?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzMDAhcXn3QIV7p3tCh2bEAokEAAYASAAEgK1s_D_BwE">Houdini Store √Öre</a>, though I also went to see the Shops of Peak Performance (which was founded in √Öre in 1986!), Stellar Equipment and Hagl√∂fs! Besides these stores you‚Äôll find a couple other sports stores, and plenty of Caf√©s and Bars to spend the afternoons and evenings.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-stay">Where to stay</h2>

<p>There‚Äôs over <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=-2468311&amp;aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">30 Hotels and B&amp;Bs in √Öre</a>, so there‚Äôs something for each wallet. I stayed my first two nights at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/se/hotell-granen.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Hotell Granen</a> which is a wee bit up the hill and offered a scenic view. The Hotel had an amazing breakfast, was super-beautifully decorated (I would have wished I‚Äôd had more time to just lounge in the comfy chairs by the fire place and read or drink a ü•É in the bar) and not even three minutes on foot and one was in the centre of √Öre!</p>

<p>My last night in √Öre I slept and dined at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/se/holiday-club-are.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Holiday Club √Öre</a> which was equally impressive. This is a Holiday Club Hotel unlike any other I have seen - it‚Äôs modern, stylish and in the middle of town -  you get to the railway station via a bridge! The Holiday Club √Öre has a Spa and Swimming Pool, and also is a popular Lunch place for the locals. I had twice a very delicious lunch here, and the Vegan 3-Course dinner was outstanding and so much that I couldn‚Äôt even finish my dessert! The room was very nice, I was sitting on the terrace in the sun and enjoying the view over the lake and town and a bit sad I had to leave so soon again.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping it up</h2>

<p>A holiday in √Öre can be many things: Exciting, relaxing, and tasty. I so much enjoyed my days in this small ski town, which unlike many other ski towns in the Alps or Northern Europe is open year-round. That‚Äôs right - √Öre‚Äôs shops &amp; hotels are open almost the whole year, and the <a href="https://www.skistar.com/en/ski-destinations/are/">cable cars and lifts</a> run in the winter, spring, summer and autumn: In the winter they bring skiers and snowboarders up the slopes, while from spring till autumn it are hikers and downhill bikers who take a ride up to √Öreskutan. Add in its proximity to several beautiful nature places like V√•l√•dalen and just a short trip to Norway, and like me, you probably soon will fall in love with the authentic vibe of this small town &amp; its friendly people and you‚Äôll wonder: When can I come back?</p>

<p><em>PS: √Öre hosts the <a href="http://are2019.com">FIS Alpine World Ski Championships</a> in February 2019, if you‚Äôre interested in these kind of things - check out the linked website and <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=-2468311&amp;aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">book a room right away</a></em>!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ask a Swede about √Öre and they will know: This is the place to be in the summer for Downhill biking, hiking, kayaking and many more outdoor activities, while in the winter this small village with it‚Äôs cozy Caf√©s, outdoor shops and restaurants becomes a bit bigger as people come to ski on √Öreskutan and the surrounding mountains. I spent the last week in √Öre and V√•l√•dalen enjoying the Swedish nature &amp; hospitality - here is what you can expect!</p>

<p>On my first day in √Öre I went hiking, trailrunning and explored the little village. Even in the off-season that is now there were plenty of people out on the mountain and in the village, and after some rain throughout the day it cleared up and became a nice evening with a spectacular sunset.</p>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/06/the-ul-fellowship.html">Eight years ago I have been in V√•l√•dalen</a> (<em>and go read that article it‚Äôs still AMAZING!</em>) and I was excited to go back. Heck, to be honest, I want to go back there right now. The autumn colours were on point, the bilberries sweet and big, and the scenery just sublime. A detailed article only about the backpacking trip comes soon so stay tuned for that, too.</p>

<p>After 92 amazing kilometres of backpacking it was back to √Öre and doing something which I have never done before: Downhill Mountain Biking. A sport I had &amp; still have a massive amount respect for, and was scared of. But with my Guide Jesper I became confident and had so much fun ripping down the trails, taking these high turns, learning to jump (still learning üòÇ) and feeling confident on these narrow trails. Wow, that was soooo good.</p>
