    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of 2016 I announced my intention of having a #NoGearYear - not taking in any new outdoor gear &amp; equipment, either buying it or getting it for free. Here’s the low-down on how that went.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/34692167335/in/dateposted/" title="Checking out the impassable Kesch Step"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4155/34692167335_452e9e5b90_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Checking out the impassable Kesch Step" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My intentions were simple for 2016: <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/01/zero-gear-year.html">No New Outdoor Gear</a>. I have enough of everything, from stoves over backpacks, quilts, shelters to shoes and apparel. And so I informed my partners that this gear nerd here is trying not to test &amp; use the <em>latest and greatest</em> but stick to my tried and used equipment. The months slipped by, I visited the ISPO without taking any of the free kit offered home, went on a lot of fantastic skiing trips, until <strong>BANG</strong> the post man stumbled into my house on a sunny April afternoon. While we knew each other well and he had no problems finding me in the prior years, he now asked me questioningly <em>“Hendrik Morkel?”</em>. I was just as surprised as him, as I hadn’t ordered anything. I took the parcel inside, worried about my #NoGearYear and opened it. It was a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/therm-a-rest-evolite-plus-isomatte/?pid=10239">Therm-A-Rest Evolite Plus</a> which I had inquired about in the autumn of 2015.</p>

<p>I was bummed. Does this mean I ruined my #NoGearYear? I put the pad into a corner so I didn’t needed to see it anymore and carried on like it nothing happened. Went skiing, cycling and backpacking - without that pad. But even trying to not use it it meant I had a new piece of kit in the house, a fact I couldn’t make go away even if I ignored the offender. May and June passed without visits from the post man, and then I was off to the OutDoor in Friedrichshafen. There I met Graham from <a href="http://www.cilogear.com">CiloGear</a> who told me he had a present for me. He must have seen the shock on my face as he quickly added <em>“No worries, I know about your #NoGearYear, this is just something I want to loan you!”</em>. Ah, that was better. Graham went on to explain me the prototype backpack which has ascended with its former bearer the Eiger Northface twice and established up a new route on a high mountain in Pakistan. It was a work of art and Graham’s passion for his design became evident - it reminded me of the LAUFBURSCHE backpacks which are made with the same love &amp; attention to detail. After he ran me through the bells &amp; whistles of the back he told me that he wants it back in 2017 when we meet again at the OutDoor (which is next month!). Such an arrangement worked well for me - it didn’t mean I owned a new piece of gear, but only loaned it, and that was in line with the rules I set myself.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/32396336051/in/dateposted/" title="Staring off into the distance"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/443/32396336051_9d5ed3cd01_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Staring off into the distance" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Well, the next shock came some time in the late summer as the zipper of my beloved <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody</a> went broken. It was still several months till the year would turn, and so I was looking into getting the zipper fixed. Alas, in the end I just wore the broken jacket as sending the jacket to the USA to get the zipper fixed seemed just like too much hassle. So I was wearing it as long as possible, and then now in 2017 I got a new one (finally a Size S!).</p>

<p>But that pad from April - it wasn’t my only lapse, I’m sorry to admit. In the autumn two companies I really like got in touch and asked if we could work together, long-term. I was pondering between a <em>“Lets get back in January”</em> and a <em>“Lets do this!”</em> and in the end I decided that this possibility was worth pursuing, even if I had a #NoGearYear going on. After all, I felt, my goal of not buying/ taking any gear was going well, and so I told them that I’d be delighted to work with them, and thus far it has been a really good partnership. I also received a brand-new quilt which I helped test &amp; design - with some luck you’ll read about this one later this week - and tested a new headlamp from another long-term partner, so all in all I probably had about a dozen of items arrive in 2016.</p>

<h2 id="the-aftermath">The Aftermath</h2>

<p>As you see, practically I failed my #NoGearYear. Theoretically, however, I feel I won. In 2016 I gave up the two gear editor jobs I was doing which means I now can use the gear I really want to use and do not need to test different kit all the time. Another positive side effect is also that less stuff arrives here (less than ten parcels have arrived here this year!) and I can continue with less hassle to apply the KonMari principle to the stuff I own (Read <a href="http://amzn.to/2pQcqwj">The Life‑Changing Magic of Tidying Up</a> and make your life better!). I also started to charge for gear reviews on the blog if a company or PR Agency inquires if I’d like to test something or just say “No thanks”. I also was and am more outdoors, on more trips (even if you don’t read about them here yet - my other company is keeping me very busy, sorry) and spend more time with my family. So all in all this #NoGearYear has been a very positive experience for me, and I can only encourage everyone to try it, too - even if you might fail it, it should be a good opportunity to get less stuff you don’t really need and save money for trips you really want to go on!</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Sometime last autumn I purchased a new domain. My mind is set, I need a fresh start. After eight years of blogging at Hiking in Finland I need a new challenge. It’s a bad time to do this, but if I don’t do it not now I never might. Hiking in Finland is the most-read English-language blog from Scandinavia, there’s over 30.000 Regular Readers a month, add in the close to 20.000 Followers and Fans on the different Social Media channels and you can understand the dilemma of changing something that’s so successful and generates part of my income (Yes, I work full time on the blog since 2014).</p>

<p>Things that led to this is that I do far more nowadays than hiking in Finland - just last year I was ski-touring in Norway &amp; Switzerland, on adventure travel trips in Macedonia, Greece and Mexico, on active family holidays in Vorarlberg, backpacking in South Tyrol and cycle touring in Finland. So the name is out-dated and limits me, but I also moved away a bit from what this blog was about in the beginning - ultralight backpacking. While I maintain that Ultralight is Not Dead I also have started to look over the borders - I have entered a partnership with Helsport for example, and while I always try to carry as little as possible and use the lightest gear for the occasion it’s not the be all and end all of all things like it was more in the past.</p>

<p>But mostly I feel I have become complacent. The status quo is a dangerous place to get lazy and before other’s think <em>It’s the same old</em> I myself might just kill the status quo, reinvent and embark on a new journey. It might be rough on the edges at the beginning, some of you might not like it, but I am sure that with a new challenge I am able to grow myself and the blog to a new level that’s more creative &amp; honest.</p>

<h2 id="design-or-why-does-hif-look-not-like-it-used-to">DESIGN or why does HiF look not like it used to?</h2>
<p>Last November I managed to destroy the backend of Hiking in Finland - right before the #HiFAdventCalendar should have started and while I was in Mexico. Some bacteria or virus knocked me out for two weeks once I returned from Mexico and I barely was able to publish the daily doors on the ad-hoc blog I created. As I got healthy again I had a big hacking session and managed to get HiF back online the way you see it now - still not really how it used to look like or how I would like it to look, but better than a 404. During February and March I will try to update the layout and looks, but first there’s some other priorities.</p>

<h2 id="yeps-theres-gonna-be-a-new-blog">Yeps, there’s gonna be a new blog</h2>
<p>Hiking in Finland will continue &amp; will be regularly updated in the future, but my new website Hike Climb Travel will see a lot more action. Hike Climb Travel is much broader in name as Hiking in Finland and reflects that I do much more than hiking &amp; backpacking in Finland. Hiking in Finland will be home to my adventures at home and neighbouring countries, while Hike Climb Travel will be my outlet for everything that does take place outside of my beautiful home country. It will kick off some time in February, with a pretty, responsive layout, a great brand identity and some great stories to get you hooked. The best way to stay informed about when the new blog goes online is to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.us2.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=b29c2acd04d959eace48da780&amp;id=46b5d0326f">subscribe to the Newsletter</a> and follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hendrikmorkel">Youtube</a>, but no worries, I also will let it be known here.</p>

<p>For some time I will try to work on both blogs, but time will show if that is possible &amp; smart or if I just move everything over to the new website. Thus, if there’s a favourite article here on the Olde Blog, now is a good time to save it as a pdf for future references. Some content will will also be moved over, so no worries that it’s gonna be all lost down the aether.</p>

<h2 id="twir-is-not-dead">TWIR is (Not?) Dead</h2>
<p>A couple of weeks back I asked on Instagram and Facebook for one reason why you follow me and a large part of the answers included TWIR. But a lot has changed since I started The Week In Review six years ago: I got married, have two wonderful kids and a house that still needs a wee bit of renovation (not to mention the garden). I feel I have neglected my family the last years every Sunday for several hours while writing the TWIR, and with a little daughter of one year I (maybe too late) realised it is time to kill The Week in Review, reclaim my Sundays and spend them with the people that matter the most to me - my wife and kids.</p>

<p>Also, The Week In Review is a popular post but it never generated much of income for me. I tried to monetise it in some tasteful ways by affiliate links to offers that matter to you, and a couple of times the Packrafting Store sponsored an issue, but these were not putting enough €$£ into my pocket for the time I invest into the TWIR. Because I know that so many of you love the TWIR and rely on it to find new, relevant content that matters, I am open to suggestions on how we could keep the Week In Review alive - but it would be published then on Mondays as I want to have a weekend. Maybe a PayPal subscription would be an option, but that would mean some of you would need to start to pay for the TWIR content. If you think that’s something you’d be willing to do, leave a comment underneath - and also other ideas and feedback is welcome.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31674881554/in/dateposted/" title="Ice River floating"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/700/31674881554_9d690dd7bb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ice River floating" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>All in all I am very happy to have this off my chest. I felt bad leaving you loyal readers in the dark about this since last December, but now that I typed it down and re-read it a couple of times it feels good and I am happy to hit publish and see how you take these changes. Thus, comment away - here or on the Social Media channels you can find me on!</p>

<p>Things have changed quite a bit in the time I have run this blog: When I started off with outdoor blogging people would usually not show themselves in their articles *¹ - at most a photo of oneself staring off into the distance. Maybe I was naive, young, or both, but back then I didn’t have a problem with showing myself (something that possibly has changed a bit in the last years as I have a family now and am more private). Nowadays, however, Selfies are an accepted form of portraying oneself, nowhere as ubiquitous as on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">Instagram</a>.</p>

<p>What is also ubiquitous on Instagram are these “<em>epic</em>” shots where a tiny person stars of into what looks like the wilderness. Here’s one of these:</p>

<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-version="7" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"> <div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"> <div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div><p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BHAgSC6vhs9/" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">A photo posted by Hendrik Morkel (@hendrikm)</a> on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2016-06-23T18:58:05+00:00">Jun 23, 2016 at 11:58am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote>

<p><br /> Personally I really am not a big fan of them, although I do see their appeal. My main problem is usually that it is always the same places that get these shots, and what is portrayed as epic wilderness or <em>“off-the-beaten-track”</em> are in truth places where you park your car 5 minutes away and then walk on a wide path to the spot. Add in a sunrise, sunset or a headlamp &amp; the Milky Way, do some Photoshop Magic and you have the standard Instagram photo which will attract thousands of likes. Why? Well, because people have seen that image, or a minor variation of it, already hundreds of times, and what is familiar is easy to like.
<br />
<br />But this article isn’t supposed to be on the failings of Instagram photography and my dislike of it, but the power of gear photos. It’s something I have been pondering over the last months, as I occasionally also post the tiny-person-in-big-environment-photo, and while they get a lot of engagement, it are the photos of gear - tents, backpacks, stoves, even a pair of shoes - that get even more engagement. It might be that my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/">Facebook Fans</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter Followers</a> are just as big gear nerds as me, or it might be something else.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9763145235/in/album-72157635543361552/" title="Mountain Laurel Designs TrailStar"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/4/3700/9763145235_51b887b518_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Mountain Laurel Designs TrailStar" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That something else it is what I’d like to ponder about (because we all know that we are gear nerds ;). I think that these, lets call them in contrast to the <em>tiny-person-in-big-environment-photos</em>, great-gear-in-an-epic-environment-photos, are so popular, because a photo of a tent in a beautiful spot, the stove that’s just set up to prepare dinner or the shoes hiking on a trail allow the viewer to put oneself literally in those shoes, behind that stove and in that tent. Sure, one could imagine that that’s you who looks of into the distance high in the mountains, but somewhere inside you know you haven’t been there. But that piece of equipment there - you might own that tent or stove - allows the viewer to put him- or herself there. You can imagine how pretty it would be to lay in that tent and stare into the sunrise in the morning, or sit behind that stove, ready to put the water on so that dinner can be served in a wee bit.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193489569/in/album-72157644166894052/" title="Dinner in the making"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5568/14193489569_090587cee9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Dinner in the making" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At least that are my thoughts why these gear photos are more popular than photos of a friend skiing down a fine line, starring up that impressive mountain face or hiking on a cool path. That person shown there, the viewer knows, isn’t her, but in that tent there, that could be where he’d like to go to bed. And with that comes maybe also the idea that it’d be nice to own that pair of shoes, that pack, tent, quilt or stove - because one could use it right there, and have with some luck of the weather fairy, the same great experience than the photographer of that gear photo.</p>

<p>This article waits since about four years in my drafts folder. Come November, December, it smiles at me. It says <em>“How about it, Hendrik? Should you take a one year break from getting new outdoor gear?”</em>. And I smile back at it, thinking <em>“You know, I’d love to. But I’m a gear editor at two magazines, so testing the latest and greatest is my job”</em>. And with that I put the thought ad actum, give this draft a new futuristic date, in the hope that the next year could be a <strong>No Gear Year</strong>.</p>

<p>Because honestly, I don’t need anything new. I have enough hardshells and trailrunning shoes, plenty of backpacks and shelters, as well as skis, climbing gear, a packraft and a Fatbike. Now I may be a gear editor at a climbing and at a backpacking magazine, but I’m sure there’s just as many normal outdoor enthusiasts out there who have cupboards full of gear. Much of it only getting used a handfull of times a year, with the owner eyeing the new version already while the one on the shelf is still perfect.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18493538621/in/dateposted/" title="Friday&#x27;s Outdoor Office"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/410/18493538621_e46dd8d195_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Friday&#x27;s Outdoor Office" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And who is to blame? Outdoor shops pretty much have a 20% off sale on a weekly basis, there’s winter, summer and Black Friday sales where shiny new kit is smiling at us at so deep prices - and lets be honest, we really needed that 10 g lighter rain jacket because it will make our skin-out weight significantly lighter. And that new 9.1 mm single rope was needed because it will help me to send my 7c project. That new, inflatable pillow surely will be the last pillow I ever need as I will sleep like at home on it, and those new trailrunners will make me hike faster and be great for training, too. And it was all on sale, too - how could I resist?</p>

<h2 id="money-spent-passionately-on-trips-not-gear">Money spent passionately on trips, not gear</h2>

<p>That lovely headline I copied some four years ago into this draft. As I was pondering last year to buy a new camera and spend a significant amount on it and lenses a friend commented <em>“Why not use what you have, take the money and go on a trip to shoot great photos?”</em>. <em>“Ah well”</em>, I said, <em>“you know, it is not that easy with a house and family”</em>. But the more I thought about it, the more it just seemed like one of those easy excuse phrases. Sure, it is more difficult to travel with a baby and a four-year-old - but it is not impossible as an increasing number of dads &amp; moms show when they go outdoors with their toddlers &amp; kids.</p>

<p>Spending money on gear is a lot easier than going somewhere, I get it. Browse your favourite outdoor shop, see that there’s something new and it’s for such a good price - click, click, click and another package will be arriving soon. Put it on or up in the garden, maybe snap a photo and you even would have material for a new blog post - if you’re a blogger, that is. But going on a trip?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t buy more than you need. Because if you do, you are going to consume way more than the resources of the planet can bear. - Rose Marcario, CEO Patagonia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that involves planing. Planing a route, the food, gear, getting there, having a look on the weather, etc. You also need to actually go outside, and what if it is -13°C and snowing like here right now? Well, that ain’t particularly pleasant, especially with all that grey sky which makes for less than ideal photo weather. But isn’t that actually what we have all the gear for? Down jackets, softshell pants, warm shoes - they’d be great for this weather, and as they haven’t been used yet (enough), why not take them out for a walk or even a Microadventure?</p>

<h2 id="join-me-in-a-year-without-new-gear">Join me in a year without new gear</h2>

<p>It’s nothing new. <a href="https://sweepingthegarden.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/no-new-gear-2012/">Craig has done it in 2012</a> and still loves to go outdoors. If a gear nerd like me whose job it is to test &amp; review the latest and greatest outdoor gear can do it, I’m sure you too, my esteemed reader, also can do 12 months without new gear. No new backpacking gear, no new bike, no new climbing gear, no new shoes, no new shelter - <strong>NO NEW GEAR</strong>. Personally I also include used gear in this, but that’s your call really. And twelve months are not that long - I just got used to write 2015 when noting down the date, and now it’s already 2016 - so a year without new gear will be faster over than you think.</p>

<p>And think about all the benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Next year, in 2017, you can splurge on the latest and greatest outdoor gear, which will most certainly be better than in 2016!</li>
  <li>In 2016 you can actually test and use all the gear you have already!</li>
  <li>You can go on more trips, because you’ll save hundreds of €£$ on not buying new equipment and sitting in front of the computer!</li>
</ul>

<p>Exceptions for me will be food and fuel, these I will purchase as needed for my trips - and you should, too. Because hiking &amp; climbing on an empty stomach is no fun!</p>

<h2 id="repair-re-use-swap-loan---and-use-what-you-already-have">Repair, re-use, swap, loan - and use what you already have</h2>

<p>In case a piece of equipment fails you - socks can get holes in the heels, shoes get walked through, a shelter starts to leak, the waterproof jacket ain’t waterproof no more - you can just fix it. Bring your shoes to the cobbler to get a new sole on them, wash your waterproofs to make them keep the snow &amp; rain out again, seam-seal your shelter and use the best repair tape of all time to fix everything else: Duct tape!</p>

<p>Still feel the urge to try something new in 2016? You can always loan gear - from friends, companies or websites - to try a new outdoor hobby, from packrafts over a SUP board to a Via ferrata set - there’s no need to own it if you just want to try it. Imagine you don’t like skiing after the first few tries, but you got skiing gear standing there for 2.000€? Loan before you own.</p>

<h2 id="get-out-adventuring">Get out adventuring!</h2>

<p>The bottomline for this move is for me two-fold: I want to Simplify my life further and show that one doesn’t need to chase the latest sale on gear. It’s more fun to go and chase the sunset with a light backpack on, which is what this pastime is all about: Spending time outdoors. Good outdoor gear helps, but we shouldn’t chase it more than spending time outside. So here’s to twelve months of no new gear, and more outdoor adventures!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>“Not another Gift Guide”</em>. I hear you. Here is the perfect gift for the hiker, climber, skier, cyclist and packrafter in your life.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8385427873" title="Self Portrait by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8361/8385427873_4c56d5300b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Self Portrait" /></a></p>

<p><em>“T’is the season!”</em>. Well, actually <em>“the season”</em> starts nowadays somewhere around September, when chocolate calendars and christmas decorations find their way into the supermarkets and the toys section doubles in size. <em>“Buy. Buy. Buy.”</em> it tells us everywhere. A couple of weeks later blogs and magazines will be full of Articles in the vein of <em>“The ultimate Gift Guide”</em>.</p>

<p>That’s why now is a good moment to reset the brain and engrain: <strong>You are not what you own.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7728232746" title="Taking in the view by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8289/7728232746_bb9a1e666c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Taking in the view" /></a></p>

<p>The hiker, climber, skier, cyclist and packrafter in your life needs just one thing this Christmas:</p>

<p><strong>Time</strong></p>

<p>Time is for our hobbies essential. A weekend away in the hills, a day at the crag, an afternoon ride or paddle - all of them need just one ting: Time. It’s our most precious resource, and it is scarily finite. Our lives are so full of things that it’s difficult for many to follow our passions, because between picking up the kids, grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning the house and other chores there’s often just too little time to pursue what we love to do. It’s the one thing you really can gift (or ask for) this Christmas: Time. It’s relatively cheap - likely free - and you can give the same gift to your partner.</p>

<p>There’s many advantages to this, not least for the environment. How long does happiness last when you get a gift? A few moments? A day? Compare that to a weekend backpacking or climbing, kayaking on the sea, a long cycling ride. That’s adventures, memories, which will last many, many years - maybe a lifetime even. Do you remember what you got last holidays? Might be hard to remember, right? How about the last weekend you were outdoors?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8701207971" title="Packrafting &amp; Camping by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8257/8701207971_7bdcd68cd4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting &amp; Camping" /></a></p>

<p>So instead of buying something material, ask for time. You have the gear and it’s just collecting dust in the closet because it so rarely gets used. You don’t need another piece-of-something, you need to have the time to go out and use what you already have. Take your time and go on a long backpacking weekend. Use it for working on your climbing project. Cycle to that hill outside of town which you see each day on your way to work and sleep on top of it that night.</p>

<p>I’ve asked for time the last few years, and it was always a memorable present. I went to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/ice-climbing-in-korouoma.html">Korouoma</a> the first weekend of this year with my time present and climbed Ruskeavirta, Finland’s highest ice waterfall. Last year I went to the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2013-experiences.html">Abisko Ice Climbing Festival</a>, skied &amp; ice climbed and saw beautiful Northern Lights. I’m already pondering what to do with my time present this year - go on a Microadventrue? Northwards to Lapland? Or maybe even Scotland? Anticipation is the greatest joy - after being outside, of course!</p>

<p>Get time to go outdoors.</p>
