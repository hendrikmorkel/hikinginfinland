<p>Travelling safely during the Covid-19 Pandemic is possible in Finland (with some caveats, more about these <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel/status/1361235118329913344">here</a>) and so my 9-year old son and me travelled to <a href="https://www.inarisaariselka.fi/en/">Saariselk√§</a> - long-time readers will remember my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2019/10/mountainbiking-in-lapland.html">autumn</a> trip there. Saariselk√§ is a tranquil little village with 300 inhabitants and lays at the gates of the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/urho-kekkonen-national-park.html">Urho Kekkonen National Park</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqEBC4yj3Faikt3HHS3jU8l3Fm8pxQvN3">Hammastunturi Wilderness</a>. It has a superb network of Fatbike and XC Skiing trails, a small but very good Ski Resort and plenty of other opportunities of enjoying the outdoors. As well as many great accommodation options, like the wonderful <a href="https://www.laplandhotels.com/EN/hotels-in-lapland/saariselka/lapland-hotels-riekonlinna.html">Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna</a> where we stayed.</p>

<p>We were exceptionally lucky with the weather - it was ‚òÄÔ∏è every day but bitterly cold, some days at low as a felt temperature of -32¬∞C - but even those temps were bearable with the <a href="https://youtu.be/E_ma70A6HkM">right clothes</a> and keeping active!</p>

<p>Behind me lay the solitude of the Hetta-Pallas Trail, in front of me was <a href="https://www.yllas.fi/en/home-page.html">Yll√§s</a> and √Ñk√§slompolo with it‚Äôs many different options of fun in the snow. My new friends dropped me off at the <a href="https://sevenfellshostel.com/en/7-fells-hostel-eng/">7 Fells Hostel</a>, where I moved my stuff into the cozy little cabin which was waiting for me. Outside the sun was setting, but that didn‚Äôt stop me from a short stroll to explore the surroundings a bit more. √Ñk√§slompolo is a compact and cozy village, probably one of the best Finnish winter villages as it is home to both the largest ski resort in Finland as well as a very extensive XC skiing network with over 400 km of Tracks. Add in superb possibilities for skitouring, Fatbiking and winter hiking, and you understand why this little village is so popular with winter lovers.</p>

<h2 id="fatbiking-in-ylls">Fatbiking in Yll√§s</h2>

<p>The next morning brought clear and sunny skies, and it was an easy decision to head back out into the cold again. Going outside makes my life better, it‚Äôs a way to disconnect for hours from Social Media and the internet, and to do something which I like a lot better than sitting in front of a screen: Being in nature, breathing fresh, cold air, feeling the sun and wind on my cheeks. I decided to go for a Fatbike ride, as I could loan a Fatbike from the friendly folks of the 7 Fells Hostel, and they have a really nice Fatbike Trail network in Yll√§s! I rode through the village, past the supermarket, Caf√©s and sports shops, towards the start of the trails.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802510028/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Riding"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802510028_f7dec84430_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Riding" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803257031/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Getting all the Infos"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803257031_d265ccc9be_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Getting all the Infos" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>It was a warm and sunny day, the temperature was +2¬∞C and it was perfect for riding the Fatbike. There were very few people around - this was just at the start of the first Lockdown of 2020 in Finland, and pretty much only locals were around, as well as a very few visitors. I decided to ride to the Kes√§nkij√§rvi Laavu - five years ago I went skitouring on Kes√§nki and I have really good memories of this fjell, and at least seeing it from the lake would make me happy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803257121/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Which way?"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803257121_26715d4e57_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Which way?" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803257446/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Handlebar."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803257446_ee278c4088_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Handlebar." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But that wasn‚Äôt the only thing which made me happy. Riding in this warm weather, in the sun, on empty Fatbike trails, through young birch forests, over swamps and always with the beautiful hills in view, also made me happy. Really happy üòä</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803257751/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="&lt;Mountain"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803257751_47899021f8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="&lt;Mountain" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803373287/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Palls-Yll√§stunturi National Park"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803373287_fe507071fd_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Palls-Yll√§stunturi National Park" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Soon I entered the Pallas-Yll√§stunturi National Park, where the trails became a bit more narrow, and I was hollering and smiling as I rode through the forest, past the lake shore and towards the wee Laavu at the end of the trail.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803373447/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Closed Laavu"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803373447_dbe1030b09_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Closed Laavu" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At the Kes√§nki Laavu a thin line of smoke was rising from the fire pit. A large yellow sign was hanging at the top of the Laavu, telling visitors in Finnish, Swedish and English that it was closed because of COVID-19. I had a small sip of water from my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/hydro-flask-standard-mouth-with-standard-flex-cap-isolierflasche/?pid=10239">‚àû bottle</a>, took a few bites from my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/clif-bar-clif-nut-butter-filled-chocolate-hazelnut-butter-energieriegel/?pid=10239">‚àû Nut Butter Clif Bar</a> and explored the surroundings. There‚Äôs a Caf√© across the XC Tracks - which also was closed - where there were two persons, who were, like me, enjoying the sun and silence.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802512608/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Closed Caf√©"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802512608_fe64e153f3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Closed Caf√©" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I was tempted to ride back over the lake, but thought better of it and came the same way - it was a good single track over all, and as it was warm and a yellow sign was warning me that the track over the lake was closed, I opted for the safe alternative. Longingly I watched back towards the hills, wishing I could go ski-touring on them in this grand weather‚Ä¶</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803259061/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Wee Hills"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803259061_c6f1f007ab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Wee Hills" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="skitouring-to-kuertunturi">Skitouring to Kuertunturi</h2>

<p>The next morning was already my last full day in √Ñk√§slompolo, and the weather was grey. Let me be honest: I slept in, had a long breakfast, was reading and at some point in the early afternoon decided I better make the best use of my time here in the snow of Lapland - back home there was no snow, after all. So I packed my gear, put on my <a href="https://tidd.ly/3nn9nIY">‚àû ski boots</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/pXmXznusheI">backpack</a> and skinned up Kuertunturi, which rises up just behind my Cabin at the 7 Fells Hostel. Half-way up I also shot a short video about dressing for ski-touring:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E_ma70A6HkM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Then my <a href="https://www.dpsskis.com/collections/men/products/wailer_a100_rp">skis</a> and <a href="https://tidd.ly/3pSa5zu">‚àû contour Hybrid skins</a> brought me further up the hill. OK, maybe my legs also had something to contribute‚Ä¶</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50803371057/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Skis"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50803371057_ee46c318d8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Skis" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802513378/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Top"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802513378_e81d700825_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Top" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At the top of this easy hill - there‚Äôs also a well-marked winter hiking trail going to the summit - I found good weather and amazing views. I had a clear view towards the closed Yll√§s ski resort, Kes√§nki and Lainiotunturi and the over 50 km distant Pallastunturi hills, which I skied across just a few days prior! It was an absolutely stunning scenery which lay around me, and if the sun wouldn‚Äôt have been setting already I probably would have stayed longer to enjoy my last evening in Lapland from the summit of a fjell.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802513783/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="Yll√§s Ski Resort"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802513783_e0f269062e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Yll√§s Ski Resort" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But as the sun was already setting, and my descent through the forest was in the shadow, I decided to head back down. I had some good turns, some ice, some fun moments and some pushing across a frozen swamp before I was back at my cabin, where a warm shower and a tasty <a href="https://tidd.ly/3rUiV1m">‚àû LYO Food meal</a> were waiting for me. As well as some packing, but at least that‚Äôs something which I have down pretty well!</p>

<h2 id="visiting-ylls">Visiting Yll√§s</h2>

<p>Your first stop should be the <a href="https://www.yllas.fi/en/news/corona-info">Yll√§s Corona Info Website</a> and the <a href="https://koronaturvallinenlappi.fi/en/home/">Coronavirus situation in Lapland</a> website, which inform you both about the hygiene concept in Yll√§s and the ski resort as well as the current COVID-19 situation in all of Lapland. Personally I would avoid the ‚Äúbusy‚Äù weeks and go when very few people are in Lapland, to minimize the risk of getting exposed and/ or putting a strain on the health care system. You yourself obviously should either have a negative PCR Test that is not older than three days or already received the vaccine. If that is all in order: Plan your trip!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/50802510513/in/album-72157717733849941/" title="My Cabin at the 7 Fells Hostel"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50802510513_47c2045f74_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="My Cabin at the 7 Fells Hostel" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I stayed at the very stylish &amp; cozy <a href="https://sevenfellshostel.com/en/7-fells-hostel-eng/">7 Fells Hostel</a> which I can highly recommend, and also the <a href="https://yllaslodge.com/en/">Lodge 67ÀöN</a> gets good reviews. There are more <a href="https://www.yllas.fi/en/accommodation.html">accommodation options in Yll√§s</a>, too, from Hotels to cabins in the woods. Yll√§s has a host of <a href="https://www.yllas.fi/en/services.html">services</a>, from eating out over rental gear to shopping for groceries, so you can find everything in the village in case you forgot something or want to try XC skiing or Fatbiking!</p>

<p>To the North and back South I travelled with <a href="https://www.onnibus.com/home">OnniBus</a>, <a href="https://www.matkahuolto.fi/en">local busses</a> and the <a href="https://www.vr.fi/en">train</a>, and while it is a long trip it is affordable, comfortable and takes less time than driving by car. If you have to get around in the village, there‚Äôs a ski bus and also taxis, so there really is no need for an own car.</p>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong> I think I spent again too few days in Yll√§s. I still haven‚Äôt skied in its ski resort, and would love to go on more skitouring trips on the surrounding hills. Also the amazing XC Tracks are really inviting, so a longer trip to this hidden pearl is in order! What about you - have you been to √Ñk√§slompolo and Yll√§s?

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/10983987276/" title="Winter"><img src="https://s2.yimg.com/sk/3789/10983987276_15b9ee5bc9_b.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Winter" /></a></p>

<p>Dear Winter,</p>

<p>I haven‚Äôt always been fond of you. As I arrived in 2002 in Finland you had the country in your icy grip, and spring couldn‚Äôt come early enough for me. Also in the next couple years, when you visited Jyv√§skyl√§ with -35¬∞C temperatures for weeks at a time, I didn‚Äôt find particular pleasure in you.</p>

<p>But I got wiser with age. I slowly started to enjoy your gifts, and took my snowboard and skis down the hills and tracks. I enjoyed walking my dog on frozen lakes, tried Nordic Tour skating, and had many laughs as I was tobogganing down steep hills with my sled. Warming up besides a warm fire with a hot Minttu kakao has become a sacred ritual, one that I carried over into summer after a long day on the trail.</p>

<p>The more time I spent outside between spring and autumn, the more I fell in love with what you had to offer. I realized that there‚Äôs no such thing as bad weather as long as one is <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/02/layering-guide-how-to-dress-for-winter.html">dressed well</a>. I became aware that you make possible things which spring, summer and autumn can‚Äôt: I am able to see the tracks of animals in the snow. On <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/01/backcountry-cross-country-skiing.html">skis</a> the going is fast and fun. I can build <a href="http://youtu.be/HHCZhUZXhZU">snowmens</a> with my son. Go <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/04/snow-wars-ultralighters-strike-back.html">winter hiking</a> with friends and swim in ice holes after a sauna. And lately I enjoy <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/02/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2014.html">climbing steep frozen ice</a>. I explored forests and hills on my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/01/video-msr-lightning-ascent-review.html">snowshoes</a>, and built snow caves.</p>

<p>But this year, you decided to not spend much time here. In early January I needed to drive 600 km north to find you. I climbed beautiful ice falls, camped on snow, and enjoyed the silence. Two weeks later you appeared here in the south and covered the land with snowflakes and the sea and lakes with ice. I took pleasure trailrunning on soft, snowy trails, climbing the local icefalls, and building a snowman with my son. It shouldn‚Äôt last. And that where I was pondering fatbikes and new <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/black-diamond-tourenski/?pid=81">skis</a>, to bring more fun and excitement to into the cold season.</p>

<p>A mere four weeks after you arrived, you are as good as gone again. I couldn‚Äôt even get the skis out for a round on the ice, let alone the local trails. Our snowman is nothing else than a sad little hill of hard-packed snow. Instead of bright, snow-lighted nights, darkness reigns again until the sun will stay up all the time. Your attempts at a comeback are half-hearted, and so I look back on memories of when you visited Finland and gave us lots of fun. May you come back in 2015 like this.</p>

<p>As for 2014, I hope that Eastern Tyrol, the Dolomites and the USA know to value your presence. I leave thee behind with the positiv prospect that the packrafting, backpacking, bouldering and rock climbing season this year will start a few months earlier as usually.</p>

Then this Dressing Guide will help you to create a warm, safe, comfortable and effective layering system for your winter outdoor activities.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12436803535/" title="Layering Teaser"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5479/12436803535_f397e7fa39_b.jpg" width="1024" height="398" alt="Layering Teaser 2" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Dressing in layers is not difficult.</strong> The most important thing with is that you need to learn to take off or put on a layer depending on how warm or cold you feel - it‚Äôs something one really needs to take care of, as often one does not want to stop to dress up/ down. But by doing so you either get very cold or very hot &amp; sweaty, both situations you can avoid by being determined to keep this simple guideline in mind: <em>When you‚Äôre running hot, take a layer off. When you‚Äôre running cold, put on a layer.</em> I actually like to be a tad on the cool side, this way I‚Äôm not over-heating. And once you‚Äôre familiar with this, you can slowly start to dress up/ down <em>before</em> you‚Äôre too hot/ cold.</p>

<p><strong>Hover over the photos to see a discriptions of the items in the photos!</strong></p>

<h2 id="base-layer">Base layer</h2>

<p>Task: <em>To wick away sweat and keep you warm &amp; dry.</em></p>

<p>My baselayer choice for skiing, hiking &amp; ice climbing is Merino wool. I value its qualities - non-smelly, warm when moist, comfortable on the skin - over other choices. The <a href="http://www.partioaitta.fi/tuotehaku/aclima">Aclima Woolnet</a> baselayers I have are superb and really some of the warmest &amp; lightest baselayers I have used. The two pieces - the long john and crew neck - work very well together. The top has a long back and reliably keeps the cold away - nothing is more annoying than tops with a short back, as just when you bent over to close your ski‚Äôs binding the wind will blow snow on your exposed back. These two garments are also durable, and six months of constant use - often being worn a week at a time - had thus far no effect on them.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489465133949517824/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489465133949517824;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>Alternatives: <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/02/gear-talk-woolpower-merino-awesomeness.html">Woolpower baselayers</a> are superb and I value their garments highly. I also have used <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2009/09/gear-talk-smartwool-microweight-zip-t-bottoms-initial-review.html">Smartwool baselayers</a> and liked them.</p>

<h2 id="mid-layer">Mid layer</h2>

<p>Task: <em>Transport sweat further away form the skin, add insulation and protect to some degree from the elements.</em></p>

<p>As simple as the base layer is, so versatile are the choices for the midlayer. This layer is by far the most depending on your own physique, metabolism, and what you‚Äôre doing outdoors. Lets start with the simple choices: A pants and midlayer top.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489465124558471168/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489465124558471168;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>I have been using the <a href="http://bit.ly/1iRkzXC">Outdoor Research Lodestar Pants</a> now for the second winter and really like them. Before that I wore shell pants, but in strong winds these were way too cold - the shell material would push directly against my thighs and thanks to the wonders of thermal conduction I would get very cold legs. The Lodestar Pants on the other hand has a wonderfully warm Powershield High Loft lining, that‚Äôs that fluffy fleece material which traps warmth and feels great on the skin. It‚Äôs a top-notch pants that I have been using for skiing, hiking, cycling and snow-shoeing, with ventilation zippers at the top, accessible pockets and removable suspenders. Most of all, the Polartec Powershield Pro shell keeps wind and to some extent moisture at bay, so those windy days of the past are no problem anymore. The second easy pick is the <a href="http://rab.uk.com/products/mens-clothing/baselayer/baseline-hoodie.html">Rab Baseline Hoody</a> (<a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/11/hoodylicious.html">Review here</a>). It‚Äôs warm, light and wicks sweat fantastically away.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489465141834809344/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489465141834809344;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>The above two are excellent choices for your average (-10¬∞C air temperature) winter day, but when you‚Äôre the cold type then an additional garment is nice for extra warmth. Enter the <a href="http://bit.ly/1eJMrhR">Woolpower 400 Vest</a>: A Merino wool vest of the same great material of the Woolpower baselayers. A vest, because that way your torso - the important area to keep warm, with all them organs there - stays nicely warm, while the usually not that warmth-needing arms aren‚Äôt over-insulated. Plus, it saves weight and you can cool down over the arms.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489465136717758464/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489465136717758464;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>However, if it‚Äôs really cold (anything lower than -20¬∞C air temperature) or you‚Äôre just the freezing type, a synthetic insulation layer like the <a href="http://bit.ly/1cp8TXG">Patagonia Nano Puff Hoody</a> over the Rab Baseline Hoody can add a tremendous amount of warmth. This is for me more of a belay/ short break jacket, but if it has been freezing cold it‚Äôs nice to wear a synthetic puffy as an additional midlayer to stay warm.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489465106309054464/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489465106309054464;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>The other side of the coin are people that run so warm, they often hike even in -15¬∞C only in their baselayer top. I‚Äôm certainly not that type, but when for example trailrunning in winter I wear the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/ortovox-andermatt-vest-blue-ocean-gr-s/?pid=81">ORTOVOX Andermatt Vest</a>. It‚Äôs a softshell/ merino-lined vest that keeps the wind away and the Merino wool lining helps to wick sweat further away from my skin. It is an ideal piece for XC skiing, too.</p>

<p>Alternatives: Dozens. See past <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">reviews</a> for ideas and this <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/magazin/black-diamond-dawn-patrol-pants-test/?pid=81">Black Diamond Dawn Patrol Touring Pants</a> review.</p>

<h2 id="shell-layer">Shell layer</h2>

<p>Task: <em>To keep the elements at bay.</em></p>

<p>The shell layer is nowadays also not as straight-forward anymore as it has been in the past - you have three choices for it: Windjacket, Softshell or Hardshell. For fast-paced activities - trailrunning and XC skiing, for example - a windjacket is a superb choice if it isn‚Äôt snowing. I have used the <a href="https://www.norrona.com/en-GB/Products/4326-12/3440/bitihorn-aero100-jacket-m/">Norrona bitihorn aero100 Jacket</a> for the last half year, and before that the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/09/rab-cirrus-wind-top.html">Rab Cirrus</a> and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/07/arc-teryx-squamish-hoody-first-look.html">Arc‚Äôteryx Squamish</a>. All three are great pieces for keeping the wind away and as you should already have a windjacket, you can further extend its usage and don‚Äôt need to buy an extra garment.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489476046127628288/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489476046127628288;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>If you‚Äôre more of the cold type, or quickly-running hot type, then you might want to try out a softshell. I have used a handful of softshell jackets for all sorts of outdoor shenanigans, and really like the fit &amp; functions of the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/mountain-equipment-trojan-hooded-jacke-nautilus-gr-s/?pid=81">Mountain Equipment Trojan Jacket</a>. This Windstopper softshell has a wonderful athletic cut and is extremely durable, and keeps snow and rain outside while being pretty breathable. I just wish it would not have Pitzips!</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489476051315982336/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489476051315982336;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>And then the wind picks up, it starts to snow, and you‚Äôre bushwacking through the forest. Time for a hardshell. I have used the <a href="http://www.outdoorline.sk/en/176-westcomb-switch-lt-hoody-jacket.html">Westcomb Switch LT Hoody</a> now for the second year, and do like this NeoShell jacket. It breathes well, keeps all the nasty weather away and lets you arrive dry at camp. A good hood, excellent Napoleon pockets and nice elastic Velcro cuffs make this a very good hardshell for your layering system. But again, it‚Äôd be perfect without Pitzips!</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489465138617778176/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489465138617778176;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>Alternatives: The <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/12/hagl-fs-ozo-pullover-review.html">Hagl√∂fs OZO</a> still features the best hood, ever. The <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/11/rab-demand-pull-on-review.html">Rab Demand Pull-On</a> and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2009/11/gear-talk-rab-momentum-jacket-drillium-pants.html">Rab Momentum Jacket</a> are excellent eVent garments, while the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/04/golite-tumalo-storm-jacket-pants.html">GoLite Tumalo Storm Jacket</a>, made of Pertex Shield, is also an alternative.</p>

<h2 id="insulation-layer">Insulation layer</h2>

<p>Task: <em>To add a lot of warmth when moving little &amp; being stationary.</em></p>

<p>You make a long break, have arrived at camp or the belay, and now will be moving very little and hence generate very little warmth. Time to put on the insulation layer. You can not beat down for the weight-to-warmth ratio, and as this piece will likely sit most of the time in your backpack while you‚Äôre skiing, hiking or snow-shoeing, a lightweight jacket is in my opinion preferable. The <a href="http://bit.ly/1lWAMzZ">Rab Infinity Down Jacket</a> has been with me for three seasons and has done a very good job. It‚Äôs light, warm, has a good hood and pockets, and thanks to the water-resistant and windproof shell material snow and wind are no problem for it. It also packs reasonably small, so is a great option for the weight- and space conscious.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489476030344462337/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489476030344462337;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>Alternatives: I love the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/11/kl-ttermusen-loke-review.html">Kl√§ttermusen Loke</a>, a superb down pullover. Also the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/04/sir-joseph-koteka-down-jacket.html">Sir Joseph Koteka Down Jacket</a> has kept me nice and warm in very cold weather.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>

<p>That‚Äôs it. As you saw (and see underneath again), dressing warm for winter is easy. To repeat:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Base layer - <em>To wick away sweat and keep you warm &amp; dry.</em></li>
  <li>Mid layer - <em>Transport sweat further away form the skin, add insulation and protect to some degree from the elements.</em></li>
  <li>Shell layer - <em>To keep the elements at bay.</em></li>
  <li>Insulation layer - <em>To add a lot of warmth when moving little &amp; being stationary.</em></li>
</ol>

<p>If you dress this way your next winter adventure should be warm, comfortable and safe. If you start from scratch with your layering system, a good baselayer and midlayer are the best 1st investments, while you can make use of the same shell layer you use in the warm seasons. A warm insulation layer is only really necessary if you‚Äôre doing long day trips where you will have breaks outside or spend the night outdoors - although in the mountains it is a recommended safety piece to have in case of sudden weather changes. You also can use a not that thick puffy jacket for starters, and see if it fulfils the role.</p>

<p>And remember: <em>When you‚Äôre running hot, take a layer off. When you‚Äôre running cold, put on a layer.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/winter-backpacking-basics/">Winter Backpacking Basics course</a> is a three days/ two nights course which is perfect to familiarise yourself with Nordic winter conditions and how to enjoy them in the outdoors with a rucksack on your back. Before we head out I discuss with you gear &amp; food planning so that you end up with the lightest and safest pack for the conditions ahead, give you information about the area and weather to be expected, and answer all questions you may have. Your safety, enjoyment and that you learn valuable winter skills is the highest priority, as well as having a good amount of fun!</p>

<p>On the trail you‚Äôll learn how to navigate in snowcovered forests, hike safely over frozen lakes, and identify the different animal tracks in the snow. At camp we practice to pitch your shelter in the snow, you will learn to make a nice warm fire, how to efficiently melt snow, and stay warm at night; amongst other things.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs two dates for this course this coming February, the first one is <strong>15.02.2013 - 17.02.2013 in Southern Finland</strong> (Pirkanmaa Region) and our mode of transportation will be snowshoes. The second date is <strong>22.02.2013 - 24.02.2013 in Northern Finland</strong> (Lapland) and we will use skis as a mode of transport. Both courses have six slots, though be quick to sign up as both courses already have reservations and the dates are approaching fast. <strong>Read more and enrol on the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/winter-backpacking-basics/">Winter Backpacking Basics course</a> page.</strong></p>

<p>The Winter Backpacking Immersion course is excellent for those with some winter backpacking experience (for example if you have done the WBB course =) and would like to spend a week in the snow. We will ski for a week through the forests and fjells of Lapland, will build a snowshelter and spend the night in it, and hopefully have plenty of starry nights with Northern Lights dancing above our heads! This course helps you to consolidate your winter skills, so that tasks like pitching your shelter on snow, making a fire and staying warm become second nature.</p>

<p>From the <strong>16.03. till the 23.03.2013</strong> we will head to the beautiful Urho Kekkonen National Park and ski for a week through it‚Äôs breathtaking landscape. This land, close to the Russian Border, is home to Wolverines, Lynx, Wolves and Bears, and we might see tracks from them in the snow. However, more likely we are to see Reindeer, Elks and Hares, while in the sky above us we might be able to spot a Golden Eagle. This will be a superb trip to strengthen your winter skills, and experience the beautiful nature of Lapland! <strong>Read more and enrol on the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/winter-backpacking-immersion/">Winter Backpacking Immersion course</a> page.</strong></p>
