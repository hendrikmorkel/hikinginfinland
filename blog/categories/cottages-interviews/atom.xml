<p>Almost ten years after I started the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/interviews/">Cottage Interview Series</a> they are back! I always really enjoyed conducting these interviews and getting to know the people behind the gear, and what drives them. Itâ€™s just - around eight years ago I slowly ran out of companies to interview ðŸ˜Š But during the last years more &amp; more new cottages came into existence, and many of them have a unique solution or design on how to make our bacpacking trips more fun - and lighter! Thus over the next several months I will be interviewing some of the newest Ultralight cottages across the globe to find out what drives them, but I also will be re-visiting some of the cottages I interviewed way back in the day and find out how they are doing in 2018!</p>

<p>If you are interested in what drives ultralight gear makers, what goes into designing and making an ultralight hammock, backpack, quilt or hoody - you will want to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/atom.xml">subscribe via RSS</a> to the blog or become a Fan &amp; Follower on <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/">Facebook</a> where I also will announce the new articles. Excited? Better be - the first interview will go up in two weeks!</p>
