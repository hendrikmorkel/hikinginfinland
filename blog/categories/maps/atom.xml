    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lets kick the new week off with something everyone knows and can relate to: Maps. More specifically: Awesome Maps. Awesome Maps for all your outdoor activities, from hiking and climbing to mountain biking and diving! Why? Because looking at a beautiful map in your home is second only to hiking with a map outdoors!</p>

<h2 id="awesome-maps">Awesome Maps!</h2>

<p>I have written about maps before (a loooong time ago <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/06/waterproof-hiking-maps.html">here</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/04/planning-a-trip-in-the-lake-district.html">here</a>). I ‚ù§Ô∏è Maps. I love looking at them, planning hikes with them, love reliving past trips with them, just folding them back into the original way, that I don‚Äôt love that much (I‚Äôm not so good at that). A map you don‚Äôt need to fold at all are the maps from <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">‚àû Awesome Maps</a> as you should frame them and hang them from your wall to look at. Like my <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/collections/canvas-world-maps/products/mountain-bike-mtb-trails-map-canvas?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">‚àû Mountain biking World Map</a>, which I put up in my man cave. I started to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/active-holidays-in-are-sweden.html">Downhill MTB in √Öre</a> a few years ago and absolutely love the sport, and I found this Awesome Map the prettiest - I love the style, colours and graphics.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49742174521/in/dateposted/" title="Awesome Mountainbiking Maps!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49742174521_25a275edc3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Awesome Mountainbiking Maps!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49741625368/in/dateposted/" title="Awesome Maps, North and Central America"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49741625368_abdebd9648_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Awesome Maps, North and Central America" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49741624818/in/dateposted/" title="Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49741624818_9fa621a91c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But Awesome Maps not only makes this Map - they make (in Germany!) <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/pages/our-maps?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">‚àû a dozen of inspiring outdoor maps</a>. And you don‚Äôt need to get them as a Canvas map either (though I highly recommend them!), the paper maps are just as pretty, more affordable and can also be easily hanged from the wall - either with the <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/products/wooden-oak-poster-hangers?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">‚àû handmade Oak hanging frame</a>, some Blue Tac or you get it framed at your local framing business! The paper maps are made from the good stuff, too: 250 gsm art paper which is acid free and silk coated, and you even can write on them with an whiteboard marker! That‚Äôs perfect if you wanna put a check ‚úÖ behind e.g. the trails you have hiked already!</p>

<h2 id="diy-frame-for-the-canvas-map">DIY Frame for the Canvas Map</h2>

<p>So that‚Äôs the canvas map Awesome Maps sent me, together with the <a href="https://awesome-maps.com/products/custom-made-diy-canvas-wood-frame-kit?ref=l25zUCEMqMjF">‚àû DIY Wood Canvas Frame</a>. I wanted the canvas map as it is larger and fits better into my man cave, and I also can hang it easily from the shelves in my man cave, as you hopefully agree üòä And even if you don‚Äôt agree, hanging the canvas map from the shelves means I can hide the things behind it easily!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49742175336/in/dateposted/" title="Assembled the frame myself, which was a nice DIY Project"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49742175336_671f6a922f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Assembled the frame myself, which was a nice DIY Project" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Assembling the DIY Frame was easy: All I needed was a hammer and a canvas stapler, both tools which I owned already. It was a easy 20 minutes task to assemble the frame and staple the canvas to it, and then it was just a question to bring the large map from the living room to the cellar!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49742175451/in/dateposted/" title="Finished Awesome Map!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49742175451_b5b65ccd42_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Finished Awesome Map!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There I used two hooks from my IKEA shelf to hang the map, and <em>Voil√°!</em> I have an awesome map to look at when I‚Äôm painting or packing or planning in my man cave!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49741624443/in/dateposted/" title="Awesome Maps made my Man Cave prettier!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49741624443_b3b9ca2e90_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Awesome Maps made my Man Cave prettier!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
