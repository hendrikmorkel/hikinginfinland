<p>Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic we‚Äôre all mostly <em>‚Äústuck at home‚Äù</em> in our countries - which isn‚Äôt a bad thing at all, as this allows us to go explore where we live and pay taxes! This pandemic also has brought a lot of people into the outdoors, and obviously the first thing you should familiarize yourself with are the <a href="https://lnt.org">Leave No Trace principles</a> so you don‚Äôt <em>accidentally</em> leave your trash and poo somewhere where it does not belong - don‚Äôt be one of those jerks who throws trash into nature. Now that we have these essential rules out of the way, let me show you the gear you need when you go backpacking. The idea is to help you <strong>save money and only get what you REALLY need</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quick Definition! Hiking: The activity of walking in nature, but sleeping indoors. Backpacking: The activity of walking AND sleeping outdoors in nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="clothes">Clothes</h2>

<p>The Easiest and most difficult point right at the start. The easiest because I firmly believe that most people can go hiking in their normal sports clothes on their first trips. If you have a synthetic/ wind-resistant pants or shorts for running or sports, chances are these are fine for your first backpacking trip. Some things to keep in mind, though:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don‚Äôt wear jeans when backpacking. They are too warm, too heavy, stay wet forever if it rains, and are mostly uncomfortable and restrict your movement.</li>
  <li>Except on the hottest 30¬∞C or more days, don‚Äôt wear cotton shirts. Like jeans, they need too long to dry and if it gets cool don‚Äôt keep you warm.</li>
  <li>Avoid heavy ‚Äúhiking‚Äù boots, use trailrunning or sport shoes with a good, grippy sole instead.</li>
  <li>Invest into some good socks and underwear for hiking!</li>
  <li>You can take a (fleece) jogging pants, a comfy shirt and possibly some woolen socks for camp along</li>
</ul>

<p>It is very easy to spend thousands of ¬£$‚Ç¨ on clothes for hiking, and completely unnecessary for a beginner. Some sports clothes or airy fabric trousers with good freedom of movement and maybe some wind resistance are fine, together with a synthetic or Merino wool T-shirt. Most people own a fleece jacket, which works fine for insulation on summer days, and most also own a rain jacket. If you really want to start to invest into clothes for backpacking I‚Äôd recommend getting a good pair of light trailrunning shoes. Now, you won‚Äôt be running, but these types of shoes are comfortable all day long, you are unlikely to get blisters in them, they have great grip on muddy, wet and slippery terrain and they also are light. Go on a few day hikes before you take them backpacking, to see if they work for you. In 99% of the cases, they do üòä!</p>

<p><em>A detailed article on garments for hiking and backpacking will follow this month, so stay tuned if this topic interests you!</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7807588712/in/album-72157630936718764/" title="You can&#x27;t climb mountains in trailrunners"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7131/7807588712_df00e66139_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="You can&#x27;t climb mountains in trailrunners" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And finally, under clothes - <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/swix-pro-trail-carbon-120-trekking-pole.html">trekking poles</a>. Some people swear on them for hiking, others are happy without them. I both like them when I need them - for example when fording rivers, hiking through swamps, and demanding terrain, and I also am happy without them. Hence I like Poles which fold up small and are light, so that when I carry them they fits nicely to the side of the pack. If trekking poles are for you - you might want to see for yourself and test some, maybe loan a pair from friends for a hike and see how you get on with them. However, if your shelter needs Poles - you probably will not get around using them!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7807416278" title="HMG Porter &amp; BD Z-Poles"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/8432/7807416278_d55bc283b3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="HMG Porter &amp; BD Z-Poles" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="kitchen--water">Kitchen &amp; Water</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs also easy to spend a few hundred ‚Ç¨$¬£ on the kitchen and water carrying stuff. For the start of your backpacking hobby, get a good water filter like the <a href="https://youtu.be/CneJY3F6zuY">Katadyn BeFree</a>. This filter is very easy to use, and while there sometimes are some durability issues with the flask the customer service from Katadyn is very good and quickly sends out replacement flasks. You might want to pick up a second light water bottle (I can recommend the <a href="https://cnocoutdoors.com/collections/vecto-family/products/2019-vecto-2l-28mm?variant=20550036357209">CNOC Vecto 2l</a>) if you hike in environments where there‚Äôs not a spring every few kilometres and for camp. I also always carry a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/10/kupilka-review.html">Kupilka Kuksa</a> - the bigger one is the ideal size to prepare TentMeals in, and also for a big cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998094941/in/photostream/" title="Water and drinking"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998094941_5880327b29_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Water and drinking" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I believe that gas stoves with a Piezo ignition are the most user-friendly for beginners and experts alike, and the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/primus-lite-gas-stove/?pid=10239">Primus Lite+ Stove</a> is the most affordable one in this segment. It is light, compact, available in a variety of nice colours and very easy to use. It works well for two people, and it is fast to bring water to a boil, too. Once you want to go backpacking more it is fine to do your research on <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/the-2nd-renaissance-of-esbit.html">other stoves</a>, but for beginners an easy and convenient to use gas stove is the best investment.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30287286992/in/album-72157675269849996/" title="Camp on the fourth morning"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/5680/30287286992_aeb90feb6a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Camp on the fourth morning" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="food--snacks">Food &amp; Snacks</h2>

<p>On a longer backpacking trip food and snacks will be the heaviest thing in your backpack. Food for a week weighs for me around 5 kg, give or take, and happily this gets lighter every day. I have a plant-based diet and it‚Äôs completely possible to have nutritious, tasty vegan backpacking meals every day for a week without that you feel like <em>‚ÄúUuuagh, again the same?!‚Äù</em>. If you eat everything, it gets even easier. My favourite vegan meals are from Tent Meals and my Patreons get a 25% discount on their orders, so it‚Äôs totally worth it to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hendrikmorkel">join my Patreon tribe</a> and save on these tasty meals. Also FirePot, LYO Food, Bl√•Band and REAL Turmat make good vegan backpacking meals, and as this is going to fuel your adventure, don‚Äôt save money on these. I made that mistake on my first backpacking trips, thinking that a normal ‚Äújust add water‚Äù meal from the Supermarket is just as good, and I <strong>a)</strong> didn‚Äôt feel like eating them after two days and <strong>b)</strong> they don‚Äôt deliver the same amount of calories than the specialized backpacking meals. It feels expensive to spend 7 to 10‚Ç¨ on one backpacking dinner, but it‚Äôs really worth it - and if you‚Äôd be in a city, you would easily spend more than that on a dinner!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/41423900054/in/dateposted/" title="Dinner!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/950/41423900054_46cce273b3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dinner!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As for Snacks, I am a huge fan of honey-roasted and chili nuts with some chocolate raisins thrown in for variety. I also know that especially the Nuts will make you hugely popular with fellow hikers, so take enough to last you and a friend through the trip :) I also consume the <a href="https://www.clifbar.com/products/clif/bloks-energy-chews/black-cherry">ClifBar Bloks</a> as they are excellent to get fast energy, are tasty, and really easy to use. I have tried normal ClifBars on various trips, but for me they simply are <em>‚Äútoo much‚Äù</em> and I prefer the Bloks + Nuts.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998095301/in/photostream/" title="Snacks"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998095301_6d1a8796db_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snacks" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Coffee, Tea and Hot Chocolate are my hot drinks staples when outdoors. I have a minimum of three <a href="https://www.naturata.de/bio-produkte/kaffee-kakao/espresso-kaffee-sticks-bohnenkaffee-instant-25g/">Naturata Espresso Sticks</a> per day with me, these are easier to source than the equally good Starbucks Via, then one or two bags of tea per day, and one bag of Hot chocolate per day, as my little treat before going to sleep. Other than that I drink water, water, water, just like home =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998346927/in/dateposted/" title="Tea, Coffee, Hot Chocolate"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998346927_3a6581e412_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tea, Coffee, Hot Chocolate" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="hygiene--first-aid">Hygiene &amp; First Aid</h2>

<p>Thanks to the Pandemic we all know that we should wash our hands, outdoors this is maybe even a tad more important as we usually touch stones, trees, roots, plants and dirt when we scramble up places or walk through nature. So a good bio-degradable soap (I recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/2URUK51">Dr. Bonners Mint</a>) needs to come along, as well as a small bottle of Disinfectant. You always should brush your teeth, so a tooth brush, some tooth silk or a tooth pick, and a bio-degradable toothpaste (I prefer <a href="https://amzn.to/3hf6aJz">Dent Tabs</a> by far) need to go into the Hygiene kit, and then anything else one might want or need (stuff for contact lenses for example). I also always carry a ClimbOn LipBalm as it is great to not get dry lips and also can be applied to mosquito bites or small cuts. If you are popular with Mosquitos, an insect repellant is good to take along, or you use a headnet and long clothes to keep them off. Similarly sunscreen is useful on hikes where there is no shade and you expect to hike in the sun. You don‚Äôt need to buy these things except maybe the soap and disinfectant - use on your first hikes the same things you have at home.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998094766/in/photostream/" title="My Hygine Kit"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998094766_6ca06ba24a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="My Hygine Kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My First Aid kit is absolut minimalist, there‚Äôs a small bottle of mint oil (it works great against headaches for me), a few painkillers and band-aids in there, and that is it. I also have here a small repair kit - some patches for my air mattress, some duct tape, a security needle and that‚Äôs that. If I <strong>really</strong> need medical attention I prefer to call for help instead of trying to patch myself up with some surgical dressings which you find in the 1st Aid kits you can buy everywhere. And as in my Hygiene and First Air Kit I also have a <em>‚Äúlarge‚Äù</em> towel I can use that as a bandage if I feel I can take care of myself. Speaking of the towel, I long thought I don‚Äôt need it, but it has proven to be something that is multi-functional and hence comes along again: I can dry myself after a dip in a river or lake, wipe the dew from my shelter in the morning, hold a hot pot with it or, as above, use it as a band-aid üòÉ</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49997574068/in/photostream/" title="FA Kit"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49997574068_231c047b73_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="FA Kit" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="backpack">Backpack</h2>

<p>Now actually I‚Äôd put the backpack as the latest item you buy, but as this item sits totally in-between day hiking and backpacking I feel I can not talk about it at the end. However, I recommend getting this as the last item if possible, simply as it means you can purchase one which fits all the gear and food which you will have for your backpacking trips. Backpacks are a difficult topic and what works for one person does not necessarily work for another one. If you have a small, local outdoor shop go visit them, but don‚Äôt let them sell you the most expensive or heavy backpack. Osprey and Gregory are two brands which make nowadays good lightweight backpacks with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/01/osprey-levity-45-review.html">Exos</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/11/osprey-exos-48-review.html">Levity</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/10/gregory-optic-48.html">Optic</a> (women models are available for these, too!) and these are the models you should ask for in your shop. A backpack which has around 50 l is a good volume to aim for, with some careful packing it is good for all the gear a backpacking beginner takes along, plus the food, and this size pack also still works fine for day hikes as you can compress them nicely.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49997573963/in/photostream/" title="Packs!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49997573963_f4ee567bc6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Packs!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now real ultralight backpacking brands like <a href="https://www.huckepacks.de">HUCKEPACKS</a>, Sierra Designs, Six Moon Designs and Gossamer Gear, to name just a few, are pretty much only available online. If you want, it is totally worth it to purchase one of their backpacks, though you‚Äôll need to measure your back length, make decisions on materials and features you want, which is already quite a bit of research - of course you just can <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">read my reviews</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hendrikmorkel">watch my videos</a> to do that research, and buy accordingly üòÉ But again, I believe that a beginner should visit a independent, local gear shop and ask for one of these backpacks mentioned above, and try if they work for her or him. So far 100% of the people who got one of these packs after my recommendation are really happy with them, which is why I feel confident in recommending them (they are great packs, too!). If you then decide to pursue backpacking as a hobby you can get one of the lighter packs from the cottage brands!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/44199759745/in/album-72157702073100795/" title="Stor√•d√∂rren Valley from the other side n better weather"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/1903/44199759745_b4b7e1753e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Stor√•d√∂rren Valley from the other side n better weather" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="shelter">Shelter</h2>

<p>While a backpack usually doesn‚Äôt cost more than 200‚Ç¨ with the shelter and sleep system we get into an area where things get pricey. My recommendations here are to get good quality kit which does not break the bank for a beginner, if one wants to go backpacking more there‚Äôs always the option to get something different. I think most people want something which keeps bugs out (as them  üï∑ ü¶Ç are out in force in the summer). The <a href="https://www.tarptent.com/product/double-rainbow/">Double Rainbow from Tarptent</a> is a proven design at a really good price. A tent with a similar construction, slightly heavier but way easier to get in Europe and elsewhere, is the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/msr-elixir-2-2-man-tent/?pid=10239">MSR Elixir 2</a>. If your budget is a bit higher then the <a href="https://www.outdoorline.sk/en/tents/big-agnes-fly-creek-hv-ul2-ultralight-tent">Big Agnes Fly Creek HV UL2</a> or the <a href="https://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/equipment-c3/tents-shelters-c25/two-person-tents-c26/lunar-duo-explorer-2p-tent-p3325">Six Moon Designs Lunar Duo Explorer 2P Tent</a> are very good picks.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49997180938/in/dateposted/" title="Camp"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49997180938_ed7115939b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Camp" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I myself really like to sleep under a Tarp or in a Pyramide-style shelter. The <a href="https://locusgear.com/items/hapi-sil/?lang=en">Locus Gear Hapi Sil</a> is an amazing Pyramide tent, the <a href="https://www.gossamergear.com/collections/shelters-sleeping-pads/products/twinn-tarp">Gossamer Gear Twinn Tarp</a> is an absolute Classic which is easy to pitch and has a lot of dry space under it, and the <a href="https://www.astucas.com/en/products/millaris-bivy-sack/">As Tucas Millaris Bivy Sack</a> works with either of these shelters or on it‚Äôs own if the sky is clear!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/38085020741/in/dateposted/" title="Locus Gear Hapi Sil in the morning"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4469/38085020741_56f5f2ece7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Locus Gear Hapi Sil in the morning" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If you go backpacking in Finland, Sweden or Norway you also might be able to not take a shelter at all, as you could sleep simply in one of the hundreds of free, open Wilderness Huts. The problem which might arise is that the hut is full and you can‚Äôt sleep there, so having a shelter along is always recommended. There are Huts in Finland which you can reserve, so the <em>‚ÄúThe Hut is full‚Äù</em> Problem won‚Äôt arise. And while these huts are AMAZING I do like to sleep outside, hear the birds chirp and the wind blow through the leafs. Plus you won‚Äôt be awoken by other hut inhabitants when they leave at 5:00 o‚Äôclock.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/37340978576/in/dateposted/" title="Str√∂mskojan Inside"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4435/37340978576_f69dcfda81_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Str√∂mskojan Inside" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="sleep-system">Sleep System</h2>

<p>Your sleep system consists of a sleeping pad, a quilt or sleeping bag and possibly a pillow (I use a insulation jacket and fold it into a pillow). The <a href="https://youtu.be/5oXFCJi0TII">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Uberlite</a> is an outstanding mattress, but maybe beginners are a bit better off with getting a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite.html">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite</a> as it is more durable and cheaper while still being light and compact. If you like to sleep on a hard underground, then the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.eu/exped-flexmat-plus-sleeping-mat/?pid=10239">Exped Flexmat Plus</a> is a great pick as it can not break and at 40‚Ç¨ it is really cheap, while being very comfortable.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49998095396/in/photostream/" title="Sleeping well"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49998095396_73cbece14b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sleeping well" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At home you sleep under a duvet, and outdoors the next best thing is a quilt. I really like my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2018/05/as-tucas-sestrals-quilt.html">As Tucas Sestrals Quilt</a>, also the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/enlightened-equipment-revelation-quilts.html">enLIGHTened Equipment Revelation Quilts</a> are a very good pick, and if money is no issue I suggest getting a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/01/katabatic-gear-sawatch-quilt.html">Katabatic Gear Quilt</a>. If social and sustainable issues are important to you, have a look at the good <a href="http://tidd.ly/3d3b83f5">Vaude Alpstein 450</a>, which is a really good quilt. Again, there‚Äôs a lot of options here, but amongst those which I mentioned you can find something which suits your budget and needs!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/42298562271" title="As Tucas Sestrals Quilt, front view"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/878/42298562271_534ffe1d92_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="As Tucas Sestrals Quilt, front view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="navigation-maps-and-extras">Navigation, Maps and Extras</h2>

<p>The final point on my list is about the small items which are needed to not get lost and to remember. A map and compass are pretty useful when going into nature, and I recommend for the first few trips that you stay on trails and use the map to get safely from A to B. Also an App like <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/383480947">HikePack</a> is very good to navigate (and there‚Äôs a free version!), and might be easier to use than a compass and map for beginners (despite this, the latter are important skills to learn and master!). I also carry a small <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/expedition">Field Notes Brand notebook</a> + pen with me, and obviously a camera. Unless you‚Äôre already a photographer and own a good camera, just use your phone for photos. If this is an aspect you‚Äôd like to pursue more passionately at some point, feel free to hit me up on Twitter and ask me about camera recommendations! Finally, a headlamp like the <a href="http://tidd.ly/d33332f9">Petzl Bindi</a> is good to have along if you need to get out at night or if you get up early/ stay up late. Here in the North it‚Äôs something you not necessarily need in the summer, as it doesn‚Äôt really get dark.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The best thing is if you simply could ask a good friend (like me, right Tumppi ;) who totally is into outdoor stuff and has a bunch of gear to kit you out for your first backpacking trip. That way you can see what works for you and don‚Äôt need to make purchases which may work well for you. But not everyone has that friend, so the next best thing is to do your research online, learn from other people‚Äôs mistakes and experience, and buy the right gear from the start (this does involve trusting these friends, and not deciding to throw away all the recommendations and simply buy what you think is best, just to realize after some use that the knowledgable friend actually was right all along‚Ä¶). To make checking the gear you have &amp; need easier I made <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bjsgcr5KmPblSjvjvQs3To6iCU7LYqNBczFazSJNX80/edit?usp=sharing">this Checklist</a> which you can copy &amp; paste or print out. With the list in your hands you make sure you don‚Äôt waste money on kit which you don‚Äôt need, and my tips here hopefully help you figure out which gear is worth getting. The most important thing, however, is to enjoy being outdoors.</p>

<p>Backpacking in nature is the single best way to connect to the natural environment, learn to appreciate it and see why it is so important to protect wild places. For us humans going into nature has a tremendously positive effect on our mental health, creativity and also our physical health, as several scientific articles have highlights in the past couple of years. And the whole experience of backpacking gets more enjoyable &amp; fun the less unnecessary &amp; heavy equipment we carry along while outdoors. With this article read you now know what gear you need for your first backpacking trip, and I hope it will be a most memorable one!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>‚ÄúFinland, Finland, Finland, it‚Äôs the country where I want to be‚Äù</em>  is a great song by Monty Python, and now that you have it stuck in your head you probably want to find out about the best hiking destinations in this Northern European country which is well-known for its 180.000 lakes, 75% forest cover and more than a million of Saunas!</p>

<p>Finland has the Everyman‚Äôs Right, and with it come one <a href="https://www.nationalparks.fi/en/worldheritagesites">UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site</a>, seven <a href="https://www.nationalparks.fi/en/nationalhikingareas">National Hiking Areas</a>, ten <a href="https://www.nationalparks.fi/en/wildernessareas">Wilderness Areas</a>, 40 <a href="https://www.nationalparks.fi/en/nationalparks">National Parks</a>, more than two dozen <a href="https://www.nationalparks.fi/en/othernaturesites">Nature Sites</a> and hundreds of open Wilderness Huts and Lean-to Shelters, which are accessible for every hiker, bikepacker and packrafter visiting them.

<p>As Finland is a large country it might be difficult to pick an outdoor destination to visit - as you see above, there‚Äôs quite some options.

<h2 id="hetta-pallas-trail">Hetta-Pallas Trail</h2>

<p>Fresh in my mind is the Hetta-Pallas Trail, which I skied in March this year. Besides amazingly cozy huts the scenery is MINDBLOWING. No wonder this is one of Finland‚Äôs first National Parks and one of the oldest hiking trail (it was known as Pallas-Ounastunturi National Park till 2005, when it was doubled in size as the Yll√§s-Aakenus Nature Reserve was put together with the old National Park). What I loved the most on the Hetta-Pallas Trail were the fjells and the views. Going south from Hetta this amazing view of the fjells opens up, and once you have climbed the first summit you can see far into the distance and enjoy this breath-taking scenery. In the summer the trail takes you across the highest summits, and is definitely something I will return for!</p>

<h2 id="st-olavs-trail">St. Olavs Trail</h2>

<p>The St. Olavs trail is a former pilgrimage path leading from Turku in Finland, to the √Öland Islands, through Sweden and all the way to Trondheim in Norway. The Finnish part of the trail is leading you through the Finnish archipelago with stunning views of the countless islands. The trail is pretty easy and accessible, with accommodation options along the way if you don‚Äôt feel like camping. For those who love the water, this trail is a true gem - and my favourite in Finland.</p>

<h2 id="sipoonkorpi-national-park">Sipoonkorpi National Park</h2>

<p>As we now are already pretty far south in Finland, it‚Äôs good to shed some light ‚Äú<em>on the other National Park near Helsinki</em>‚Äù. Nuuksio is normally already pretty busy with hikers, and now that everyone and their dog head into the forest you better jump on a bus to Sipoonkorpi National Park. You can find some great trails and spots for a lunch here, Sipoo is small enough to explore it in a day if you hike fast, and big enough for a long weekend to see all parts of the National Park and not needing to hurry through it.</p>

<h2 id="repovesi-national-park">Repovesi National Park</h2>

<p>Finnish climbers love Repovesi National Park, as it is home to some of the highest rock climbing routes - and definitely the most picturesque. Where else can you take a rowboat to the start of a climbing route? But also hikers, backpackers and packrafters love Repovesi National Park with its great hanging bridges, beautiful lakes and channels for paddling, not to mention the great viewing points from the top of the hills which dot the forested landscape. What is unique, too, is the possibility to use a fox-ferry, and if you want you to paddle with a packraft or canoe here, you‚Äôll find great lakes &amp; channels which connect them.</p>

<h2 id="helvetinjrvi--seitseminen-national-parks">Helvetinj√§rvi &amp; Seitseminen National Parks</h2>

<p>I have been a lot to these two National Parks, as they were the closest to the city of Tampere where I lived for five years. They‚Äôre pretty, with great infrastructure, cultural sights and always good for a surprise - be it the warm water of the lakes which are inviting for a swim, or the tasty mushrooms which you can find in the forest. There‚Äôs surprisingly few people around during the week, but in the weekends the famous spots attract a lot of people - these can be avoided if you go to the less popular (but just as pretty) spots in the two National Parks!</p>

<h2 id="ruka-kuusamo-area">Ruka-Kuusamo Area</h2>

<p>The Ruka-Kuusamo area and Oulanka National Park are one of the most popular hiking destinations in Finland - and for a good reason. This area is known for old forests, deep river canyons &amp; rapids and in the winter you¬¥ll find the most picturesque snowy trees here. The location in North-East Finland makes this place an interesting combination of Arctic Nature and Siberian Taiga, you can see it in both Flora and Fauna. The most famous trail is the Bear‚Äôs Trail but there are many other options for hikers too. Scrambling up the Konttainen Hill and gazing the Midnight Sun is one of our traditions that we do every Summer. There are so many beautiful Outdoor destinations in Finland but for it‚Äôs versatility this area is definitely one of our top destinations!</p>

<h2 id="urho-kekkonen-national-park">Urho Kekkonen National Park</h2>

<p>The Urho Kekkonen National Park is something of a national treasure in Finland. It has it all: Amazing off-the-beaten track backpacking through the fjells, great views, lovely lakes and rivers, cozy huts and a lot of Saunas in which to relax after a day of hiking. It is the choice for more advanced backpackers who know how to navigate and feel comfortable to hike away from the few trails, and who obviously also know how to practice Leave-No-Trace. If that‚Äôs you - start planning a hike in this beautiful National Park!</p>

<h2 id="pyrisjrvi">P√∂yrisj√§rvi</h2>

<p>Almost like sitting in the shoulders of the Maiden of Finland (Suomineito), the P√∂yrisj√§rvi wilderness area is a dream hiking destination for experienced hikers and people who love to fish. The area takes its name from Lake P√∂yrisj√§rvi, surrounded by the photogenic sand dunes, large woodlands and hilly fells. Endless hiking possibilities will take you around the wilderness as long and as far as you have power to go. Pro tip: bass loves the combination of black, blue and gold. Try it, and you might have a chance to cook a delicious dinner for your crew! Remember to bring some butter and salt along!</p>

<h2 id="ksivarsi-wilderness-area">K√§sivarsi Wilderness Area</h2>

<p>My favorite hiking destination in Finland is K√§sivarsi Wilderness Area. While I occasionally enjoy cruising down a well-groomed trail, nothing beats walking off-trail in a remote wilderness. While there‚Äôs a good trail system to explore parts of the area, my favorite thing is to take the seaplane to one of the lakes in the furthest corners of the area, next to the Norwegian border, and then hike my way back to Kilpisj√§rvi.</p>

<p>One good thing which came out of the COVID-19 Pandemic is that we now go hiking every Sunday with the family. All four of us look forward to the outing, and some rain in the forecast doesn‚Äôt cancel our plans. We have rain clothes, after all - and the kids are even happier as it allows them to jump in every puddle along the trail! Good thing that we life in the sunniest part of Finland and that it hasn‚Äôt rained a lot here yet.</p>

<p>The most import things for our family hikes are: Some breads as a snack, a M√ºsli bar treat which we share, some water or hot juice to drink and proper clothes for the occasion. As it gets warmer now in Vaasa, it‚Äôs nice to wear less - maybe a couple more weeks and I can slip on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a>!</p>

<p>Last Sunday we went to a close-by nature area, and hiked some two kilometres to a birdwatching tower. While the snow is gone since months (it was another terrible winter here in the south), spring comes late in this part of Finland and only during the past week the trees started to drive out the first buds and leaves. In another week everything will be over, and the trees will be green and summer will start!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49931073187/in/dateposted/" title="Layers"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49931073187_c82f947aff_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Layers" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>An important aspect of our family hikes is to keep them short-ish and interesting. Both kids much prefer forest trails to gravel roads, and around 2 km one-way seems a good distance for us right now - with a break and then another 2 km back to the start. We parents also prefer the forest trails, they feel much nicer because you‚Äôre ‚Äúcloser‚Äù to nature. On this hike there were also no Mosquitos, and only little noise pollution from the nearby roads.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49930250643/in/dateposted/" title="Green"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49930250643_3691e04f41_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Green" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There were surprisingly many families out on this trail - which is good to see, as it means more people start to value their local nature, and maybe become more engaged in protecting the environment.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49930765536/in/dateposted/" title="Dot"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49930765536_245705b8b8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dot" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In the end it was a relaxed, good little hike. We saw a white-tailed eagle from the bird watching tower (even without my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/05/vortex-optics-viper-hd-binoculars.html">binoculars</a>!) and lots of smaller singing birds, which were merrily chirping in the green woods. Our little family hikes make us all feel better, and especially I really value these little adventures outdoors.</p>
