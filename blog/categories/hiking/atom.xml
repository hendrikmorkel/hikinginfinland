<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>I found the WRIGHTSOCK Escape and Merino Stride socks good for hiking and every-day use, but got blisters on my shins when using the Merino Coolmesh II otc socks for skiing. When hiking and in normal use I didn’t get any Blisters, and my feet were less sweaty, but I still had moist feet after a day of hiking. Overall I think they’re good socks for colder weather and activities where you usually get really sweaty feet.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>My WRIGHTSOCK package arrived in late November, and contained a pair of COOLMESH II Merino, ESCAPE crew and MERINO STRIDE crew, all in Size Large (which fits feet between 41,5 and 45). They have been used all for several weeks, mostly for day hikes and normal, every-day use.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49592209382/in/dateposted-public/" title="A package of WRIGHTSOCK socks!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49592209382_0542d0f3e8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="A package of WRIGHTSOCK socks!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The function of a sock is to absorb perspiration (= sweat!) as your feet are one of the biggest producers of sweat. Socks help to absorb the sweat from your feet and transport it to areas where air can evaporate the perspiration. And in cold weather, socks should insulate the foot and keep it toasty.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>All of the WRIGHTSOCK socks I tested were at least partly made from Dri-Wright, which is a Polyester fibre. Polyester dries quickly and keeps it shape/ form well, hence it is a good material for socks.</li>
  <li>All socks have an inner and outer layer, this construction is supposed to protect from blisters and help you keep dry feet</li>
  <li>Some of the socks I tested also had a Merino wool layer/ fabric, which made them less smelly and warmer</li>
  <li>And all socks also had a “stabilization zone” knitted into the metatarsal area</li>
</ul>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49592208062/in/dateposted-public/" title="Merino Stride socks"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49592208062_b86754082d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Merino Stride socks" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The socks have held up well over the past three months and still look good. They can be washed at 40° which gets them nice and clean after a few days of use, and I expect them to hold at least another year or two of regular use.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The weight of the socks, as a pair (so both socks!), in Size Large, are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wrightsockshop.de/wrightsock/sockenhoehen/otc-kniehoch/19/merino-coolmesh-ii-otc">Merino Coolmesh II otc socks</a>: 88 g</li>
  <li><a href="https://wrightsockshop.de/wrightsock/sportarten/outdoor-wandern/177/merino-stride-crew">Merino Stride socks</a>: 64 g</li>
  <li><a href="https://wrightsockshop.de/wrightsock/sportarten/outdoor-wandern/180/escape-crew">Escape socks</a>: 84 g</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I’ll look at two different use-cases here: Using the Merino Coolmesh II otc socks for skiing and using the Escape and Merino Stride socks for hiking and every-day use. Lets start with skiing and the Merino Coolmesh II otc socks. I sweat a LOT when I ski, and it doesn’t matter if it is skitouring and skinning up a mountain or just riding the whole day in the front country - I have soaking wet socks after a day on skis. I used the Merino Coolmesh II otc with my <a href="http://tidd.ly/5d07ff6d">La Sportiva Synchro</a> in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2020/02/father-son-ski-trip.html">Ruka</a> for two days, and already after the first day I had a strange feeling on my shins, but didn’t pay any attention to it. That was a mistake.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49547590647/in/dateposted-public/" title="DPS Cassiar 87"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49547590647_7d16bb5e33_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DPS Cassiar 87" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49591466298/in/dateposted-public/" title="Merino Coolmesh II otc socks"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49591466298_f76f4d55d8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Merino Coolmesh II otc socks" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After the second day on the slopes I had on each leg a big blister on my shins. I never had blisters on my shins, ever before, so you can imagine I was really surprised to find blisters on my legs from using socks which claim they don’t give you blisters! Needless to say, I didn’t use the socks for skiing after that anymore, and would not use the socks for skiing ever again. This is even more surprising as I was literally only downhill skiing, in a light boot which was fastened as usual. On the plus side, my feet were slightly less sweaty, but they still were moist when I took the socks off.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the Escape and Merino Stride socks, which I used for hiking and in everyday use. Currently we have the shittiest winter ever and no snow, but temps still drop down to -11°C or more in the mornings, and only slowly it rises throughout the day. In this weather these socks have been really good, and they kept my feet toasty and warm, even if I wore less warm shoes like the new <a href="http://tidd.ly/e9815221">Black Diamond Mission LT</a> shoes (I usually wear in the colder months the <a href="http://tidd.ly/ed40ce05">La Sportiva Crossover 2.0</a>). The Merino Stride socks are ideal for daily use as they can dry nicely inside, and they are toasty warm outside in the cold weather. The Escape is also great, though maybe a tiny bit less warm. Overall, as this are double-layer socks, they are warmer than other socks of a comparable weight, as in between the layers air is trapped, which helps keep your feet warm.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49592210972/in/dateposted-public/" title="WRIGHTSOCK Escape socks + Black Diamond Mission LT"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49592210972_99ca71d410_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="WRIGHTSOCK Escape socks + Black Diamond Mission LT" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Two things, though: I usually never get Blisters anymore as I use good shoes for hiking, backpacking, trailrunning and in every-day use, so I can not say that the claim of not getting Blisters when hiking with these socks works. Secondly, I still had moist feet when I took the socks off after a day outside, however, they were less sweaty than with normal socks. So while I still got sweaty feet they were less moist than with a normal pair of socks. I also liked the extra “cushioning” these socks had because of the two layers, and they also felt nice and comfortable on my feet - the white inner sock has a minimal amount of seams, which is really positive in my book.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/49591961861/in/dateposted-public/" title="WRIGHTSOCK Escape socks"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49591961861_e98909d904_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="WRIGHTSOCK Escape socks" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I don’t have suggestions for improvement, to be honest.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>Overall I liked the WRIGHTSOCK Escape and Merino Stride socks, and will use the Merino Coolmesh II otc socks for normal use when it’s cold, but not for skiing anymore. The Escape and Merino Stride socks are both well suited for backpacking and hiking, and the Escape sock definitely is the better pick for multi-day backpacking trips as it is made completely from synthetic materials and hence should dry faster than the Merino Stride socks. However, as most ultralight backpackers are well-used to hiking in wet footwear and hence moist socks, I think also the Merino Stride socks should be fine for backpacking. Especially if you have a problem with Blisters and really sweaty feet you might want to try these socks (<em>and please let me know if the “No Blisters System” works for you!</em>)!</p>

<p>We rolled into the <a href="https://arcticskylapland.com">Arctic Sky</a> parking lot and I immediately felt like this is a good place. Beautiful wooden buildings, a herb garden on the side, and a traditional <em>Kota</em> being built to gather in in the evenings. Minna welcomed us in, and it almost felt like I entered my own home. Minna and her partner Aarno have built this small resort - ten people can stay here – from 400 year old lumber which they picked up in southern Finland and transported here to the far North, and then continued to decorate their house and the Guesthouse in a wonderful cozy style, from the hand-made woolen socks which you can slip into at the door to the beautiful animal prints which give each of the five guest rooms their names. Yes, you can stay at Arctic Sky, but I was here for an introduction to nordic Herbs and then some searching and cooking some wild food, as part of my <a href="https://polarlifeoutdoor.com">Polarlife Outdoors</a> experience.</p>

<p>So after a look through the cozy house we shouldered our packs, grabbed each a woven basket and headed into the woods to find some Mushrooms, pick berries, and hike to a Laavu to prepare our findings into a tasty meal.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743747866/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Shrooms"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743747866_b4380edc27_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Shrooms" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743926902/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Bilberries"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743926902_e6243172ec_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Bilberries" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We hiked on the Ruijanpolku, a trail I didn’t exist, and which is a rather old and long trail. I might need to return to go backpacking on it some day in the future, but right now I was more occupied with finding tasty mushrooms and bilberries for our desert. It’s funny how I can completely can zoom-in on searching mushrooms, and the hunter &amp; gatherer in me is also one which isn’t happy with having a full basket of mushrooms - I always want to find more 😃</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743926192/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Ruijanpolku"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743926192_314866f63c_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Ruijanpolku" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After a very successful search for mushrooms, and learning to identify a few new ones (that is one of the benefits of going mushroom picking with someone!) we arrived at a very wonderful Laavu next to a lovely stream. We weren’t alone, though - many dayhikers enjoyed this beautiful spot, eating snacks, drinking tea, and grilling sausages. Also, I made a new friend.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743934682/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Siberian Jay"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743934682_c54826a8dd_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Siberian Jay" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>While I was busy snapping the next Konsta Punkka image Minna was busy preparing our food.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743752121/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Preparing shrooms"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743752121_1ba5987ca0_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Preparing shrooms" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The smell of mushrooms which sizzle over the fire in a pan is something so mouth-watering, just the thought of them makes me want to grab my coat and head out into the forest to go find some mushrooms!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743417398/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Tasty starter!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743417398_fae60f2fe5_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Tasty starter!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But while the mushrooms were frying in the pan we ate our starter, which we prepared ourselves from the things Minna brought along. We garnished it with some of the herbs we picked in her garden, and yes, it was as tasty as it looks!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743418023/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Even more tasty Main!"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743418023_2549c115da_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Even more tasty Main!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then it was time for the main course, our fried mushrooms were served with a vegan nettle pancake and some again we could use the different herbs we picked earlier to garnish it. These mushroom pancakes were so tasty that I ate three of them - just so much to leave some space for the dessert!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743419953/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Dessert Volume II"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743419953_65b9833a8c_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Dessert Volume II" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A lingonberry mousse in a dark chocolate coat, together with a bilberry sauce which we prepared from the berries we picked along the way. Oh my, this indeed was a sweet finish to an outstanding meal! If you now feel hungry - then no worries, Minna is happy to take you out on a hike like this! When you stay with Minna and Aarno at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fi/arctic-sky-lapland.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Arctic Sky Resort</a> you can pick and choose from a <a href="https://arcticskylapland.com/your-own-arctic-wellness-week">great variety of activities</a>, including the one you just read about! I definitely would recommend going with a few friends or the family, that way you can enjoy sitting in the cozy kitchen in the evenings, play some UNO or another board game, and chat while it slowly gets dark outside!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743758731/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Wood"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743758731_5c2a1e9a1b_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Wood" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After all that tasty food and the hike back I got a ride to the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fi/muotka-igloos.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Wilderness Hotel Muotka</a>, but not to lay down and rest - nope. I did the most typical thing you can do in Finland: Going to Sauna.</p>

<p>Now while I didn’t much enjoy my river crossings in the Hammastunturi Wilderness, at Muotka I even went to swim in the stream several times! I reckon if a warm Sauna and dry clothes are waiting for you, going into a cold stream is less of an issue 😃 Obviously going to chill by a fireplace in the sun afterwards makes a dip in the cold stream even less of a problem.</p>

<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities!</h2>

<p>I stayed in Saariselkä, which is probably <em>THE</em> place to be when you want to explore the North-Eastern corner of Finnish Lapland - or you stay at <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fi/arctic-sky-lapland.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Arctic Sky</a> if you want to be enjoy a more silent stay. Besides a dozen or more options for accommodation options - I stayed at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fi/lapland-riekonlinna.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna‎</a> - the village lays right at the border of the Urho Kekkonen National Park and is just a short 2 hour stroll away from the Hammastunturi Wilderness Area. This means you don’t need a car to go outdoors in Saariselkä, as you can walk in a few minutes from your Hotel or log cabin to the start of a trail. Here’s the <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=900040403&amp;aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&amp;room1=A">full list of Hotels and Cabins in Saariselkä</a>, and feel free to use that Affiliate Link when you’re making a reservation!</p>

<p>Getting to Saariselkä happens in one of three ways: You drive your car north for a veeeeeeery long time but are mobile there. Useful if you want to drive to different places, but hopefully you’re not alone in that car! The second and best option is to take the train and Bus. Taking the Bus from Rovaniemi to Saariselkä is a short and scenic 3 hour ride, and it really gets you in the mood for the outdoors as you ride past lakes and forests and every so often slow down to let the Reindeer get off the road. Taking an (overnight) train to Rovaniemi from Southern Finland is also very convenient, as you wake up well rested and just a short ride away from your next outdoor adventure. This is also a good way to travel if you want to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/outdoors-in-helsinki.html">explore Helsinki</a> before or after a visit in Lapland. Finally, if you come from abroad you also can fly directly to Ivalo, from where you can take a bus or Taxi to Saariselkä.</p>

<p>Saariselkä has for a village its size a variety of different options for eating out, from Anne’s Garden which serves delicious Burgers (great for backpackers who just returned to civilization!) to fine dining at Santa’s Hotel Tunturi and Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna‎ or the tasty Buffet at the Holiday Club. Cafe Porotupa at the market square makes really good coffee (On a side note, I’m always baffled how much bad coffee you get served in a variety of places in Finland, the World Champion in coffee consumption) and also fresh pancakes and cakes. If you rather cook yourself, then the supermarket in the village has everything you need, or if you need to stock-up on dehydrated meals for another backpacking trip then visit the <a href="https://www.partioaitta.fi/myymalat/saariselka/">Partioaitta Saariselkä</a>, probably the most-northern Outdoor Store in Finland!</p>

<p>During my visit at Saariselkä I participated in many different <a href="https://polarlifeoutdoor.com">Polarlife Outdoors</a> activities, include going to the Sauna and Spa at the Holiday Club, hiking on one of the dozen of trails around the village, visiting the AMAZING Aurora Open Wilderness Hut when you want to see Northern Lights, participate in a wild herbs Workshop, visit a Sauna and going to swim in a stream, or rent a Mountainbike and explore one of the many single track trails and holler with joy when you ride down the fjell!

<p>During my visit at Saariselkä I participated in several <a href="https://polarlifeoutdoor.com">Polarlife Outdoors</a> activities, and hiking with Henna was one of the highlights. Not only do I know how to hike, after five days in the Wilderness of Hammastunturi it was nice to have a chat with another person again! Henna from <a href="https://www.laplandlife.net/">Laplandlife</a> picked me up at my Hotel in Saariselkä and we hit it off right from the bat. She’s an upbeat, happy young women who after studying across Finland decided to return home to Lapland and combine all her passions and create her own business. That business is Laplandlife, and with it Henna takes people who visit the Ivalo-Saariselkä Region hiking, camping and berry picking in the summer, and snowshoeing, arctic swimming and ice fishing in the winter. As a professional massage therapist she also can help you relax after a day outdoors, and her <a href="https://www.laplandlife.net/wilderness-cabins/">Wilderness Cabins</a> are so far off-the-beaten track that you can be sure to not encounter anyone else during your stay there!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48780880326/in/dateposted/" title="Along the lake"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48780880326_99d464e289_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Along the lake" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Henna and I, however, were off to hike to the summit of Akupää. <em>“It’s in my backyard”</em> she told me as we drove to Ivalo, and silently I was wondering what that meant. What it meant became clear when we arrived: We passed a gate while she explained that all this land here, hundreds of hectares, belong to her dad. We drove to the end of a gravel road next to a most picturesque lake, the start of our hike. <em>“At the other side of the lake, well-hidden between the trees and far apart, are the two cabins”</em> Henna hold me, and I was already wondering how amazing it must be to spend a holiday here. No noise except the wind in the trees and the calls of birds could be heard, it’s exactly the kind of sounds I love and which you don’t get in the city.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743901177/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Autumn light"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743901177_787b3c0e11_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Autumn light" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Along the lake we hiked on game trails and small forest roads, all the time chatting about outdoor life in Lapland. After half an hour Henna offered me some home-made berry juice which was delicious, and then we set off slowly to climb towards the summit of Akupää. Completely off-trail we hiked through the most beautiful autumn birch and pine forests, often stopping to pick some bilberries and lingonberries which were growing in abundance on the floor of the forest.</p>

<p>Here and there the forest opened up where trees have fallen, and we revelled in the beauty of it all under the sunshine on this autumn day. The conversation was flowing, we laughed together while steadily climbing higher and higher on this fjell. And then, through the low-grown birch trees, the summit came into view. My natural reaction when seeing the summit is to turn around and see what kind of view is to be seen, and here, just below the summit of Akupää, the view was beautiful. Low, pine-covered hills with small lakes who were glistening from the sunlight, we could see far into the distance.</p>

<p>But, this wasn’t the summit yet. It was a few minutes further, and what awaited me there really was gorgeous.</p>

<p>We could see till Russia from the summit, observed how two Raven and an Eagle were having an air show, and in every direction you could see forest-covered hill after forest-covered hill, creating an absolutely stunning panorama of silhouettes. After spending over half an hour at the summit Henna was ready to continue, and while I could have stood there and take in the view till past sunset, I shouldered my backpack and followed her. We passed beautiful little ponds which were so still and created dazzling mirror images, and soon we were back in the embrace of the forest with its golden leafs.</p>

<p>After a while we made a proper break, with a fire, sitting down, eating a tasty meal and drinking fresh coffee. I lay down on the soft forest floor, on my bed of moss and shrubbery, while lounging in the sun and drinking another cup of coffee. <em>“This is the good life”</em> I proclaimed, and Henna agreed. We sat there in the forest, silently, happy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/48743896817/in/album-72157710868288123/" title="Fall"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48743896817_cbda0bb41b_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Fall" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A small detour on the way back was made, to a gorge, and Henna showed me where she takes guests to go camping in Tentsile tree-tents - a beautiful spot high above the gorge, which must have great views at night to the stars. We didn’t wait for the stars to come out, though - we continued on game trails back to the lake.</p>

<p>At the lake I was able to get very close to the Dragonfly you see above. Dragonflies are without a doubt my favourite insects, I love their grace and how beautiful they are. If I ever would get a tattoo, then the tattoo of a dragonfly would be high up on the list. Back at the car I thanked Henna for the beautiful hike in her backyard, and thought to myself that if more people would have a backyard like her, and care as deeply for it, the world would be a better place. On the drive back to Saariselkä I spotted a juvenile Golden Eagle which made me smile, as these birds are not so often seen that dar in the north. I also wished for a longer lens to capture it even more up-close (<a href="https://paypal.me/hendrikmorkel">You can send me a tip via PayPal</a> if you want that I can take better photos of wildlife in the future!), but I think the photo underneath is pretty good, too!</p>

<p>I stayed in Saariselkä, which is probably <em>THE</em> place to be when you want to explore the North-Eastern corner of Finnish Lapland. Besides a dozen or more options for accommodation options - I stayed at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/fi/lapland-riekonlinna.en.html?aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1">Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna‎</a> - the village lays right at the border of the Urho Kekkonen National Park and is just a short 2 hour stroll away from the Hammastunturi Wilderness Area. This means you don’t need a car to go outdoors in Saariselkä, as you can walk in a few minutes from your Hotel or log cabin to the start of a trail. Here’s the <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en.html?city=900040403&amp;aid=1603688&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&amp;room1=A">full list of Hotels and Cabins in Saariselkä</a>, and feel free to use that Affiliate Link when you’re making a reservation!</p>

<p>Getting to Saariselkä happens in one of three ways: You drive your car north for a veeeeeeery long time but are mobile there. Useful if you want to drive to different places, but hopefully you’re not alone in that car! The second and best option is to take the train and Bus. Taking the Bus from Rovaniemi to Saariselkä is a short and scenic 3 hour ride, and it really gets you in the mood for the outdoors as you ride past lakes and forests and every so often slow down to let the Reindeer get off the road. Taking an (overnight) train to Rovaniemi from Southern Finland is also very convenient, as you wake up well rested and just a short ride away from your next outdoor adventure. This is also a good way to travel if you want to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/outdoors-in-helsinki.html">explore Helsinki</a> before or after a visit in Lapland. Finally, if you come from abroad you also can fly directly to Ivalo, from where you can take a bus or Taxi to Saariselkä.</p>

<p>Saariselkä has for a village its size a variety of different options for eating out, from Anne’s Garden which serves delicious Burgers (great for backpackers who just returned to civilization!) to fine dining at Santa’s Hotel Tunturi and Lapland Hotels Riekonlinna‎ or the tasty Buffet at the Holiday Club. Cafe Porotupa at the market square makes really good coffee (On a side note, I’m always baffled how much bad coffee you get served in a variety of places in Finland, the World Champion in coffee consumption) and also fresh pancakes and cakes. If you rather cook yourself, then the supermarket in the village has everything you need, or if you need to stock-up on dehydrated meals for another backpacking trip then visit the <a href="https://www.partioaitta.fi/myymalat/saariselka/">Partioaitta Saariselkä</a>, probably the most-northern Outdoor Store in Finland!</p>

<p>During my visit at Saariselkä I participated in many different <a href="https://polarlifeoutdoor.com">Polarlife Outdoors</a> activities, include going to the Sauna and Spa at the Holiday Club, hiking on one of the dozen of trails around the village, visiting the AMAZING Aurora Open Wilderness Hut when you want to see Northern Lights, participate in a wild herbs Workshop, visit a Sauna and going to swim in a stream, or rent a Mountainbike and explore one of the many single track trails and holler with joy when you ride down the fjell!

<p>I fell in love with Meteora in 2014 before I ever have been there. As the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/petzl-roctrip-2014-turkey.html">Petzl RocTrip</a> was announced and I saw the photos from Meteora I knew that it must be a magical place, not only for climbing, but also for just being there, exploring these mountains, hiking through the forests, sucking in the famous Greek hospitality. Things turned out well in 2014 as Petzl invited me on the RocTrip, though I would join it later in Turkey (which is a gorgeous place, too). But then things again turned out well and I was invited to the AdventureNEXT Conference in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/07/multi-adventures-in-macedonia.html">Macedonia</a>, and after my fantastic Pre-Adventure I was super-psyched to finally see the rock towers of Meteora myself.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t0N8CbE7Zu4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>But before I would lay my eyes on Meteora I and my travel companions were treated to a night in a 5 Star Hotel, a visit in a winery and a sunset hike in the gorgeous mountains of Northern Greece. And after having seen this beauty I’m surprised that most people seem to be thinking about Athens, Kalymnos and the beaches when one mentions Greece. Because Greece is a lot more than those destinations, and it is off-the-beaten track where real adventure awaits.</p>

<h2 id="metsovo">Metsovo</h2>

<p>So our first off-the-beaten-track stop took us to the town of Metsovo. A calm town nestled into the side of the mountain it has a picturesque square where old men meet on Saturday morning to have a chat, narrow cobblestone streets create a maze in which you can get yourself lost and original Tabernas where you are treated to tasty greek food and wine from the <a href="http://www.ariahotels.gr/en/content/katogi/winery-12">Katogi Averoff Winery</a>. That winery we visited, and if you imagine a winery being nothing else than a collection of dusty barrels then you’re in for surprise: Besides barrels full of tasty wine the experience of walking through the wine cellar is similar to walking through a modern art museum, as you will be surprised by each turn of a corner by new colours and art, until you arrive at the bar where you’re sitting down to try the local wines.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30769610131/in/dateposted/" title="Barrels at the Katogi Averoff Hotel &amp; Winery"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5699/30769610131_d217998161_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Barrels at the Katogi Averoff Hotel &amp; Winery" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>After tasting these fine wines we continue our walk through Metsovo, passing fine old houses which enjoy wide views on the mountains around us. Locals eye us curiously and smile when we walk past, a local Taberna being our goal. A few logs burn in the open stove, from the table we enjoy a view into the kitchen, and it doesn’t take the attentive waiter to bring us some tasty starters and glasses of Katogi Averoff Wine. Laughter and smiles fill the room as we eat, and we speculate what might be next in store for our group.</p>

<p>Turns out it is a visit to the new <a href="http://www.grand-forest.gr/en">Grand Forest Metsovo</a> Hotel, which sits above the town and is surrounded by forests. But before enjoying the luxury of a warm shower and a glas of Scottish Whiskey we hit the local trail which starts in front of the hotel. The Ursa Trail is not just a pretty trail which takes one high up the mountain behind the hotel, it also hosts a <a href="http://metsovorace.gr/home-page-en">trailrunning race</a> each spring. My companions descent while I linger high up the mountain, enjoying the far views and the fresh wind in my face. I watch the sun disappear behind the hills, treasuring that memory of the lines of mountains which build up in front of me, like waves in the sea. On the way down I keep up a happy tune, because bears are indeed not seldom here, and I’d rather not be the dinner of Brown Bear tonight.</p>

<p>Back at my room I am enjoying the feeling of hot water on my skin, rubbing down the sweat and dust of a day well spent, and look forward to sit down at the table with my friends for what was a very tasty Dinner. After a final glass of wine we all go down to our suites, laying down on comfy beds and dreaming of the rock pillars of our next destination.</p>

<p>The next day started as sunny and warm as the last one, and after a delicious breakfast at the Grand Forest Metsovo Hotel we check out and board our Minibus to Meteora. It are just a few hours of driving, but already after a while I could make out from high in the mountains the faint outlines of the mountains of Meteora. The closer we got, the more excited I became. I finally would be able to see the rocks of Meteora, hike around, climb them, experience them and will never forget them. And then we were there.</p>

<h2 id="meteora">Meteora</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.visitmeteora.travel">Meteora</a>, that are immense monolithic pillars and hills that are composed of sandstone and conglomerate. Small and large pebbles stick out of them, making them one of very few places on this planet where you can see, climb and experience such rocks. And while these rocks themselves are reason enough for many people (<em>climbers!</em>) to visit Meteora, it are the seven active Eastern Orthodox monasteries on top of some of these rocks and their inhabitants which draw many, many more people. My companions and me, we were there for both - and then some. After checking in to my <a href="http://www.guesthouse-sotiriou.gr/en/index.asp">accommodation</a> (see the last photo of my wee house!) and a tasty lunch at the Restaurant Meteora we were hitting the trail up one of the rocks.</p>

<p>Hiking and scrambling up these pillars is a great way to get a feel of the land. We hiked quite a bit over the next few days, through shady Oak forests, past small, hidden monasteries, up unlikely paths with stunning views, never far away from the big monasteries but never meeting another soul out on the trail.</p>

<p>That changed when we went to visit some of the monasteries. There many souls were looking for something, while those living there were sometimes happy enough to pass on ancient wisdom which they have studied in their books. I joined in on these monastery visits, curious to see if an atheist like me can find spiritual enlightenment here, but alas all I found was beautiful architecture and even prettier views on the surrounding nature. Nature is probably as close to my religion as Islam and Buddhism are to others, and as long as we don’t get preachy or hostile with each others I believe we all can happy co-exist on this planet.</p>

<p>And what brings me close to my god? Hiking, packrafting, cycling, flying, skiing and climbing in it. In this case I chose to worship nature by going climbing. Together with my Greek partner Kosta, a local Mountain Guide, we hit up the Pillar of the Rain, an easy 5c route to get me into familiarity with the rock of Meteora. Climbing these routes which are <em>boldly bolted</em> (as in, you better be fine by standing five meters over your last pro) was such an amazing experience, I probably was smiling all the time being able to climb on this fantastic rock. It is just so much fun. Too quick we topped out, then left a note in the summit register and then rappelled down. I could have continued the rest of the day climbing, though I know there will be more days of climbing in Meteora in my future so I have no regrets of not having climbed more that day.</p>

<p>Well, actually we also went scrambling that same morning. Scrambling up on a Via Cordata Tour we were clipped in to ropes while climbing up steep hills, navigating on airy ledges to arrive on a look-out over the city of Kalambaka. It was another great experience of climbing &amp; scrambling among these pillars, and if you’re less inclined to rock climbing then you will surely find this a suitable and safe yet adrenaline-filled adventure.</p>

<p>That brings me to the food, because somehow one has to fuel his body for all these adventures. The meals were delicious, from the Saganaki we ate at Restaurant Meteora, the oldest restaurant in town, which was so tasty, my mouth is watering just writing about it. Or the Gyros we ate off the main street, and many other meals - I can not recall a dish I wasn’t excited about while eating in Greece. The fresh ingredients, the passion &amp; talent of the chefs, the great atmosphere, it all makes eating out in Greece a superb experience - and is very affordable, too.</p>

<p>And too quick to my liking our visit to <a href="https://www.visitmeteora.travel">Meteora</a> was over. Together with my friends Rupert and Bernand I was sitting on a late, sunny afternoon in our bus on the way to Thessaloniki, from where we would fly out the next morning. It was hard to leave this magical place with its friendly people, tasty food, beautiful nature and unique climbing, but I am looking forward to visit again with my family some day soon, and then share this unreal experience with them again.</p>

<p><strong>Food</strong>: Go eat at the <a href="http://meteora-restaurant.gr/restaurant%20in%20meteora.html">Meteora Restaurant</a> in the centre, their food is superb. The <a href="http://www.meteoronpanorama.gr/el/english/">Meteoron Panorama Restaurant</a> has great views &amp; tasty food. The Gyros in the small Fast Food Shop on the main street, not far from the Meteora Restaurant is great for lunch.</p>

Check out the <a href="https://www.meteorahotels.com">Hotel Meteora</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Things to do</strong> (<em>Other than climbing</em>): <strong>Visits to the monasteries</strong> are very popular, and for a good reason. Perched atop these pillars and constructed over centuries of hard labour, they’re inspiring places to visit. Entry fees range from 3 to 5€ and you should check beforehand when which Monastery is open for visitors.</p>

<p><strong>Hiking</strong> is free and you can combine it with a monatery visit. Lots of fine trails weave around and through the pillars, just pick one, take enough water and go for a nice stroll.</p>

<p><strong>Egyptian vultures</strong> breed at Meteora, and if your lucky you can catch a glimpse of one of these rare birds of prey (we were lucky!). There’s a feeding station where you can watch them from a safe distance - bring binoculars!</p>

<p>Oh, and don’t miss the <strong>Sunset Tours</strong>. They might seem kitschy, but watching the sun set on these pillars is a memorable experience - not just for photographers!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Macedonia?</em> As I was invited to the AdventureNEXT Balkans conference and the possibility of exploring this small Balkan country I didn’t hesitate long and said yes. Several days of hiking, climbing, mountaineering, caving and paddling adventures were to be had, and big smiles and wide views to be experienced.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26634875673/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Poppies!"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7102/26634875673_b6f0315fee_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Poppies!" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="skopje-the-capital">Skopje, the capital</h2>

<p>I arrived late in the evening in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, and was lucky enough to share a ride with three fellow AdventureNEXT attendants to the hotel. While I was travelling since 4 am of that day I didn’t feel like hitting the hay just yet, and so I went with James and Bernard to explore the centre a wee bit. Unknown to the outside world there were daily peaceful demonstrations in Skopje, called the colourful revolution. The signs of these could be seen on the dozens of monuments in the centre, as the demonstrators threw colourful bombs on them. We walked past the river to the central square and then on a more busy street back to the hotel, where I finally felt tired enough to hit the hay.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26634874703/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Colourful Revolution, Skopje"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7347/26634874703_412ee3054a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Colourful Revolution, Skopje" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The next morning I went off on my own to explore the city more. There’s an old castle on a hill overlooking the city, which made for a easy first destination. The entry to it is free and you get some nice views towards the centre and the hills behind it, as well as the distant mountains which we would be exploring a bit later on. After that I took a look at the Mosque Mustapha Pasha, which was a beautiful building. While I am anti-religious I really like Mosques with their Minaretts and their calls to prayer. They are beautiful structures and the people one meets there are in my experience always friendly and kind, much unlike what mainstream media would like you to believe about Moslems.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27143388722/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Skopje Fortress"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7417/27143388722_cab6e0aa1a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="655" alt="Skopje Fortress" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I wandered downwards towards the Old Bazaar of Skopje, where plenty of shops offered their goods for trade. Impressive was the street of gold, where one jewellery store was to the next and I was just left but wondering: Who has the money to buy these things, or are they cheap? As I’m also not really into gold, silver and diamonds I didn’t find out and just strolled on through the narrow streets of the Old Bazaar. Delicious smells from small restaurants wafted through the air and I was reminded by my stomach that it might just be time to eat. After I changed some Euros into the local currency I found a nice restaurant which served a delicious plate of kebap and salad. The old gentlemen was friendly and warm, and even when we didn’t share a common language we were able to communicate with hand &amp; feet and I got what I wanted.</p>

<p>With a belly full of good food and after a coffee I went on to explore the city more - the large square where pompous classical music was blarring out of hidden speakers, and then I wandered over the old Stone Bridge and was pondering for a moment if it would be possible to still take a hike up the hill next to the city. But the clock was late and I was about to meet my fellow adventurers, so I headed back to the hotel. After a dozen introductions we went for another exploration of Skopje, and much to my amusement it was almost identical to the round I made on my own in the morning. This time, however, we had our guides along who were able to tell us a bit more about the buildings, structures and monuments. It was very interesting, and if you like to explore old cities then Skopje is definitely worth a visit.</p>

<h2 id="hiking-climbing-and-paddling-at-matka-canyon">Hiking, climbing and paddling at Matka Canyon</h2>

<p>Matka Canyon is a mere 40 minute bus ride away from downtown Skopje so I already was fearing it’d be overrun with visitors who wanted to escape the city for the weekend. However, it was happily not the case! Our bus dropped us off at a bridge which crossed the river and then we hiked on a fine singletrack trail up into the mountains. It was simply lovely hiking with great views and lush green flowers &amp; plants along the track. We glimpsed views into the canyon and also towards our destination up on the hill, where we would be climbing in the morning.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27240432415/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Trail markers"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7739/27240432415_ea7a1873aa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Trail markers" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As we arrived up on the hill a beautiful old &amp; small monastary welcomed us and there was already quite a bit of activity from local climbing club members - there was going to be a climbing festival there this weekend from the <a href="">Macedonian Alpine Club</a>, and after us a steady stream of climbers arrived throughout the morning. Our guides set up a top rope and everyone was encouraged to go and try the fairly easy route, and almost everyone made it to the top 30 m higher up - even those who were climbing the first time in their life! I was eager to get some more climbing in and did one more route on a nice arete, but then it was sadly already time to move on as we were scheduled to go paddling.</p>

<p>The packs came back on and then it was happily just downhill until the shore down in the canyon. We rang a bell which resulted in a boat coming over to pick us up and ferry us over to the other side, where we quickly changed into clothes which could get wet - as we were going to be paddling for an hour in sit-on-top kayaks. I paired up with Avery, a fellow Journalist, and soon we were finding our rhytm and navigated our kayak over the turquoise waters of the Matka Canyon. After an hour of paddling through the steep canyon we arrived at a cave which some of us went in, but as I didn’t bring any shoes &amp; didn’t fancy walking through bat poop I waited outside. Just as we set out to paddle back we could hear the distant thunder in the mountains, and so it meant faster paddling in order to not get soaked and electrocuted by lightning.</p>

<p>Obviously we made it out alive, and as we were back on the shore it was time for lunch - at 17 o’clock! We had a short transfer to a local restaurant which served delicious vegetables which were grown in the garden behind the house and while we munched our starters a Gipsy Brass Band entered the local and set off to play for us. It was a great atmosphere as these passionate musicians played their instruments, and many of us felt the beat and one saw wipping feet. Well fed and feeling tired after a day of hiking, climbing and paddling we drove back to Skopje. As the next morning we would transfer to another area of the country it meant packing up - happily I travelled light!</p>

<h2 id="standing-on-a-summit-and-watching-into-kosovo">Standing on a summit and watching into Kosovo</h2>

<p>In case you didn’t know: I really do not like the transportation part of travelling. Bus and train rides as well as flying are pretty boring and a utter waste of time for me, and riding in a bus on small mountain roads which wind up the hill in serpentines is about the last ting I really want to do. Alas, this was what was in store for us this morning. We rode for several hours to Staro Selo where we transferred into 4 x 4s which shuttled us up the mountain to the Vila Ljuboten. This, happily, marked the end of the first transportation part of the day, and from here on we’d be using our own feet to move.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27997697920/in/dateposted/" title="Signs"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7639/27997697920_b36043e256_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Signs" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>After sitting for over three hours in a bus and car moving my feet in the mountains was exactly what I wanted, and happily also Tim, Matthias, Avery and Bernard felt that way. We set at a good pace off from the hut, with the goal being the summit of Ljuboten. Alas, in a big group the speed goes down pretty quickly, and so the five of us made a break-out and went ahead. Soon we reached a sign post &amp; decided it’d be just the right thing to do to wait for our guides and the rest of the group, and ask for permission to go ahead to the summit.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27663642853/in/dateposted/" title="Looking back"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8584/27663642853_1fb5e764a5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Looking back" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Upon reaching us the guides gave us permission to make a summit attempt, and with the weather being a mixed back and a thick layer of snow on the ridge to the summit we weren’t sure how far we would come, so if our attempt would be crowned by success was unsure. For starters it was easy hiking until the upper snow field, and as a group of Macedonian mountaineers were just coming down from the summit we decided that we could also try it. The ridge towards the summit of Ljuboten falls pretty steep off towards the left, and just slightly less to the right, so it was careful hiking upwards.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28200770821/in/dateposted/" title="Snowy Ljuboten Summit ridge"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8758/28200770821_7ac74e6c7a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snowy Ljuboten Summit ridge" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We were surprised how easy &amp; short it was in the end to reach the summit. We smiled and enjoyed the views as we stood on the broad summit shoulder: Down into the clouds towards the north we looked into Kosovo, and down towards the south we could see far into Macedonia. The clouds were racing around us, it was windy and there was thunder in the distance, so after a summit selfie we carefully proceeded to descent. The snowy ridge demanded concentration when going down, but as soon as we left the snow behind it was fast &amp; easy hiking again. We soon met up with the rest of our group which were waiting further down for us, and then we decended together towards the Vila Ljuboten and again a rather late lunch. After such a fine hike the food tasted amazing, and while the Macedonian kitchen often felt like it was the same the natural ingredients and fresh mountain air made this probably one of the best meals I ate in Macedonia.</p>

<h2 id="caving-with-bats-at-makedonski-brod">Caving with bats at Makedonski Brod</h2>

<p>After that tasty lunch we had another bus travel section, and we arrived at dawn at our next hotel close to the Mavrovo National Park. I slept in a beautiful apartment overlooking the village, but the real treat was definitely waking up and seeing the mountains from my window the next morning. Sadly instead of going to explore the surrounding mountains and villages on foot we had another transfer that morning, but happily it wasn’t too long. We arrived at the basecamp of the <a href="http://www.ursusspeleos.com.mk/index_en.htm">Macedonian Caving Society</a>, and after dressing up in our red overalls and helmets we were off to the Gorna Slatinska cave with our guides.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26633789634/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Valley view"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7070/26633789634_f2c37ae3a9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Valley view" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Now I’d lie if I didn’t say that I was thinking <em>Meh</em> about the caving before we entered the cave. I was not really excited about the whole caving thing, but what followed really was my favourite part of this Multi-activity trip. The Gorna Slatinska cave is around 400 m long and we needed with our group of six around 45 to 60 minutes from one end to the other. Those 400 m under the earth were just fantastic, with stalagmites and stalactites which grew over hundreds of years, small chambers and tight spots which one needed to squeeze through and then small climbs to get up or down. And of course the bats. I’d go as far as saying that Batman is my favourite comic character (Rorschach from Watchmen being a close second), so being in a cave with bats was just a very cool experience. There were hundreds of bats of all sizes flying around us, or hanging sleeping from the ceiling. As we exited the cave and the sunshine was again shining on us I had a huge smile on my face. I would do this again in an instant as it was just such a outlandish yet inspiring experience, so if you’re not too afraid of tight spaces I would urge you to go and explore the Makedonski Brod caves!</p>

<p>Well, after I looked a last time into the mouth of the cave which I just had exited we walked the short distance back to the basecamp, where one of the guides was already busy at the BBQ grill. While the other group went to explore the cave we were having a beer and chating excitedly about the experience, and as our friends were back we shared a delicious feast of vegetables, beans, chicken and meats before we headed onwards to Ohrid and the AdventureNEXT conference - that, however, is another story for another day!</p>

<h2 id="getting-there--accommodation">Getting there &amp; accommodation</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.turkishairlines.com/">Turkish Airlines</a> flew me from Helsinki via Istanbul to Skopje and I need to say as far as airlines go they do a very good job. Punctual, friendly and with full service (yes, that means a 3-course meal in economic class as well as an <em>“open bar”</em>) I really liked my flights with them. They have their own Chef on board which apparently cooks for the business class passengers, but who then also would happily help out in the back of the plane.</p>

<p>The trip I was on was organized by <a href="http://www.macedoniaexperience.com">Macedonia Experience</a> which I found a friendly &amp; professional outfit. The guides knew what they were doing (always good when setting up anchors for climbing, paddlling, moving in the mountains and caving) and looked after evryone in the group. We had a condensed version of their normal <a href="http://www.macedoniaexperience.com/active/2013-04-05-15-20-38/multi-active-tour-of-macedonia">Multi-Activity Trip</a> and the normal tour you can book is longer and more relaxed. If you don’t want to go off exploring by yourself but rather have someone who has taken care of everything, give them your business.</p>

<p>In Skopje we stayed at the <a href="http://www.duvet.mk">Hotel Duvet</a> which was central, clean and friendly. I liked the breakfast terrace overlooking the city towards the hills, and the rooms were pretty big (in case that’s important to you).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.vilaljuboten.com/">Vila Ljuboten</a> at the foot of the mountain of the same name also offers very basic rooms, so if you want to stay up in the mountains that would be a good place.</p>

<p><a href="Www.tutto.com.mk">Hotel Tutto</a> in the Mavrovo national park has great rooms and apartments overlooking the valley, and their breakfast &amp; dinner is also fantastic. If you’re into slowfood, herbs and spices this place is well worth checking in to, as the owner has a wealth of knowledge in this area and is happy to share it.</p>
